Thus in cultures where the aerobes are present in suspension, each unit of 02 added to the coculture would be reflected by a unit of BOD stolen from the anaerobes (Gerritse et al. 1990; Kato et al. 1993a; Shelton & Tiedje 1984). Thus anaerobic microorganisms can only be maintained in such cocultures if the supply of substrate in terms of BOD is greater than the transfer of 02 into the liquid phase. Since the aerobic or facultative bacteria adequately consume the limited O2 supplied, the resulting dissolved oxygen concentration in the bulk liquid phase will be very low (Gerritse & Gottschal 1993; Gerritse et al. 1990). Studies with anaerobic-aerobic cocultures reveal that methanogens can be maintained in aerated conditions if the 02 supply is not excessive (Gerritse & Gottschal 1993; Gerritse et al. 1990; Scott et al. 1983). In one study, three defined cocultures of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria were established in 02 limited chemostats: 1) Methanobacteriumformicicum together with the aerobic heterotroph Comamonas testosteroni; 2) M. formicicum together with the aerobic methanotroph Methyloeystis sp. ; and 3) Methanosarcina barkeri together with C. testosteroni (Gerritse & Gottschal 1993). Growth of the methanogenic and aerobic bacteria occurred over extended periods of time (200 h). Cocultures with C. testosteroni were found to be more stable than those with the methanotroph. The former bacteria had a higher affinity for 0 2 resulting in lower levels of dissolved oxygen which protected the methanogens better against 02 poisoning. The methanotroph, however, was able to consume methane produced by M. formicicum. The dissolved oxygen in the chemostats was lower than the detection limit of 0.0064 mg L -1. However, based on growth kinetics, it was calculated that the dissolved oxygen concentration ranged from 0.0002 to 0.0013 mg L -1. The growth rate of M. formicicum was reduced by 50% at dissolved oxygen concentrations of approximately 0.00064 mg L-1 while such reductions in the growth rate were not observed for M. barkeri at concentrations up to 0.0013 mg L -1. Similar experiments were also conducted in chemostats with an undefined mixed culture enriched under anaerobic conditions with formate, peptone and yeast extract as substrate, resulting in a formate degrading methanogenic consortia (Gerritse et al. 1990). A gradual increase in the 02 supply initially enhanced the rate of methane production by 20%. This phenomenon has also been observed by others and is attributed to the production of unknown 'growth factors' by the facultative bacteria (Pirt & Lee 1983; Scott et al. 1983). As the 02 input was increased further, methanogens could be maintained in the chemostat until all volatile organic acid fermentation products (derived from the fermentation of peptone and yeast extract) were fully consumed by the facultative bacteria. Afterwards, further increments of 02 supply resulted in the wash-out of methanogens and accumulation of formate since the fermentation products were needed to consume incoming 02. The coexistence of anaerobes and aerobes in one environment has also been studied with other obligate anaerobic bacteria. Sulfate reduction has repeatedly been observed under aerated conditions if facultative or aerobic bacteria simultaneously consume 02 (Battersby et al. 1985; Cypionka et al. 1985; Jurgensen 1977; Marschall et al.
