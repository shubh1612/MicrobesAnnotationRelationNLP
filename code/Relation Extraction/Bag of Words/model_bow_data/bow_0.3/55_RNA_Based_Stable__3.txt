The 16S rRNA gene fragments were amplified by PCR, using primers B27f and U1492r (56), and sequenced as described previously (26). PCR amplification and sequencing were repeated several times to check for amplification errors. The determined nucleotide sequences were aligned with the sequences of reference strains in the Rhodocyclaceae family, using Clustal W, version 1.7 (50). A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the evolutionary distance data (28) by the neighbor-joining method (45). The bootstrap resampling method of Felsenstein (18) was used with 1,000 replicates to evaluate the robustness of the branches of the inferred tree. BTX degradation test (cold test).All manipulations were performed in an anaerobic glove box. A sterile basal salt medium (26) (30 ml) was prepared in a 70-ml glass bottle and supplemented with NaNO3 (2 mM), titanium chloride (pH 7.0, 2 mM), and resazurin (2 mg liter−1). The medium was inoculated with approximately 106 cells of a bacterial strain pregrown in dCGY medium, and the bottle was sealed with a Teflon-coated butyl rubber septum (approximately 3 mm in thickness) secured with a crimped aluminum cap. Benzene was added to the bottle at a final concentration of 15 μM from an anaerobic stock solution (3 mM in sterilized water) by use of a syringe. Alternatively, toluene or m-, p-, or o-xylene was added to the bottle at a final concentration of 100 μM, using a microsyringe. Uninoculated controls were prepared in the same manner. The bottle was incubated at 25°C in the dark without shaking. The stopper-sealed orifice of the bottle was always kept below the surface of the medium to avoid adsorption of benzene to the rubber stopper (1, 41, 42, 43). All incubations were prepared in triplicate. Samples were taken from the bottle by use of a syringe at appropriate intervals and analyzed as described below. Radiorespirometry.Radiorespirometry was conducted to investigate the mineralization of benzene by bacterial isolates. Isolated strains were grown in dCGY medium, and the cells were collected by centrifugation. They were inoculated anaerobically at 106 cells ml−1 in 30 ml of basal salt medium containing 2 mM NaNO3 as described above. The culture was supplemented with 37 kBq [14C]benzene from an anaerobic labeled stock solution prepared by diluting universally labeled [14C]benzene (2,220 MBq mmol−1; Sigma) with anoxic sterile water to give a final radioactivity of 148 kBq ml−1. The bottle was incubated at 25°C in the dark without shaking, as described above. The culture was prepared in triplicate. To quantify the 14CO2 produced from [14C]benzene, the medium was flushed with reduced-copper-treated nitrogen gas (>99.999% pure) through a series of traps comprised of a first trap containing 10 ml of cold benzene (for trapping the labeled benzene) and second and third traps containing 10 ml of 0.4 N NaOH (for trapping 14CO2). Before being flushed, the medium was acidified with 7 ml of 2 N H2SO4 to convert carbonate to CO2. For measurements of the radioactivity in the 14CO2 traps, 3 ml of solution was sampled from each trap, mixed with 10 ml of scintillation cocktail (ScintiVers; Perkin-Elmer), and subjected to analysis in a model 1900CA Tri-Carb liquid scintillation analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). The efficiencies of the CO2 traps were checked by using NaH14CO3 (24). A mineralization ratio (MR) was estimated by using the equation MR (%) = (R − Rc)/Rb × 100, where R is the radioactivity in the CO2 trap for a bacterial culture, Rc is the radioactivity in the CO2 trap for the uninoculated control, and Rb is the radioactivity of [14C]benzene initially added to the culture. Analytical procedures.Concentrations of sulfate and nitrate were determined by ion chromatography with an ICA-2000 ion analyzer (DKK Toa). A total direct count of microbial cells in a liquid sample was determined by fluorescence microscopy after staining with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (55). In order to determine BTX concentrations, a headspace sample (100 μl) was analyzed on a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-17A) equipped with a 30-m DB-624 capillary column (0.53 mm in diameter, 3 μm in film thickness; J&W Scientific) and a flame ionization detector.
