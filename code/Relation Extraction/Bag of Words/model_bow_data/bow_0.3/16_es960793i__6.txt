Plant germination data (where applicable) were compared between treatments using the χ2 test with a continuity correction or the Irwin−Fisher exact test. A sample size of 100 seeds per treatment can detect a 20% treatment effect when the control group germination rate is ≥60%. The plant dry weight data were analyzed by analysis of variance, followed by the method of least significant difference (LSD) for assessing treatment effects (55). Results and Discussion Hydrocarbon Biodegradation in Oily Soils. The initial soil concentrations of the applied hydrocarbon varied from 12 000 to 14 000 mg/kg, from 26 000 to 27 000 mg/kg and from 4000 to 9600 mg/kg TPH-Gr for the heavy, medium, and light oils, respectively. Most duplicate soil samples taken at each time point were within 10−20% of each other based on bulk hydrocarbon analysis. Profiles of the decline in oil hydrocarbons during soil bioremediation are shown in Figure 1. Table 1 is a summary of the initial and final (8−11 months) hydrocarbon levels in both soils as analyzed by TPH-Gr, TPH-IR, and O&G methods. The TPH-Gr data show that the heavy, medium, and light oils were significantly degraded in low (Norwood) and high (Norwood/Baccto) organic soils. The overall maximum decline in TPH was similar for the two soils, but different between oil types. For example, the decrease in TPH in soils with heavy, medium, or light oils was 10−50%, 65−70%, and 75−90% of the initial TPH-Gr levels after 8−11 months (see Table 3). Similar net reductions in heavy, medium, and light hydrocarbons were noted for both soils based on O&G (5 and 45%; 55 and 60%; 50 and 80%) and TPH-IR (12 and 73%; 70−80%; 95%) analyses (see Table 1). Calculation of the TPH-Gr rates of degradation (based on best-fit first-order equation during the first 4 months) was highly variable between soils and oils. In general, degradation rates were greater in the high organic Norwood/Baccto soil for the medium (73%/month) and light (81%/month) oil and lower (13−31%/month) for the heavy oil in either soil and for the three oils in the lower organic Norwood soil (Table 1). Lowest hydrocarbon levels in all oily soils were achieved within 4 months, and further biotreatment did not significantly decrease hydrocarbons. TPH-Gr analyses from the soil with heavy crude were the most variable (Figure 1) in which concentrations of TPH-Gr (also TPH-IR, data not shown) in the Norwood/Baccto soil samples varied from 5000 to 13 500 mg/kg during the 9-month treatment. These variations were not observed with the O&G analysis (profile not shown). It is possible that compounds extracted from the high organic soil interfered with removal of polar petroleum hydrocarbons during the silica gel adsorption step for the TPH determi nation. Indeed, inaccuracies (up to 85% relative error) and biases in the use of silica gel for the determination of TPH in soils containing petroleum products have been discussed by George (56). The heavy crude oil contains a larger fraction (44%) of polar material than the medium and light oils. Analyses of hydrocarbons (mainly saturates and aromatics extracted with CH2Cl2) based on a simulated gas chromatographic distillation profile in the range of C11−C44 in untreated and bioremediated oily soils are summarized in Table 2. The extent of biodegradation of hydrocarbons was higher (70−90%) for those compounds in the C11−C22 range and lower for those in the C23−C33 (40−60%) and C34−C44 (35−60%) ranges. These degradation values are consistent with the decline in the hydrocarbon concentrations observed in both oily soil types based on TPH-Gr, TPH-IR, and O&G determinations (Table 1). The data also indicate that 8−18% more hydrocarbons were degraded in the higher organic carbon soil (Norwood/Baccto mixture) as compared to the Norwood soil. Residual hydrocarbons (C11−C44 fractions) in biotreated soils containing heavy and medium oils was 4500−8200 and 850−1825 mg/kg in the soil with light oil. These hydrocarbon concentrations are also consistent with those TPH residues (8000−10 000 mg/kg for the heavy and medium oily soils and 1000 mg/kg for the light oily soils) that remain after bioremediation (see Figure 1). Leaching Potential of Oily Soils. It has been recognized that the predominant leachable components from petroleum-containing wastes are the more water-soluble hydrocarbons benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX). Table 2 shows data on the residual BTEX components in the six oily soils before and after bioremediation.
