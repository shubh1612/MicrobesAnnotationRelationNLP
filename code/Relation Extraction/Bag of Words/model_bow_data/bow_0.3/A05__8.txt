Outlook â€“ what is needed for a better understanding of the mechanisms of anaerobic benzene degradation? Isolating strictly anaerobic benzene-degrading bacteria is still important for a better understanding of anaerobic benzene degradation. Sequencing the genome of such an organism may allow revealing the upper and lower degradation pathway; also more controlled physiological experiments would be possible for elucidating the anaerobic benzene activation mechanism. However, the gene encoding the responsible enzyme might be not yet detectable within the genome due to the unknown enzyme properties. Establishing any in vitro or in vivo assay undoubtedly proving a specific activation mechanism is clearly needed. For highly enriched benzene-degrading cultures, sequencing of the metagenome might be very helpful to clarify syntrophic or cooperative relationships, as, for example, recently shown for anaerobic methane oxidation (Meyerdierks et al., 2010). If a metagenome is available, mRNA expression or proteomic studies may follow for further functional characterization (Ram et al., 2005; Meyerdierks et al., 2010).
