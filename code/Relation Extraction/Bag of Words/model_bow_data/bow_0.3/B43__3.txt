The vortexing and centrifugation steps were repeated once. The soil pellet was resuspended in 8 ml lysis solution I (0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 M EDTA, pH 8.0, 15 mg lysozyme/ml), mixed and incubated at 37°C for 1 h with occasional gentle mixing. Eight milliliters lysis solution II (0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% SDS) was added. The soil suspension was passed through three cycles of freezing at −70°C for 20 min and thawing at 65°C for 20 min. The supernatant was transferred after centrifugation for 10 min at 7,700 g, and 2.7 ml 5 M NaCl, 2.1 ml 10% CTAB (cetyl trimethylammonium bromide in 0.7 M NaCl) were added into supernatant, mixed, and incubated for 10 min at 65°C. An equal volume of CHCl3:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was added, mixed, and centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 g. The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube. An equal volume of 13% PEG (polyethylene glycol, 8,000 MW in 1.6 M NaCl) was added to the supernatants, incubated on ice for 30 min or at 4°C overnight, and then centrifuged at 4°C for 10 min at 12,000 g. The supernatants were decanted. The pellet was washed with 5 ml 70% cold ethanol and air dried. The air-dried pellet was resuspended in 750 µl TER (0.2 mg RNase/ml TE, where TE is 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Ammonium acetate (10 M; NH4OAc) was added to crude DNA extracts, obtained above, to a final concentration of 2.5 M; the mixture was put on ice for 1 h or at 4°C overnight, and centrifuged for 15 min at full speed in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The supernatant was transferred into another tube; the pellet was redissolved in TE and 2.5 M NH4OAc and precipitated again. Two volumes of ethanol was added to the supernatants, mixed, and centrifuged for 30 min at full speed. The pellet was washed with 500 µl 70% cold ethanol, and air dried. The pellet was redissolved in 750 µl TE. DNA extract was passed through a Magic Minipreps Column (Magic Minipreps DNA Purification System, Promega Co., Madison, Wis.) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Fifty milliliters of 80°C preheated TE was used to elute DNA from the column. Concentrations of DAN solution were determined by using a DNA fluorometer (Model TKO 100, Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, Calif.) with bisbenzamide dye (Hoechest 33258, Sigma Chemical Co.) in 1× TNE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.4) [18]. Traces of soil organic matter in soil DNA may result in overestimation by binding to dye or underestimation by inhibiting fluorescence. Concentrations of pure Escherichia coli genomic DNA were underestimated fluorometrically when added to soil solution. The interference of organic matter was successfully accounted for by subtraction of DNase-digestible fluorescence (data not shown). The interference of trace humic acid was accounted for by DNase digestion (50 mg/ml, 25 mM MgCl2) at 37°C for 2 h. Concentrations of soil DNA were determined in the range from 0.2 to 2.5 mg DNA/g soil for samples from the Pullman soil site. Hybridization Soil DNA (0.5–1 µg) was denatured by boiling in 0.5 M NaOH for 10 min, chilling in ice, and then neutralizing by addition of onethird volume of cold 3 M NH4OAC. The denatured DNA was blotted onto a Nytran nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, N.H.) using a Bio-dot microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif.). The membrane was baked for 2 h at 80°C, in vacuum, before prehybridization. The strains and genes used for probes in this study are listed in Table 1. Dilution series of DNA from all gene probes were similarly applied to these membranes. The dilution series corresponding to the probe for a given hybridization served as a positive control and quantitative standard for each hybridization, and the other standard DNAs served as negative controls. Genomic DNA was isolated from E. coli and Bradyrhizobium japonicum by standard methods [23] and used as the negative controls for the group I Pseudomonas probe. Probes were prepared by digestion of plasmids with the appropriate enzymes, followed by recovery of the inserts from agarose by Gene Clean (Bio 101).
