Microbial Community Analysis of a Coastal Salt Marsh Affected by the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. Abstract Coastal salt marshes are highly sensitive wetland ecosystems that can sustain long-term impacts from anthropogenic events such as oil spills. In this study, we examined the microbial communities of a Gulf of Mexico coastal salt marsh during and after the influx of petroleum hydrocarbons following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Total hydrocarbon concentrations in salt marsh sediments were highest in June and July 2010 and decreased in September 2010. Coupled PhyloChip and GeoChip microarray analyses demonstrated that the microbial community structure and function of the extant salt marsh hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations changed significantly during the study. The relative richness and abundance of phyla containing previously described hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria) increased in hydrocarbon-contaminated sediments and then decreased once hydrocarbons were below detection. Firmicutes, however, continued to increase in relative richness and abundance after hydrocarbon concentrations were below detection. Functional genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation were enriched in hydrocarbon-contaminated sediments then declined significantly (p<0.05) once hydrocarbon concentrations decreased. A greater decrease in hydrocarbon concentrations among marsh grass sediments compared to inlet sediments (lacking marsh grass) suggests that the marsh rhizosphere microbial communities could also be contributing to hydrocarbon degradation. The results of this study provide a comprehensive view of microbial community structural and functional dynamics within perturbed salt marsh ecosystems. Introduction The explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20, 2010 released an estimated 4.9 million barrels of crude oil [1], [2], [3] and an estimated 1.7×1011 g of volatile hydrocarbons [4] into the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Crude oil reached the coast of Alabama by June 2010 and after approximately one month at sea the oil that impacted coastal areas was weathered and presented in the form of oil sheens and tar balls/mats [5], [6]. Coastal wetlands are among the most productive habitats in the world that act as nurseries for fisheries, sinks for anthropogenic contaminants, and provide protection from shoreline erosion [7]. Wetland environments are highly sensitive to oil contamination due to low tidal wave energy and the presence of marsh grasses that allow pollutants to remain sequestered in coastal sediments for years [8], [9]. Traditional mechanical remediation processes, such as low-pressure flushing and vacuum/pumping, may adversely affect marsh environments or irreparably damage these sensitive ecosystems [10], [11]. Two coastal marshes equally affected by heavy oiling from the Amoco Cadiz in 1978 were compared after one site received aggressive cleaning and the other was left untouched. Fifteen years later the cleaned marsh showed ∼30% decrease in vegetative area compared to a 21% increase in the size of the marsh that did not receive cleanup [12]. Thus, in many cases natural attenuation through microbial oil biodegradation processes is a preferred course of action in contaminated salt marshes to limit or prevent long-term habitat loss. A number of environmental factors can enhance or limit natural attenuation or in situ bioremediation of oil, including temperature, salinity, nutrient availability, oxygen, physical state of the oil, and the natural microbial community [13]. Biodegradation of hydrocarbons is enhanced at higher temperatures (during summer months) when microbial activity is increased and oil viscosity is lower when compared to winter months. Tar balls and/or mousse are less viscous at higher temperatures and have more surface area available for physical breakdown and/or microbial degradation within sediments [14]. The most rapid rates of microbial hydrocarbon degradation occur under aerobic conditions when compared to anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation [15], [16]. Inorganic nutrients (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron) essential for microbial hydrocarbon degradation are replete in many marsh systems (due to land run-off). Another critical factor affecting the bioremediation of oil is the structure of the natural microbial community. Within GoM coastal ecosystems, microbial communities have adapted to hydrocarbon exposure as a result of chronic release from natural hydrocarbon seeps [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Thus, these GoM microbial communities represent a unique contrast to those present within coastal ecosystems that do not have exposure to hydrocarbon release. There is a paucity of information regarding the in situ structure and function of salt marsh microbial communities in coastal GoM environments impacted by oil contamination. To date, studies that examine the microbial response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill have described beach [22], [23] and open ocean [2], [24], [25], [26], [27] environments.
