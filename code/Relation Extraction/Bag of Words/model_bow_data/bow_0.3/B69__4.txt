All data are presented as mean±s.e. ***Po0.01, **Po0.05, *Po0.1. Figure 5 The normalized signal intensity of bbs (b-oxidation of benzylsuccinate) genes for anaerobic toluene degradation. The signal intensity for each sequence was the average of the total signal intensity from all the replicates. Gene number is the protein ID number for each gene as listed in the GenBank database. All data are presented as mean±s.e. ***Po0.01, **Po0.05, *Po0.1. In total, seven probes were designed for bbs genes in GeoChip 4.0 and three probes were detected in the samples. Marine microbial communities for potential bioremediation of oil spills Z Lu et al 455 The ISME Journal pmoA genes for methane monooxygenase were detected in the plume samples. Specifically, mcrA genes from Methanococcus aeolicus Nankai-3, Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1 and Methanocorpusculum labreanum Z were detected in all of the oil plume samples, but most of them were from uncultured microorganisms. Significantly (Po0.05) higher signal intensities were observed for mcrA in the plume than in the non-plume samples (Supplementary Figure S5). However, no significant differences were found for pmoA and mmoX (particulate methane monooxygenase) between plume and nonplume samples. Nitrogen. Petroleum generally contains about 0.1–2% nitrogen, and given the large quantities of oil involved, it may act as an N pool in this ecosystem. Interestingly, nasA (nitrate reductase) and nir (nitrite reductase) for assimilatory N reduction, and gdh (glutamate dehydrogenase) for ammonia assimilation exhibited significantly (Po0.05 or 0.01) higher signal intensities in plume samples (Figure 6). The observed stimulation of N assimilation processes could be due to an increase of microbial biomass (Hazen et al., 2010). However, no significant differences were observed for other N-cycling genes, for example, nitrification, denitrification and N fixation (Figure 6). Sulfur. Sulfite reduction genes were highly abundant in the deep-sea plume: 81–102 dsrA/B genes for dissimilatory sulfite reductase, and 8–12 AprA genes for dissimilatory adenosine-50 -phosphosulfate reductase were detected with significantly (Po0.05) higher abundance in the plume than in non-plume samples (Supplementary Figure S6). Microbial populations similar to Alkalilimnicola ehrlichei MLHE-1, Chlorobium ferrooxidans DSM 13031, Clostridium leptum DSM 753, Desulfomicrobium thermophilum, Pyrobaculum calidifontis JCM 11548, Thermodesulforhabdus norvegica, Magnetococcus sp. MC-1, Pyrobaculum aerophilum str. IM2, Alkalilimnicola ehrlichei MLHE-1, Desulfohalobium retbaense DSM 5692, sulfate-reducing bacterium QLNR1 and Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans MPOB were frequently detected in each sample, while most of the genes detected were from uncultured microorganisms (for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria) from various environments. The results suggest that sulfate reduction could be enhanced when coupled with HC degradation. Phosphorus and iron reduction. As phosphorus is often a limiting factor for oil bioremediation, it is essential to understand phosphorus cycling in marine ecosystems. Genes encoding exopolyphosphatase (ppx) for inorganic polyphosphate degradation and phytase for phytate degradation were detected with significantly (Po0.01 and Po0.05, respectively) increased abundance in plume samples (Supplementary Figure S7). These results suggested that organic phosphorus release could be stimulated by oil contamination. In addition, higher (Po0.1) signal intensities for 61 detected cytochrome c genes were observed in plume samples (Supplementary Figure S8), suggesting that HC degradation coupled with metal reduction could occur in the deep water.
