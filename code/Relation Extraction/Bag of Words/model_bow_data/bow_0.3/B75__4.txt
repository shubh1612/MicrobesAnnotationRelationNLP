Metabolomic investigations of numerous sulfate- and nitrate-reducing cultures utilizing n-alkanes show the formation of two diastereomers of the methylalkylsuccinic acid metabolites (Kropp et al., 2000; Rabus et al., 2001; Wilkes et al., 2002; Cravo-Laureau et al., 2005; Callaghan et al., 2006), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of a sulfate-reducing enrichment culture utilizing ethylcyclopentane resolved up to five peaks corresponding to the requisite ethylcyclopentylsuccinic acids (Rios-Hernandez et al., 2003). Recent stereochemical investigations of ‘Aromatoleum’ HxN1growing on n-hexane showed only the formation of (2R, 1′R) and (2S, 1′R) isomers of 1-methylpentylsucccinate and that the initial step in activation is via abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen from C2 of hexane, with subsequent addition of the alkyl species intermediate to fumarate on the opposite face from which the hydrogen atom was abstracted (Figure 2A; Jarling et al., 2012). It is also proposed that the initial 1-methylpentylsuccinate isomer is epimerized to generate a diastereomer that then undergoes the reported carbon-skeleton rearrangement and subsequent decarboxylation (Jarling et al., 2012). The discoveries of ASS and MAS have enabled the interrogation of hydrocarbon-impacted environments as well as isolates and enrichment cultures (Callaghan et al., 2010; Kolukirik et al., 2011; Andrade et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Mbadinga et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Wawrik et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2013). In addition to alkanes of medium chain lengths, ASS/MAS enzymes appear to play a role in the degradation of very short alkanes (eg., propane) (Kniemeyer et al., 2007; Callaghan et al., 2010; Savage et al., 2010), and recent investigations of anaerobic biodegradation of solid paraffins under methanogenic conditions suggest that microorganisms may also activate paraffin waxes via fumarate addition (Callaghan et al., 2010). With respect to the latter, the detection and expression of several assA genotypes was demonstrated in a methanogenic consortium utilizing octacosane (C28) (Davidova et al., 2011). However, the requisite metabolites have not been identified in this study or in other studies examining alkane activation under methanogenic conditions for which assA genotypes have been detected (Mbadinga et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2012; Aitken et al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2013). It has been hypothesized that either the metabolites that result from fumarate addition do not accumulate to detectable levels under the slow-growing conditions and/or that other mechanisms, such as hydroxylation, may be important (Aitken et al., 2013). Intra-Hydroxylation An “intra-aerobic” pathway of alkane oxidation similar to that of ‘Methylomirabilis oxyfera’ has also been proposed to be involved in the functionalization of n-hexadecane by the Gammaproteobacterium HdN1 (Figure 2B; Zedelius et al., 2011). Unlike ‘Methylomirabilis oxyfera,’ HdN1 contains genes for the complete denitrification pathway. The genome of strain HdN1 does not contain genes that encode an alkane-activating glycyl radical enzyme, but does contain genes that may encode a di-iron monooxygenase, a P450-type monooxygenase and a putative third type of monooxygenase (Zedelius et al., 2011). Consistent with the absence of an alkane-activating glycyl radical enzyme, alkyl-substituted succinates were not detected via metabolite profiling, but 1-hexadecanol was detected when the anaerobic culture was exposed to air. Based on these findings and growth experiments, the authors proposed a mechanism in which NO2-, NO or an unknown product of NO2- reduction may be required for alkane activation. Specifically, the dismutation of NO2- [ΔG°′= -55.2 kJ (mole O2)-1] or NO [ΔG°′= -173.1 kJ (mole O2)-1)] would provide O2, which could then be used to hydroxylate the alkane via one of the putative monooxygenases. Alternatively, N-O species could behave as strongly oxidizing electron acceptors to generate a reactive state of a factor or enzyme site that is involved in the activation of the alkane, or an N-O species may be directly involved in the activation of the alkane (Zedelius et al., 2011). Anaerobic Hydroxylation followed by Carboxylation Finally, there appears to be at least one additional pathway of anaerobic alkane oxidation. Early studies of the sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfococcus oleovorans Hxd3 demonstrated that incubation with an alkane with an odd number of C atoms yielded predominantly fatty acids with an even number of C atoms, and vice versa (Aeckersberg et al., 1998; So et al., 2003). This is in contrast with what is observed in microorganisms that activate alkanes via fumarate addition (So and Young, 1999). Stable isotope studies of strain Hxd3 incubated with NaH13CO3 and [1,2-13C2]hexadecane were indicative of incorporation of carbon derived from bicarbonate at C3 and elimination of the C1 and C2 carbon atoms (So et al., 2003). Subsequently, evidence of this pathway was also observed in nitrate- and sulfate-reducing enrichment cultures utilizing n-hexadecane (Callaghan et al., 2006, 2009). However, although it was hypothesized that carboxylation at C3 may be the first step in degradation, the corresponding carboxylated intermediate, 2-ethylpentadecanoic acid, was not detected in any of the above studies. Under standard conditions, the direct carboxylation of alkanes is an endergonic process (ΔG°′= +28 kJ/mol) (Thauer and Shima, 2008). Thus, carboxylation as the first step in alkane degradation in Hxd3 has been debated for almost 10 years. With the continual evolution of sequencing technologies, however, genome-enabled analyses are yielding new hypotheses. Consistent with the above experimental observations, the genome of Hxd3 does not contain genes encoding an alkane-activating glycyl radical enzyme. Interestingly, the genome contains genes that encode an ethylbenzene dehydrogenase-like complex (Callaghan et al., 2008a), similar to that found in denitrifying strains Aromatoleum aromaticum EbN1 (Kniemeyer and Heider, 2001) and Azoarcus sp. strain EB1 (Johnson and Spormann, 1999; Johnson et al., 2001). Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase is a molybdenum-cofactor-containing enzyme of the dimethylsulfoxide reductase family that catalyzes the anaerobic hydroxylation of ethylbenzene (Ball et al., 1996; Rabus and Heider, 1998). Based on these findings, it is possible that the activation of alkanes by Hxd3 may also occur via anaerobic hydroxylation.
