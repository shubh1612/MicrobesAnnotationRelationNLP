Therefore, it is not appropriate to perform a bioaugmentation process with this microorganism. The results of this work allow to conclude that the tested native soil microflora (system 1) and the treatment system constituted of B. cepacia, P. alcaligenes and P. putida inoculum (system 13), after addition of NH4NO3 in the concentration of 30 Âµmol/g of soil and 0,1 mM of H2O2, presented high potential to degrade gasoline in treatments after leakage into soils. It is important to emphasize that for an in-situ treatment a detailed evaluation of the microbial population available locally and the required nutrients is necessary, as well as the treatment time necessary for an efficient remediation technology.
