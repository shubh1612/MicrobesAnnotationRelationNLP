A diesel-degrading bacterium (strain IU5) isolated from oil-contaminated soil was characterized in this study. Fatty acid and 16s rDNA sequence analysis identified IU5 as a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and growth curve experiments identified the bacterium’s optimum conditions as pH 7 and P. aeruginosa IU5 degraded up to 60% of applied diesel (8500 mg/kg) over 13 days in a soil-slurry phase. In addition, this strain was able to grow on many other petroleum hydrocarbons as sole carbon sources, including crude oil, gasoline, benzene, toluene, xylene, and even PAHs such as naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene. Therefore, P. aeruginosa IU5 may be useful for bioremediation of soils and groundwater contaminated with a variety of hydrocarbons. Diesel contains many highly concentrated toxic materials (Dillard et al. 1997; Gold-Bouchot et al. 1997), and diesel contamination can negatively influence soil microbes and plants, as well as contaminate groundwater, which may be used for drinking or agriculture. Because of this, a variety of methods have been developed to treat diesel contamination. While many of the established physical and chemical methods are efficient, they are also expensive and can cause recontamination by secondary contaminants. Bioremediation is the microbial degradation of organic pollutants such as petroleum in soil and groundwater. This technique has the benefits of high treatment efficiency, low cost, relatively quick action, in site and ex site application, and compatibility with other techniques. Nevertheless, the application of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in oil-contaminated sites does not guarantee to remove all components of crude oil because some components still remain difficult to degrade, such as alkanes of shorter and longer chains (<C10 and C20–C40) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Yuste et al. 2000). So it is meaningful to find a new bacterial strain that can metabolize a broad range of the hydrocarbons contained in crude oil, especially the highly persistent components. Thus, since the discovery of new strain(s) and the finding of optimum conditions of diesel-degrading bacteria for the enhancement of microbial activity are vital to economically and effectively amelionating contaminated soils and groundwater, here we sought to isolate a diesel-degrading bacterium and examine its characteristics and abilities to degrade diesel and other petroleum hydrocarbons. Isolation of diesel-degrading bacteria This study used crude oil-contaminated soils as inocula for isolating diesel-degrading bacteria. Contaminated soil samples were collected from sites near a gas station in Incheon, Korea, and a gas station in Ulsan, Korea. For culture enrichment, we added 10 g contaminated soil and 2 ml diesel (v/v, 1%) in 200 ml Bushnell Haas (BH) medium. Samples were cultivated at 30 C and 180 rev/min for 7 days, and the inoculum culture (5%, v/v) was transferred into 1% (v/v) diesel-added BH medium. Nine microbial strains (IU1, IU2, IU3, IU4, IU5, IU6, U1, U2 and U3) were distinguished based on morphological differences among the colonies on LB plates. IU5 was finally selected as the most active strain World Journal of Microbiology & Biotechnology (2005) 21: 381–384 Springer 2005 DOI 10.1007/s11274-004-3630-1 for diesel-degradation based on the relative activity (Figure 1). Fatty acid and 16s rDNA analyses were performed to identify the isolated strain IU5. First, IU5 was phenotypically characterized by fatty acid methyl ester content (FAME) analysis using gas chromatography (Thompson et al. 1993), with the results analysed using a MIDI system (Kim et al. 2003). For the 16s rDNA analysis, genomic DNA was extracted with the alkaline lysis method, and 16s rDNA was amplified in PCR using the genomic DNA as template and bacterial universal primers, 341f (5¢-CCT ACG GGA GGC AGC AG-3¢) and 907r (5¢-CCC CGT CAA TTC ATT TGA GTT-3¢). The PCR reactions contained 1 ll template, 2.5 ll 10·Buffer, 0.5 lg/ll BAS, 200 lM dNTP mixture, 20 pmol primers (each), and 0.5 U/ll Taq polymerase (total volume: 25 ll). The reactions were preheated at 95 C for 5 min, followed by 16 cycles of 95 C for 1 min, annealing for 1 min (starting at 63 C and decreasing 1 C every second cycle), and 72 C for 1 min. This was followed by 14 cycles of 95 C for 1 min, 55 C for 1 min and 72 C for 1 min, with an additional 5 min at 72 C as a final extension step.
