Addition of oxygen, or oxygen-yielding compounds, would accelerate biodegradation, but is extremely expensive to engineer owing to inter alia poor solubility. Supplementation with highly soluble nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor could be considered owing to the presence of typical denitrifying organisms in some groundwater samples, but on its own may upset any oxygen-nitrate balance required for efficient benzene degradation. It is also clear that a pH of about 12 is incompatible with benzene biodegradation, and so in order to remediate groundwater in the local vicinity of the alkaline well neutralization would first be required.
