The a13C of methane from these sediments (−42.3 to −51.0 PDB) shows a wider range than the vent gas (−44.1 and −46.0 PDB) ( Table 1 ; Table 2). Some methane is depleted in 13C relative to vent gas by as much as 6.9 PDB, indicating an in situ component of methane other than from thermogenic venting. Some sediment samples contain both thermogenic vent methane and bacterial methane. Our limited isotopic data do not allow distinction between pathways involving reduction of CO2 or acetate fermentation (Coleman et al., 1996). However, the GC 233 brine pool emphasizes the volumetric importance of bacterial methane production in our Green Canyon study area (Table 2). In addition, bacterial methane gas hydrates are well documented in the study area (Brooks et al., 1986). The mixed methane pool in Bush Hill sediments has been subject to extensive bacterial oxidation. Methane from hydrate-mound sediments is strongly enriched in D (−134 to −158 SMOW) relative to associated vent gas (−198 to −200 SMOW), by as much as 66 (Table 1 ; Table 2). We could expect to observe enrichment of 13C in residual methane of sediments based on strong enrichment of D in the methane samples. However, this is not observed because of mixing with bacterial gas strongly depleted in 13C. Measurements of a13C suggest preferential bacterial oxidation of specific C2+ hydrate-forming molecules in sediments. This alteration is not observed in associated gas hydrates. Although C2 is not greatly affected, C3 in hydrate-associated sediments (−24.7 to −20.3 PDB) is enriched in 13C relative to vent gases (−25.0 to −26.3 PDB) by as much as 6.0 ( Table 1 ; Table 2). Although i-C4 is not greatly affected, n-C4 in hydrate associated sediments (−19.6 to −21.5 PDB) is enriched in 13C relative to vent gases (−22.6 to −23.3 PDB) by as much as 3.7 ( Table 1 ; Table 2). These kinetic isotope effects are consistent with preferential bacterial oxidation of straight-chain hydrocarbons (such as C3 and n-C4) in the geologic environment (Winters and Williams, 1969; James and Burns, 1984), and in laboratory simulations (Stahl, 1980). CO2 of hydrate-mound sediments is depleted in 13C relative to thermogenic vent gas by as much as 16.4 (Table 1 ; Table 2). Closed-system oxidation of hydrate-bound methane could result in greater 13C depletion of hydrate-bound CO2 than observed here (Barker and Fritz, 1981; Alperin et al., 1988). However, the CO2 is likely a mixture of thermogenic vent-gas CO2 and bacterially-derived CO2 (Sassen et al., 1998). Our data are consistent with a net production of CO2 from bacterial hydrocarbon oxidation in a complex natural system. A sample of hydrate-associated sediment from GC 234 (C1–C5=138,864 ppm) shows a similar pattern of bacterial hydrocarbon oxidation and net CO2 production (Table 2). The a13C of methane is similar to vent gas. However, relative to vent gas from the same site (−203 SMOW), sediment methane is enriched in D (−121 SMOW) by 82 ( Table 1 ; Table 2). The C3 and n-C4 hydrocarbons are enriched in 13C, being consistent with the kinetic isotope effects of bacterial oxidation (see Table 2). Relative to vent gas, CO2 is depleted in 13C by 31.2 ( Table 1 ; Table 2). 4.5. Hydrocarbon alteration in tube worm sediments Concentrations of C1–C5 hydrocarbons from three core samples of tube worm sediment from GC 234 are in the 12,960 to 75,249 ppm range, and methane comprises 73.3–85.2% of the total (Table 2 and Fig. 8). Relative to methane of vent gas from the same site (−48.7 PDB), tube worm sediments (−53.1 to −54.2 PDB) are depleted in 13C by as much as 5.5 (Table 1 ; Table 2). The depletion in 13C of methane is consistent with production of bacterial methane in sediments.
