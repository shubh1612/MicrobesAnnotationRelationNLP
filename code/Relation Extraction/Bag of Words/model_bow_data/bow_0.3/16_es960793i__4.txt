The calibration standard used in the TPH-IR method was 25% (v/v) n-hexadecane, 37.5% (v/v) isooctane, and 37.5% (v/v) chlorobenzene; absorption was measured in the IR spectral range of 3400−3500 cm-1. (B) Aromatic Hydrocarbons. Polyaromatic compounds (two-, three-, and four-ring PAH) were extracted using sonication and methylene chloride from 2 g of soil according to EPA Method 3550 and analyzed by a direct injection GC/MS determination based on EPA Method 8270 (47). Volatile organics such as BTEX were determined using a modification of Method 8240 (47) by extracting (vortex mixing) 10 g of soil with 10 mL of high-purity methanol and then analyzed by GC/MS. (C) TCLP Organics and Metals. The extraction procedures (Method 1331) for organics (Methods 8240 and 8270) and metals (Methods 6010 and 7470) were described in the SW-846 manual (48) and performed by Chester Laboratories, Houston, TX. Total fixed metals in soil were determined by Methods 6010 and 7471 as given in SW-846. (D) Group-Type Separation Analysis. In the analysis of the saturate, aromatic, and polar fractions of the whole oils, TPH extracts were dried and redissolved in cyclopentane and separated on a packed silica gel glass column. The saturates, aromatics, and polar fractions were eluted with pentane, pentane−benzene (60:40), and benzene−2-propanol (80:20), respectively. The dry weight of each fraction was obtained by evaporating the solvent at 60 °C and weighing the residue. (E) Hydrocarbon Distribution by “Simulated Boiling Point” Gas Chromatography. A gas chromatographic simulated high-temperature distillation of hydrocarbons by carbon number was performed on methylene chloride extracts of the untreated and bioremediated oily soils using a modifica tion of ASTM Method D-2887 (49, 50). Hydrocarbon fractions (saturates and aromatics) from C11−C44 were separated, and a standard normal paraffin mixture was used for matching retention time with carbon number in the temperature-programmed column distillation. Leaching Potential. The ready desorption and dissolution of water-soluble hydrocarbons and metals from each oily soil before and after bioremediation was determined by batch and column extraction methods. In the batch test, 20 g of soil was sequentially extracted five times with 200-mL aliquots of 0.01 M CaSO4−2% sodium azide solution on a rotary platform agitator at 20 rpm for 24−48-h intervals. Sodium azide was added to the CaSO4 solution to prevent microbial growth and biodegradation of the soluble hydrocarbons released from the soil. Soil slurries were centrifuged (2000 rpm, 45 min), and the combined supernatants were analyzed for O&G, TPH, BTEX, and metals (e.g., V, Ni, and Cu). These batch extraction methods were modified from the California Waste Extraction Test Procedures (51). In the column leaching studies, 500 g of soil was packed into a 2 in. × 6 in. glass column between 0.5 in. layers of Ottawa sand (Mallinckrodt Chem. Co.; 95% of the particles pass a no. 50 sieve). Columns were operated in an upflow direction using a syringe pulse pump flowing 2 pore vol/day of 0.01 M CaSO4−2% sodium azide solution. These conditions simulated a water leaching flow rate through soil of 1 ft/day. Column leachates were also analyzed for O&G, TPH, BTEX, and metals.
