Distinctive trends were observed in the average signal intensities of genes related specifically to hydrocarbon degradation in Inlet (Figure 7) and Marsh (Figure 8) sediments. Genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation increased in relative abundance between June and July in Inlet sediments but decreased in Marsh sediments. Genes known to degrade alkanes, cycloalkanes, aromatic carboxylic acids, chlorinated aromatics, polycyclic aromatics, and other aromatics decreased significantly (p<0.01 and p<0.05) in Marsh samples between June and July during the time oil concentrations were decreasing in Marsh sediments. In contrast, genes related to hydrocarbon degradation increased in signal intensities between June and July in Inlet sediments though not significantly (p>0.05). Discussion Salt marshes ecosystems are highly productive and biologically rich environments that are sensitive to anthropogenic contamination such as oil spills [36], [37]. The overall impact to the system depends on the amount and type of oil, physical aspects of the marsh, and temperature. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill occurred approximately 77 km offshore during the late spring and by the time the oil reached the Alabama coast [6] in the early summer it presented primarily as weathered tar balls and/or mousse collecting within salt marsh sediments and along the shore. We detected oil in the Point Aux Pins salt marsh sediments in June 2010 that persisted through our samplings in September 2010. The amount of oil that affected the Alabama marsh was heterogeneously distributed and did not saturate the sediments as was observed in areas of coastal Louisiana [38]. Oil saturated sediments can form “pavements” that sink into the subsurface [39]. These reduced water-oil interfaces effectively preserve oil from microbial biodegradation and can remain sequestered for years. Analysis of sediment cores collected one year after the arrival of oil in the Point Aux Pins salt marsh detected no TPH within the top 30 cm of sediments (data not shown). The absence of “pavements” within this depth profile suggests that the heterogeneity and amount of oil in the sediment did not appear to favor oil preservation and may have been a key factor that contributed to the efficient removal of oil from these marsh sediments possibly by natural attenuation. The relative distribution of the predominant bacterial phyla detected was approximately 7% Bacteroidetes; 11% Actinobacteria; 16% Firmicutes; and 46% Proteobacteria (Table 3). Dominance of Proteobacteria is consistent with the phylogenetic diversity observed in other estuarine salt marshes [43], [44], [45] and a Florida sandy beach impacted by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill [23]. Both the relative abundance and number of OTUs of bacterial phyla increased during oiling, suggesting that not only did the relative community richness increase in response to the hydrocarbon input, but the relative intensities of those populations already at detectable levels responded as well. Members of hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial families that demonstrated the largest increases in relative abundance between June and July during the oiling of sediments were Actinomycetaceae, Dietziaceae, Nocardioidaceae, Rhizobiaceae, Xanthobacteraceae, Erythrobacteraceae, and Aeromonadaceae. Members of these families have been shown to degrade alkanes [46] and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [47], [48], [49], [50]. Interestingly, several hydrocarbon-degraders detected in the salt marsh, such as Aeromonadaceae, Bacillaceae, Pseudomonadales, and Shewanellaceae, are also known to form biofilms and/or produce biosurfactants [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56] that can enhance oil degradation through gene transfer and oil emulsification [54], [57], [58]. Ordination of the bacterial community based on relative abundance revealed distinctive differences between groups of samples based primarily on month during the oil inundation (Figure 4). Increases in relative abundance of known hydrocarbon degraders, such as Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria, between June and July when oil concentrations were highest and subsequent decreases in September when concentrations were lower suggest a rapid microbial response to oil concentrations. In contrast, both Bacilli and Clostridia demonstrated significant increases in relative abundance in September. Classes of known hydrocarbon-degrading Firmicutes steadily increased in all samples between June and September even after oil was no longer detected in contrast to other hydrocarbon degraders that immediately declined when the oil was undetectable. Community enrichment of Firmicutes in salt marsh sediments has also been observed in response to hydrocarbon contamination in a simulated spill study [59] and may be used as an indicator of the later stages of hydrocarbon degradation when more recalcitrant compounds such as PAHs are present [23]. The function of the microbial community in salt marsh sediments also changed during the time of oiling. The overall microbial community functional structure was significantly (p<0.01) different between Marsh and Inlet sediments during the months of June and July when TPH concentrations were increasing in the Inlet and decreasing in the Marsh. While total functional gene relative abundances increased (12.7%) in Inlet samples between June and July in correlation with a 44% increase in total TPH, genes significantly (p<0.05) decreased by 25.2% in Marsh sediments where total TPH decreased by 36% in July compared to June (Figure 6; Table 2). This positive relationship between gene abundance, particularly hydrocarbon-degrading genes, and TPH suggests that community function was driven by oil concentrations. This association is further supported by an associated decrease in relative abundance of known hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, specifically members of Alteromonadaceae, Colwelliaceae, and Shewanellaceae, between June and July in Marsh sediments.
