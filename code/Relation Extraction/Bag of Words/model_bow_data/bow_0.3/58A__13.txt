The simplest aromatic amine, aniline, accumulates in stoichiometric yields when anaerobic microbial communities are supplied with azobenzene (Weber & Wolfe 1987) or nitrobenzene (Dickel et al. 1993). This is not surprising since aniline has consistently been found to be completely recalcitrant in methanogenic consortia (Battersby & Wilson 1989; De et al. 1994; Schink 1988b). There is however, evidence for aniline biodegradation by sulfate reducing bacteria (Schink 1988b) and in mixed cultures under denitrilying conditions (De et al. 1994). Aniline degradation by a methanogenic consortium has also been claimed (Schink 1991). Aromatic amines with carboxy, hydroxy and methoxy substitutions are potentially mineralizable in methanogenic consortia. Biodegradability tests of these compounds in anaerobic sludge indicate that 2- and 4-aminophenol are sometimes mineralized (Battersby & Wilson 1989; O'Connor& Young 1993) and other times are left unmetabolized (Battersby & Wilson 1989; O'Connor & Young 1993). Both anthranilate (2-aminobenzoate) and 4-aminobenzoate are reliably mineralized (Bollag & Kaiser 1991; Horowitz et al. 1981; Schink 1988b; Shelton & Tiedje 1984), but there are mixed reports on the biodegradability of 3-aminobenzoate (Battersby & Wilson 1989; Horowitz et al. 1981). The elimination of 4,4'- diamino-3,3'-dimethoxybiphenyl was also reported in anaerobic sludge (Brown & Hamburger 1987). Nitroor chloroanilines may be subject to anaerobic biotransformations involving reduction of the electrophilic groups (Gorontzy et al. 1993; McCormick et al. 1976; Struijs & Rogers 1989). Finally, a number of Nsubstituted aromatics having a structure similar to the naturally occurring amino acid, tryptophan, such as indole, indolyl-acetate, pyridine, dipicolinate, quinoline and isoquinoline are also often found to be biodegraded under anaerobic conditions (Bollag & Kaiser 1991; Grbic-Galic 1990; Schink 1988b). Lack of oxygenated functional groups Aerobes. The lack of oxygen containing functional groups is not a problem for aerobes which possess oxygenases that can easily incorporate oxygen into the molecule (Smith 1994). Simple aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, naphthalene and biphenyl are consistently degraded in aerobic microbial communities in sludge, soil and sediments (Bosma et al. 1994; Malaney 1960; Mihelcic & Luthy 1988a; Okey & Bogan 1965). The recalcitrant behaviour of complex aromatic hydrocarbons of four or more rings can mostly attributed to their low bioavailability, rather than an intrinsic limitation in the biodegradative capacity of oxygenases. Anaerobes. The lack of polar functional groups on aromatic hydrocarbons was initially associated with recalcitrance in anaerobic environments. This belief was based on frequent observations that simple aromatic hydrocarbons were not degraded in methanogenic sludge and methanogenic sediments (Battersby & Wilson 1989; Bosma et al. 1994; Horowitz et al. 1981; Mihelcic & Luthy 1988a; Schink 1985). However, this view must now be modified since several reports have documented slow toluene and o-xylene biodegradation in enrichment cultures derived from both methanogenic (Edwards & Grbic-Galic 1994; Grbic-Galic 1990; Vogel & Grbic-Galic 1986) and sulfate reducing aquifer sediments (Beller et al. 1992; Edwards et al.
