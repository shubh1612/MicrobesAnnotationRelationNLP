To examine the functions of these putative phenol hydroxylase genes, each DNA region containing the phenol hydroxylase and EDO genes was subcloned into pUC18. JM109 cells, separately carrying each of the 17 resulting plasmids, produced a yellow product on LB agar in the presence of catechol (Table 3), confirming catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activities. In addition, 12 of the 17 clones produced 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (yellow) on LB agar plates containing phenol. These active clones contain the genes for functional single-component phenol hydroxylases. Frame-shift (2C1, 4E12), nonsense (2A1), or substitution (2B9, 5B2) mutations in the remaining, inactive genes might have caused the loss or alteration of enzymatic activity (Table 3). Fosmids carrying the I.2.G EDO genes were characterized by a relative abundance in mobile genetic elements and their remnants. It is also noteworthy that the transposase genes for ISPme1 (in 1D9 to 7B2; see below section ‘Reconstitution of a plasmid-like circular DNA from fosmid sequences carrying I.2.G EDO genes’) and an ISSop9-related element (ORF2B9-5, ORF2A1-27 and ORF2C1-24) were located very close to the single-component phenol hydroxylase genes (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S3). The fosmid 3G3 contains at least 10 genes predicted to be involved in the type IV conjugative transfer system: the gene for the coupling protein (TraG) and for the mating-pair formation apparatus (Trb) (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S3). The organization of these genes (trbBCDEJLFGI) in 3G3 resembles that found in the Tn4371 genomic island (Toussaint et al., 2003) rather than that found in self-transmissible plasmids (Schröder and Lanka, 2005). These genes exhibit ~60% identity to those of typical Tn4371-type genomic islands (Toussaint et al., 2003) and much higher (~90%) identities to those found on the second chromosome of the α-proteobacterial strain Ochrobactrum anthropi ATCC 49188. Therefore, the transfer-related gene cluster in 3G3 appears to be part of a variant Tn4371-type genomic island in which several α-proteobacterial genomes also reside. The deduced gene products of ORF2A1-17, −16 and −15 share 96%, 89% and 44% identity, respectively, with the replication proteins RepA (ZP_01441940), RepB (ZP_01441941) and RepC (ZP_01038470) of Roseovarius sp. strains HTCC2601 (RepA and B) and 217 (RepC). This type of repABC operon controls stable replication and partitioning of large and low-copy-number plasmids and has been found only in α-Proteobacteria (Cevallos et al., 2008). Therefore, the 2A1 insert appears to originate from an α-proteobacterial plasmid, consistent with the result of SOM analysis. Reconstitution of a plasmid-like circular DNA from fosmid sequences carrying I.2.G EDO genes The fosmid fragments in 1D9, 1D2, 9B9, 3H5, 1H11 and 6D4 had overlapping sequences that were assembled into a 36 684-bp circular DNA form (Figure 6). This circular DNA, designated pSKYE1, contained a total of 34 ORFs and was considered to be a plasmid because of the observations described below. The circular DNA pSKYE1 carries several genes related to plasmid replication (ORF1D9-5), partition (ORF1D9-12, and −29), and conjugation (ORF1D9-1, −14 and −31). The deduced gene product of ORF1D9-5 is 82% identical to RepA of plasmid pAMI2 of Paracoccus aminophilus JCM 7686, which has a replication system that is functional in several α-proteobacterial genera, such as Paracoccus, Rhizobium, Rhodobacter and Agrobacterium (Dziewit et al., 2007). Therefore, replication of pSKYE1 might be possible in α-proteobacterial strains. The repA gene of pAMI2 is followed by a so-called PAR module, which is responsible for the active partitioning function of the plasmid (Dziewit et al., 2007). Furthermore, pSKYE1 carries two putative partition gene modules (ORF1D9-12 and −13 and ORF1D2-29 and −30). The deduced gene products lack homology to the PAR modules in pAMI2. However, the deduced ORF1D9-12 and −13 gene products are 66% and 44% identical to the corresponding gene products encoded by Laribacter hongkongensis plasmid pHLHK22, and the deduced ORF1D2-29 and ORF1D9-30 gene products are 44% and 29% identical to the corresponding proteins encoded by a large plasmid from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A. The deduced products of ORF1D9-1 and −14 are 70% and 87% identical to the C-terminal regions of the conjugative transfer TraG proteins of plasmid Ti from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (NP_059692) and plasmid pAgK84 from A. tumefaciens K84 (YP_086775), respectively, and the deduced ORF1D9-31 product is 51% identical to an intact conjugal transfer anti-restriction protein of Nitrobacter hamburgenis X14 (YP_575924). An IS element and transposon were found in pSKYE1; their putative terminal inverted-repeat (IR) sequences are shown in Supplementary Figure S4. The former mobile genetic element flanked by 50-bp IR sequences is located very close to the single-component phenol hydroxylase gene and was thought to be ISPme1, an IS element from plasmid pMTH1 of Paracoccus methylutens DM12 (Bartosik et al., 2008). The latter element, designated Tn6032, has 25-bp IR sequences and carries three ORFs encoding polypeptides with moderate sequence identity to TniA (40%), TniB (35%) and an N-terminal portion of TniQ (23%) of Tn5053 from Xanthomonas sp.
