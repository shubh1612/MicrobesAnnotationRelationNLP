Analysis of the sequences obtained was performed with the ALIGN-SEQUENCE algorithm from the National Science Foundation Ribosomal Database Project (20). In initial experiments, we used PLFA analysis to detect changes in soil microbial populations in response to toluene additions. As toluene disappeared from Yolo silt loam (initial concentrations ranged from 10 to 100 μg of toluene ml of soil solution−1 or 35 to 350 μg g of dry soil−1), a subset of 10 PLFA were enriched. These fatty acids were 14:0, 15:1* (* denotes an unknown double-bond location), 15:0, 16:1ω6, 17:1ω8, 17:0, 10me17:0, i18:0, 10me18:0, and 10me19:0. Fatty acids 15:1*, i18:0, and 10me19:0 were detected only in microcosms that received the highest concentration (100 μg ml−1) of toluene. The concentrations of the remaining seven PLFA were strongly correlated with the initial toluene concentration, as shown in Fig. 1. The sum of mass increases in these 10 PLFA after incubation with 100 μg of toluene ml−1 was equivalent to 14.4% of the total soil PLFA pool, suggesting that toluene-degrading populations represented a large component of the microbial community after incubation with toluene. A small subset of soil PLFA decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after exposure to 100 μg of toluene ml−1 (Table 1). The 18:2ω6,9 fatty acid is commonly considered a biomarker for eukaryotic organisms (14), while the 16:1ω11c, 16:1ω5c, iso 17:1*, and cyclopropyl 19:0 fatty acids are widely distributed among soil bacterial groups (28). To directly measure the flow of carbon from toluene into microbial populations responsible for biodegradation, we incubated Yolo silt loam with 35 μg of ring-labeled [13C]toluene ml−1 and analyzed the community PLFA patterns. Toluene amendment resulted in a striking 13C enrichment of a small subset of the soil PLFA (Fig. 2A and B). The [13C]toluene results contrasted with a similar incubation of Yolo silt loam with [13C]glucose, an easily metabolized carbon substrate, in which most of the soil PLFA detected were highly enriched in 13C (Fig.3). In the [13C]glucose incubation, 39 of a total of 43 PLFA were highly labeled (with >3 atom% 13C). In contrast, in the [13C]toluene incubation, 96% of 13C detected in all PLFA (59 fatty acids) was contained in 16 highly labeled fatty acids (Fig. 2B and C). When subsamples of Yolo silt loam that had been enriched with toluene were plated onto 0.1× TSA, only gram-positive cells with a single colony morphology, a buff-colored irregular form, were found to metabolize toluene. This result was observed for three independent enrichments. This same colony morphology was the sole morphotype on TSA plates spread with solutions obtained from the most dilute most probable number (MPN) bottles (22) of toluene degraders in Yolo silt loam (data not shown). Whole-cell fatty acid analysis of selected colonies from both soil enrichments and MPN bottles yielded FAME profiles most similar to high-G+C-content, gram-positive nocardioform actinomycetes. One isolate, designated strain YT-2, from the toluene enrichment of Yolo silt loam was chosen for further phylogenetic analysis. Whole-cell fatty acid analysis of strain YT-2 yielded a FAME profile that was 35% similar to that of a Gordona sp. (formerly designated Rhodococcus). The small-subunit rDNA sequence of strain YT-2 was 88% similar to that of a Rhodococcus sp. Interestingly, those soil PLFA which increased in mass during the toluene incubations (Fig. 1) closely matched the PLFA found in strain YT-2 when it was grown on toluene. Thus, 97.9% of the mass increase in PLFA enriched in soil during incubation with toluene (100 μg ml−1) was associated with the same PLFAs that are contained in strain YT-2. As in our initial soil incubations with unlabeled toluene, enriched fatty acids in [13C] toluene incubations matched those found in strain YT-2.
