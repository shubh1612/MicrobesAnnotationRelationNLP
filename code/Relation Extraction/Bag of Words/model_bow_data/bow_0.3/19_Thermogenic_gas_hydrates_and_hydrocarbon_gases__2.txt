Geologic and geochemical setting Our Green Canyon study area is part of a large belt spanning the Gulf of Mexico slope (Fig. 1) that contains sea-floor gas vents, oil seeps, gas hydrates, chemosynthetic communities, and subsurface oil and gas fields (Roberts and Aharon, 1994; Sassen et al., 1994 ; MacDonald et al., 1996). The most recent episode of hydrocarbon venting appears to have initiated across Green Canyon during the late Pleistocene (Aharon et al., 1997). Geochemical correlation of oil and gas from our Green Canyon study areas offshore Louisiana establishes a link to a deeply buried Mesozoic hydrocarbon system (6–10 km) that gave rise to shallower (2–3 km) oil and gas accumulations (Kennicutt et al., 1988). Vertical migration of fluids in Green Canyon is facilitated by actively moving salt bodies and faults, resulting in rapid fluid flow and venting on the sea floor. The Bush Hill study site is a fault-related seep feature in Green Canyon (GC) Block 185 (27°47.5′ N and 91°30.5′ W) at about 540 m water depth (Fig. 1). The faults are related to the subsurface hydrocarbon system that gave rise to nearby Jolliet Field on GC 184 (Reilly et al., 1996). Mean sea-bottom water temperature is ∼7°C (MacDonald et al., 1994), and the pressure is ∼5400 kPa. Copious streams of thermogenic gas vent continuously to the water column at Bush Hill (MacDonald et al., 1994 ; Sassen and MacDonald, 1997). Sea-floor mounds, ∼1–3 m across, have gas hydrate outcropping on their flanks. Gas hydrate appears to rapidly crystallize during venting as vein fillings within hemipelagic mud. Vein-filling gas hydrate is typical in settings with rapid fluid flow (Ginsburg and Soloviev, 1994 ; Ginsburg, 1998). Gas hydrate mounds at Bush Hill have persisted at the same locations for >5 years (MacDonald et al., 1994), and are thus likely to be impacted by exposure at the sea floor. Thin layers of hemipelagic mud (∼10–30 cm) cap hydrate mounds at Bush Hill. Sediments are typically bioturbated by macro-fauna and contain aromatic-rich bacterially oxidized crude oil, free gas, dispersed gas hydrate nodules, authigenic carbonate rock, H2S, pyrite, and elemental sulfur (Sassen et al., 1993 ; Sassen et al., 1994). Authigenic carbonate depleted in 13C occurs as linings of tubular polychaete burrows which extend down to the gas hydrate surface (Sassen et al., 1998). A complex chemosynthetic community inhabits the Bush Hill site (MacDonald et al., 1989). Specifically, white or orange Beggiatoa mats ( Larkin et al., 1994) occupy the sediment–water interface on gas hydrate mounds; vestimentiferan tube worms (mainly Lamellibrachia n. sp.) are adjacent to the mounds ( Fig. 2). The GC 234 study site (27°44.8′ N and 91°13.3′ W) is a fault-related seep area over shallow salt (Reilly et al., 1996) at ∼543 m water depth (Fig. 1). Mean temperatures and pressures are similar to those observed at the Bush Hill site. Gas hydrate vein-fillings outcropped on an upthrown fault scarp. When sampled in 1997, the gas hydrate was decomposing, as evidenced by continuous formation and release of free gas bubbles from its surface. Gas hydrate instability resulted in undercutting of the scarp face, and by 1998 the feature was absent. We assume the GC 234 gas hydrate was more recently exposed than gas hydrate at the Bush Hill site, and was a transient feature.
