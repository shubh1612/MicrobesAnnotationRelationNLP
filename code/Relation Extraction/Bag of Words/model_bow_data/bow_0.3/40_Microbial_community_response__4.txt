Soil pH (free acidity) was measured in H2O (soil to water ratio 1:2.5 w/w) after shaking for 1 h. All soil samples were ground, mineralized by the method of Kjeldahl and analyzed colorimetrically for total nitrogen (Ntot) and phosphorus (Ptot) on a Technicon Autoanalyzer II (Dublin, Ireland). Total soil carbon was combusted at 1000 °C to CO2 which was analyzed on a CASUMAT analyzer (Wöstmann, Bochum, Germany). The CO2 release from soil boiled in 33% phosphoric acid was measured in order to get the total inorganic carbon content and the total organic carbon (TOC) content was calculated by subtracting the inorganic carbon content, from the total carbon content. The temperature profiles in the soil were measured on selected days at 4 p.m. with buried thermometers. Missing values were interpolated from the closest measurements. Water content was measured by weight loss due to evaporation after 24 h at 105 °C. For enumeration of total bacteria, the <2 mm sieved fraction of 0.3 g of each soil sample was suspended in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (0.13 M NaCl, 7 mM Na2HPO4 and 3 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.2) and stored in 96% EtOH at −20 °C [14]. The suspensions were then diluted between two- and tenfold (depending on cell density) in pyrophosphate buffer (0.1% Na4P2O7× 10 H2O), and ultrasonicated to disrupt biofilms and permeabilize cell membranes. Three times 20 μl of the dispersed suspension were spotted on gelatin-coated slides dried on heating plates at 70 °C and finally dehydrated sequentially in 50%, 80% and 96% ethanol for 3 min each. The dry samples were stained for 10 min with an aqueous mixture of 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI, 5 μg ml−1) and acridine orange (AO, 0.001%), dried again, covered with a drop of citifluor AF1 (Citifluor Ltd., London, UK) and a cover slip and stored at −20 °C. Bacteria were counted with a microscope (Olympus BX-60, Olympus Optical Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) equipped for epifluorescence. Staining with a DAPI/AO mixture allowed easy distinction between orange-stained soil particles and blue-stained bacteria. Cell counts are average cell numbers of 16 equally distributed fields on a microscope slide. Averages and standard deviations presented in Fig. 3 were calculated from three of these measurements based on 16 fields. Protein was quantified in order to test the correlation between total cell numbers and microbial biomass. To prepare 1 l of Bradford Reagent, 100 mg of Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 was dissolved in 50 ml ethanol (96%). Deionized, filtered H2O and 100 ml H3PO4 (85%) were added to give a volume of 1000 ml. Protein standards in the range of 0.5–0.005 mg ml−1 were prepared from a stock solution of 1 mg bovine serum albumin (BSA) per ml. Sieving soil samples (<2 mm) allowed to separate roots and worms from the soil before protein analysis. One ml of 1 M NaOH was added to 1.5 g sample soil and cooked for 10 min at 95 °C [14]. The soil particles were subsequently settled by centrifugation (5 min at 4000 rpm). After chilling, 0.5 ml of the supernatant was neutralized by addition of 1 M HCl (sterile, filtered) in a new tube. The OD590 was measured after incubation for 5 min with Bradford reagent. Particles and dissolved material were accounted for by a blank for each sample. Since the pH was lowered to 1 by addition of the Bradford reagent to the sample, some soil material was dissolved. To have the same conditions in the blank and in the sample, a solution prepared identically to Bradford reagent without Coomassie brilliant blue was added. Microorganisms for physiological profiles were extracted by shaking 30 g soil for 30 min in 75 ml sterile deionized water at 180 rpm on a rotary shaker. Deionized water was chosen since, according to the DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek) theory of colloid stability, low ion concentration favors detachment of particles from surfaces [31].
