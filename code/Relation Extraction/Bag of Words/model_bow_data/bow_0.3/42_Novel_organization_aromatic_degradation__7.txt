Furthermore, a conserved target site (5′-TTTTCAT-3′) for Tn4371 insertion was found in the intergenic region between the rplM and int genes, which might constitute one end of the Tn4371-like genomic islands. Therefore, the 22-kb region downstream of rplM is likely to be part of a Tn4371-like genomic island that contains the aph operon. We recently proposed the I.1.C and I.3.M EDO subfamilies on the basis of their novel amino acid sequences (Suenaga et al., 2007). A DNA fragment containing the I.1.C EDO gene was found in both fosmids 4A3 and 6B9, and a fragment containing the I.3.M EDO gene was found in both 7E11 and 8C3 (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S2). Strikingly, degradation genes other than these EDO genes were not identified in the fosmid inserts. ORF7E11-1, −2 and −3 appear to constitute an operon with the I.3.M EDO gene (ORF7E11-4). The former three genes were annotated as the genes for a hypothetical protein, hydantoin racemase and fumarate reductase flavoprotein subunit, respectively, but functions of these ORFs for the degradation of aromatic compounds remain unclear. Although there are some examples of functionally related catabolic genes being dispersed on chromosomes and plasmids (for example, Rhodococcus spp. and sphingomonads) (van der Geize and Dijkhuizen, 2004; Basta et al., 2005), the ‘solitary’-type gene structure identified in these fosmids has not previously been documented. The EDO (ORF1F2-17 product) encoded by fosmid 1F2 belongs to the novel subfamily I.3.N (Suenaga et al., 2007). Sixteen genes (ORF1F2-3 to −7 and −16 to −26) in the fosmid were categorized as involved in aromatics degradation (Figures 1 and 4). Of these 16 genes, nine (ORF1F2-7, −16, −17, −20, −21, −23 to −26) encoded products predicted to have 27–53% amino acid sequence identity with those of the enzymes for naphthalene degradation encoded by the nah genes of plasmid NAH7 from P. putida G7 (Sota et al., 2006a) and the nag genes of Ralstonia sp. U2 (Zhou et al., 2001). However, these 16 genes are apparently not sufficient to constitute a complete pathway for naphthalene degradation (Figure 4). Although the EDO sequence of ORF1F2-17 is only 19% identical to that of NAH7-encoded NahH (catechol 2,3-dioxygenase), the ORF1F2-17 gene product actually cleaves catechol at the meta-position (Suenaga et al., 2007). Thus, the ORF1F2-16 to −26 products seem to constitute a nah-nag chimeric pathway for degradation of salicylate (compound 8 in Figure 4). E. coli EPI300 cells carrying the 1F2 fosmid grown in LB medium containing chloramphenicol were able to transform phenol, but not naphthalene, to its meta-cleavage yellow product. Despite these experimental results, no 1F2 fosmid genes were found to be homologs of known genes for phenol hydroxylase or its components. Therefore, the fosmid appears to contain novel phenol hydroxylase genes; the candidate genes are ORF1F2-3 (4-hydroxybenzoate 3-monoxygenase), ORF1F2-4 (ferredoxin), ORF1F2-5 (aromatic compound dioxygenase), ORF1F2-18 (reductase) and ORF1F2-19 (hydroxylase). In the 38 fosmids, genes of the novel I.2.G EDO subfamily were overrepresented, constituting 18 clones (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S3). (The complete sequences of functional EDO genes in the 3G3 fosmid were not obtained because of failure during contig assembly.) This dominance of the I.2.G subfamily suggests that this type of novel EDO may have an important role in our target environment (that is, coke plant wastewater habitat). All of the 18 fosmids (except for 3G3) carried a set of three genes encoding single-component-type phenol hydroxylase, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase, in that order (Table 3). The 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase genes on these fosmids were apparently either intact or truncated at the 3′-end. The fosmids containing an apparently intact 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase gene tended to carry an additional homologous copy downstream. Such genes, for example, ORF2C1-27 and −29 in fosmid 2C1, were 59% identical to each other in nucleotide sequence and their respective products were 38% and 41% identical, respectively, in amino acid sequence to 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase (encoded by pheC) from the phenol-utilizing B. thermoglucosidasius strain A7 (Duffner et al., 2000) (Figure 5). All of the phenol hydroxylase genes upstream of the I.2.G EDO genes are very similar to one another, and their deduced products are 46% identical to PheA from B. stearothermophilus BR219, the only known single-component-type phenol hydroxylase (Kim and Oriel, 1995) (Figures 1 and 5). Fosmid 2C1 is different from the other 17 fosmids in that it additionally contains two putative genes for phenol hydroxylases. These genes (ORF2C1-33 and −32) are arranged in a tail-to-tail configuration, and their deduced products are 48 and 37% identical to PheA and PheB, respectively, from B. thermoglucosidasius A7 (Figures 1 and 5).
