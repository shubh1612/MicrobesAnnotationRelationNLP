in oil reservoirs is not well understood. Analysis of existing genomic data has started to reveal their potentiality. It is tempting to speculate that, in high temperature petroleum reservoirs; these archaeal members play a considerable role during the initial steps of the anaerobic metabolism of alkanes. Information on the potential of biodegradation can be obtained from specific intermediates metabolites where their detection is indicative of microbial activities on a given substrate. Moreover, functional genes encoding key enzymes of specific degradation pathways can also serve as biomarkers. For instance, studies on alkylsuccinate genes by means of assA-targetd primer sets have provided evidence for the importance of novel groups of anaerobic alkane-degraders and the major role played by glycyl radical dependent addition to fumarate ( Callaghan et al. 2010). However, physiologically distinct microorganisms, e.g., strain Hxd3, utilize fumarate-independent mechanisms to activate their alkane substrates. Therefore, additional research at the genomic level will be necessary to reveal the genetic associated with these new biochemical pathways. Finally, understanding the alkanes degrading communities with their biochemical function will significantly advance the knowledge about the organisms mediating the specialized biochemical reaction steps. This will allow us to better understand the biological processes responsible for oil biodegradation in natural environments and in petroleum reservoirs for possible biotechnological innovation and applications in utilization of the residual oils.
