Cores are clearly separated by CO2, and, indeed, the centroí¨d for day 80 is opposed to day 23 and the one representing the background. The samples of each core are arranged according to depth, selected soil parameters and biomass related variables. In the analysis of ‘Biolog area’ (Fig. 5), the number of soil variables was reduced by forward selection for the same reason as described above. Again four variables were retained for the RDA: Ptot (p<0.014), depth (p<0.036), volumetric water content (p<0.047) and Ntot (p<0.26). The total explained variance in this canonical model is 42.7%, ‘Time’ explains 9.45%, ‘Soil parameters’ 27.05% and ‘Biology’ 15.6%. Shared variance occurred only between ‘Soil parameters’ and ‘Biology’ and was 9.4% of the previously mentioned values. This result is overall significant (p<0.007). Descriptors which are well correlated with the two first RDA axes were either polymers or carboxylic acids, according to the grouping of [31]. ‘Biolog area’ data did not separate the cores well but arranged samples in the following ways: in the bottom right quadrant are samples with high organic matter, which proved to be positively correlated with the selected soil variables Ntot and Ptot, in the bottom left quadrant are samples, which were exposed to high petroleum concentrations and which is in accordance with the CO2 variable (see Table 2), in the top left quadrant are deep samples with a high water content, and in the first quadrant are less contaminated samples with small cell numbers. A11 and G11 have rather high cell numbers, have a high pH and are situated between two soil layers with high volumetric water contents. Measurable CO2 production started 16 days after contamination of our experimental field site. This was later than expected since the lag phase in the lysimeter experiment described in [28] lasted only one day. The production of CO2 was spatially closely related to the extension of the hydrocarbon vapor plume. However, although CO2 concentration clearly increased at 0.7 m from the source (Fig. 2), the bacterial cell numbers increased only insignificantly (Fig. 3). This finding was unexpected since Ainsworth et al. [23] reported on 104–107 cells per gram of uncontaminated, dry soil and orders of magnitude higher cell numbers when contaminants were present at relatively high but not toxic concentrations. Zarda and co-workers [14] drilled cores through the unsaturated zone above a xylene plume. They found elevated numbers of bacteria and protists, especially in the xylene-affected zone just above the groundwater table and in the saturated zone. Pasteris et al. [28] observed increasing cell numbers in a lysimeter study after contamination by a similar petroleum mixture as the one used here, using the same counting method. Since in our study neither a significant increase in cell numbers nor a correlation between CO2 production and cell numbers could be detected, it is likely that growth was limited by soil parameters such as nutrient concentrations and that degradation was essentially due to the metabolism of non-growing cells. Zhou and Crawford [40] showed that biodegradation of gasoline vapors in soil depended on the C:N ratio. The authors suggested that lower C:N ratios favored microbial growth. A good C:N ratio for their soils was 50:1 or lower. The natural ratio of TOC:N in the unsaturated zone of the Værløse soils is between 20:1 and 50:1. Taking into account the hydrocarbon contamination, which exceeds 1780 ppm described in [40], the ratio becomes higher than 50:1 and is thus outside the reported optimal range.
