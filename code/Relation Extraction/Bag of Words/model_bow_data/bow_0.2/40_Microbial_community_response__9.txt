Batch experiments carried out with Værløse soil showed increasing degradation when ammonium vapor was added (N. Dakhel and P. Höhener, personal communication), which confirms the assumption of N-limitation. This finding is in agreement with the better correlation of cell numbers with Ntot than with any other soil parameter (R2 >0.9) and is concordant with results of [41], who found N limitation for toluene degradation in subsurface soils. 4.2Parameters influencing community size, activity and structure The forward selection for the RDA model assessed the following order from the most to the least explicative variable of the ‘Biology data’: Ptot > Ntot > temperature > pH > water content > TOC > Ctot > depth. PLFA data ordination in a study from [42] about sheep grazing on grassland shows that the microbial biomass variation among soils as determined by PLFA quantification is mostly correlated to differences in organic matter content and soil pH. Cell numbers in our study correlated negatively with pH. Ntot and TOC were highly correlated so that only the former was used for RDA. Neither CO2 nor hydrocarbons were detected in topsoil since the gases diffused out to the atmosphere. Hence, topsoil samples in Fig. 4(b) are apart from the CO2 axis. The uncontaminated core A is more dispersed along the cell number–pH axis than contaminated samples. Samples A11 and G11, which are rich in nitrogen and bacteria and have a lower water content than their neighboring samples, are not clearly grouped apart of the other data points in Fig. 4(b). This is different from what is inferred from the ‘Biolog area’ graph (Fig. 5(b)). Bacteria in these samples were able to degrade more substrates than in surface samples. The CV shows that this finding was reproducible. The reciprocal Simpson index [43] was 25.6 for A11 and 20.7 for G11 and, hence, significantly higher than the average of the subsurface samples (samples 5–10, A= 13.6, D= 11.4 and G= 9.07) and the surface samples (samples 1–3, A= 15.34, D= 14.53 and G= 16.4). It is remarkable that samples exposed to highest hydrocarbon doses are clustering together in the RDA plot since distinctive grouping of these exposed samples with PCA did not occur. The kerosene vapor concentration of these samples in the third quadrant was higher than 10 g m−3 at the sample day. The distance from the origin to the data point for day 23 is longer than to the point of day 80. This may be indicative of a higher influence of the contamination on functional diversity after 3 weeks. Other authors reported on distinction due to hydrocarbon contamination but in most cases they applied higher oil concentrations [4]. Bundy and coworkers [10] incubated three different soils with diesel oil for 103 days in jar microcosm experiments. By performing PCA on Biolog GN data, they found that contaminated samples were clearly separated from uncontaminated samples, but that controls were also altered. Biolog plates have in the last few years become a widely used tool in soil microbiology and they are generally considered as a sensitive tool to fingerprint communities [4,44,45], however, the method for analyzing the data is still open to debate. In most studies the classical GN2 plates with their 95 substrates plates are used [29]. The reduction of substrates to 31 by using BiologTM EcoPlates proved to be useful in our study because more repetitions could be made on one plate and the weak pattern reproducibility in the samples at depths around −1.75 and −2.90 m became apparent. This weak reproducibility as reported in the CV in Table 3 occurred at all sampling times and was probably not a methodic artifact but was due to the low microbial activity. A more sensitive tetrazolium dye in BiologTM EcoPlates would probably increase the reproducibility.
