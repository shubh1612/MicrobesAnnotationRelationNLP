Each type of molecular approach—metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and single cell genomics—is shown, as are the subsequent, novel bioinformatics approaches that were used to analyze the various data sets. Full figure and legend (116K) Top of page Materials and methods Sample collection From each station, 1–5 l of seawater were filtered through a 0.2-μm diameter filter from the Gulf of Mexico during two monitoring cruises from 27 May 2010 to 2 June 2010 on the R/V Ocean Veritas and R/V Brooks McCall. Detailed information regarding sample collection can be found in Hazen et al. (2010). DNA extraction DNA was extracted from microbial cells collected onto filters using a modified Miller method (Miller et al., 1999), with the addition of a pressure lysis step to increase cell-lysis efficiency. One-half of each filter was placed into a Pressure Biosciences FT500 Pulse Tube (Pressure Biosciences, Easton, MA, USA). A total of 300 μl of Miller phosphate buffer and 300 μl of Miller SDS lysis buffer were added and mixed. A solution of 600 μl phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) was then added. The samples were subjected to pressure cycling at 35 000 psi for 20 s and 0 psi for 10 s for a total of 20 cycles using the Barocycler NEP3229 (Pressure Biosciences). After pressure cycling, the sample material was transferred to a Lysing Matrix E tube (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA) and the samples were subjected to bead beating at 5.5 m s−1 for 45 s in a FastPrep instrument (MP Biomedicals). The tubes were centrifuged at 16 000 g for 5 min at 4 °C, 540 μl of supernatant was transferred to a 2-ml tube and an equal volume of chloroform was added. The individual samples were mixed by inversion and then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 5 min. A total of 400 μl of the aqueous phase was transferred to another tube and two volumes of Solution S3 (MoBio, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were added and mixed by inversion. The rest of the clean-up procedures followed the instructions in the MoBio Soil DNA extraction kit. Samples were recovered in 60 μl Solution S5 and stored at −20 °C. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified from the DNA extracts using the primer pair 926wF (5′-AAACTYAAAKGAATTGRCGG-3′) and 1392R (Lane, 1991) as previously described (Kunin et al., 2010). The reverse primer included a 5-bp barcode for multiplexing of samples during sequencing. Emulsion PCR and sequencing of the PCR amplicons was performed at DOE’s Joint Genome Institute following the manufacturer’s instructions for the Roche (Branford, CT, USA) 454 GS Titanium technology (Allgaier et al., 2010). A total of 87 000 pyrotag sequences were obtained and analyzed using QIIME (Caporaso et al., 2010a). Briefly, 16S rRNA gene sequences were clustered with uclust (Edgar, 2010) and assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% similarity. Representative sequences from each OTU were aligned with Pynast (Caporaso et al., 2010b) using the Greengenes (DeSantis et al., 2006) core set. Taxonomy was assigned using the Greengenes 16S rRNA gene database (version 6 October 2010). As the number of sequence reads in each sample varied, the data set was rarified prior to alpha diversity calculations. RNA extraction and amplification Immediately following sampling and filtration at the proximal sampling station, samples intended for RNA extractions were placed in RNAlater (Ambion, Foster City, CA, USA) to prevent RNA degradation. Samples were stored according to the manufacturer’s protocol (in RNAlater at −80 °C) until the time of extraction. Total RNA was extracted from the proximal and distal plume stations, as well as from the uncontaminated sample from plume depth, as previously described (DeAngelis et al., 2010). The quantity and quality of extracted RNA was checked using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Specifically, the RNA integrity was verified by determining the RNA integrity number. For our samples, the RNA integrity number was ~9 on a scale of 1–10, with 10 indicating that no degradation had occurred.
