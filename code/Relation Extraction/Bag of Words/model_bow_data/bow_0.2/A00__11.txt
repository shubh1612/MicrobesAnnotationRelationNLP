This pathway was present in the single cells, the metagenomes and expressed in the plume metatranscriptomes. The capacity of the Oceanospirillales representatives for chemotaxis, motility, and for degradation of alkanes, may have enabled these cells to actively aggregate and increase in numbers in the plume and to scavenge nutrients using a suite of transporters and siderophores. In addition, by using a shotgun metatranscriptome approach, for the first time, we were able to determine which hydrocarbon degradation pathways and other functions were actively expressed in the deep-sea at the time we sampled, to ascribe these pathways to particular groups of microorganisms and to elucidate how these active processes shifted in response to the hydrocarbon plume. Given that the Gulf of Mexico experiences frequent, natural oil spills, elucidating the role of Oceanospirillales in oil disposition provides critical data in understanding how members of the deep-sea microbial community can rapidly respond and become enriched in the presence of hydrocarbons.
