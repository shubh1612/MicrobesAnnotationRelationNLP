However, in selected samples such as D7 at 1.97 m depth, visible organic matter lenses led to a high TOC content. Total nitrogen and phosphorus were distributed similarly to TOC. Volumetric soil water content was influenced by recharge in the first meter, but remained stable at a depth of 2.50 m. The maximum water content was found around 2.9 m and 3.3 m depth. The soil pH showed a distinct vertical gradient with values ranging from 5 in the topsoil to nearly 7 in the sandy unsaturated zone. However, pH values higher than 8.5 caused by carbonate minerals in the moraine gravel were found at 3.36 m depth in core A and at 3.2 m depth in core G. Carbon dioxide (Fig. 2) was chosen as the factor indicating microbial activity in the vadose zone. Background CO2 concentrations in the soil gas were heterogeneously distributed in the depth profile, but were lower than 0.9% everywhere (Fig. 2). A maximum was found in the topsoil at 4 m horizontal distance due to mineralization of natural soil organic matter. On day 22 after contamination, a maximum of 1.24% was found below the buried source, at 3.3 m depth just above the groundwater table, suggesting an increased mineralization activity in the capillary fringe below the source. On day 71 highest CO2 concentrations were found at 1 m distance between 0.3 and 0.8 m depth as well as at 3.3 m depth. The maximum values of 2.12% were found at day 87 at the same location as on day 22. There was a distinct lateral gradient of CO2 more than 10 m radially away from the source. The measurements of CO2 at 20 m horizontal distance showed that there was a seasonal variation in the CO2 concentrations. The O2 consumption (data not shown) was small and inversely correlated to CO2 production indicating that mineralization was essentially linked to aerobic respiration. The measurements ubiquitously showed more than 17% O2 in the soil air. The total number of cells counted before contamination decreased from 7 × 108–3 × 109 cells g−1 in the topsoil to 107–4 × 107 cells g−1 in the sandy vadose zone between 140 and 280 cm depth (Fig. 3). Increased cell numbers were found in samples taken from the capillary fringe (samples A11 and G11). In the saturated zone the numbers decreased again (sample A12, see Fig. 3). Two samples of the vadose zone of core D contained unexpectedly high numbers of bacteria: At 2 m depth the corer was drilled across a local organic matter lens easily visible by eye. Organic matter, N and P analyses confirmed the observation (Table 2). The reason for the occurrence of high bacterial numbers at the depth of 2.6 m was less evident, since no visible structural change accompanied the observed higher contents of organic matter, P and N. Cell numbers were best correlated with the Ntot (R2 for all cores >0.9, p<0.001) and organic matter content. Protein and cell counts were generally well correlated with the exception of some surface samples where the protein content was underestimated. Within a core, the AWCDs were very heterogeneous and sometimes not exceeding a mean absorption of 0.4. To compare plates at such low AWCDs was not reasonable in this experiment since surface samples had already reached this value after a few hours, although bacteria had not started to mineralize all of the degradable substrates by that time. Since the cell numbers in the vadose zone were very low it seemed to be unreasonable to dilute extracts of other samples to the cell density of those poor ones, which would have led to losses of bacterial strains. Neither, did we divide absorbance values by the AWCD since the activity of bacteria in surface soil and deeper vadose zone is very different, and we would have lost information as described in [29,39].
