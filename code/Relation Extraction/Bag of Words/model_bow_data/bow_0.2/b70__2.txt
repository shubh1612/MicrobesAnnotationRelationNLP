2.4. Diversity analysis The bacterial diversity of the aerobic and anaerobic enrichments was evaluated using 16S rRNA gene libraries. PCR ampliﬁcation of 16S rRNA genes was performed from total community DNA by using the bacterial primer set 27f and 1100r (Lane, 1991). Reaction mixtures (50 ll) contained 50–100 ng of total DNA, Sample GMR75 was ﬁrst homogenized in a water bath at 50 C. For anaerobic enrichments, the cultures were grown in Schott bottles (1 l) containing 500 ml Widdel B mineral medium (Widdel et al., 2006) supplemented with n-hexadecane or a non-biodegraded oil sample, named P1, as carbon source. P1 oil was described previously as a non-biodegraded sample from the Campos Basin (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Vasconcellos et al., 2009). Prior to inoculation in Widdel B mineral medium, P1 was autoclaved (30 min at 121 C and 1 atm) and the n-hexadecane was sterilized by ﬁltration through a 0.22 lm membrane (Millipore). Milled and autoclaved shale (10 g) was added to the culture medium (250 ml in Schott bottles) as a physical support for the improvement of microbial growth, in an attempt to simulate the conditions in the petroleum reservoirs. Trace elements (Widdel et al., 2006) were also added to the medium and the whole system was purged by N2 ﬂow and autoclaved for 20 min at 1 atm. Subsequently, the N2 atmosphere was exchanged for N2/CO2 (70:30) and Na2CO3 (5 m, 10%) and vitamin solution (5 ml) were added (Zinder et al., 1984). Finally, a cysteine–HCl solution (2 mM) was added (1%, v/v) as a ﬁnal electron acceptor. Hexadecane or non-biodegraded oil (P1) was applied as a substrate (5 ml) for the recovery of microbiota in the biodegraded oil (GMR75) used as an inoculum (50 ml). The anaerobic enrichments were developed in four replicates, incubated at 55 C for 120 days and monitored for cell density with turbidimetric analysis (MacFarland scale) and for sulfate reduction according to Kolmert et al. (2000). This standard turbidimetric method is based on the precipitation of sulfate ions in the medium with BaCl2, affording BaSO4. Bushnell Haas (BH) mineral medium (Eriksson et al., 2000; Sette et al., 2007) was used for the aerobic enrichments. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 and 200 ml aliquots were distributed into Schott bottles (1 l). Shale was added (10 g) and the bottles were autoclaved at 1 atm for 20 min. After sterilization, vitamin solution (Zinder et al., 1984) and 1 ml of hexadecane (0.5% v/v) were added to the medium, followed by inoculation with 10 ml of GMR75 oil (5% v/v) diluted in Tween 80 (1:1; Sette et al., 2007). The enrichments were developed in ﬁve replicates and incubated on an orbital shaker (100 rpm) for 30 days. Microbial growth was monitored for cell density via turbidimetric analysis (MacFarland scale). Taq DNA polymerase (InvitrogenÒ), 1X Taq buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP mix (GE Healthcare) and 0.4 lM each primer. The PCR ampliﬁcation was done using an initial denaturation step at 95 C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 C, 1 min at 55 C and 3 min at 72 C and a ﬁnal extension step at 72 C for 3 min using an Eppendorf thermal cycler. Two libraries were constructed, one for each enrichment. Ampliﬁed ribossomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and phylogenetic afﬁliations were performed as described by Sette et al. (2007). The 16S rDNA partial sequences determined were deposited at the GenBank database under the accession numbers HM059724 to HM059788. 2.5. Construction of metagenomic clone library 2.5.1. DNA preparation DNA samples representing aerobic and anaerobic enrichments were pooled and submitted to electrophoresis (400 ll) in a low melting point agarose gel (1%) for size selection (35–45 kb).
