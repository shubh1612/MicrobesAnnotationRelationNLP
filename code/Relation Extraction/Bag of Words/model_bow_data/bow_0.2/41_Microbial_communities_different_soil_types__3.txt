Oil was added at a level of 20 g kg–1 dry weight of soil (2%). This is of a similar level to concentrations used in many microcosm studies (e.g. Wünsche et al. 1995), and it is common for authentically-contaminated soils to have similar or higher oil concentrations (e.g. Saterbak et al. 1999). Nutrient solution was then poured evenly over the soil; additional water was added to bring the final moisture content of each soil to 55% of WHC. The soil was then mixed for a further 5 min. The nutrient solution contained NH4NO3 as the nitrogen source and phosphorus as a K2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer solution with a pH of 6·4. The final solution contained 28·0 g N l–1 and 3·10 g P l–1, resulting in a final oil : N : P ratio of 100 : 10 : 1 (approximate C : N : P ratio 100 : 12 : 1·25). These are typical values for nutrient-amended bioremediation (Crawford and Crawford 1999). Soil respiration was measured by monitoring CO2 evolution over a 6 h period using a GC equipped with a packed column and thermal conductivity detector (Perkin Elmer, Beaconsfield, UK). Respiration was expressed as evolved CO2 in units of nmol h–1 g–1 (soil dry weight basis; see Bååth et al. (1998) for full details). Commuity-level physiological profiling Standard Biolog GN plates were used (Biolog Inc., Hayward, CA, US). A specially-selected set of carbon sources was also tested using MT plates which contain redox dye and micronutrients but no carbon source. Carboxylic acids rather than hydrocarbons were chosen as additional carbon sources because they are less volatile and more water-soluble than the parent hydrocarbons. MT plates were made up containing the following carbon sources: caproic acid, capric acid, myristic acid, stearic acid, behenic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, protocatechuic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-toluic acid, 1-naphthoic acid, 2-naphthoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene, 1,10-dicarboxylic acid decane, cyclohexane carboxylic acid, (±)2-ethylhexanoic acid, sodium caprylate, sodium laurate and sodium salicylate. Glucose was also included as a positive control. Compounds were made up as 15 mmol l–1 solutions in either ethanol or 70% ethanol. A 3 μg aliquot of compound was added to a well. The plates were then left to dry in a sterile environment, and stored at 4°C until use. Each plate contained four × (20 substrates + four blank wells), i.e. four replicates per MT plate. Extraction of soil bacteria was based upon published procedures which have been shown to be effective (Faegri et al. 1977; Bååth 1992). A 10 g soil sample (wet weight) was added to 100 ml deionized water in 250 ml conical flasks and shaken for 10 min on a wrist-action shaker. Two tenfold serial dilutions were then made (5 ml+ 45 ml) of the aqueous extract. The second dilution (50 ml; 10–4 concentration) was then centrifuged at 100 g for 10 min.
