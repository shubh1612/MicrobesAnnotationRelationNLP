This study investigates the influence of petroleum hydrocarbons on a microbial community in the vadose zone under field conditions. An artificial hydrocarbon mixture consisting of volatile and semi-volatile compounds similar to jet-fuel was emplaced in a previously uncontaminated vadose zone in nutrient-poor glacial melt water sand. The experiment included monitoring of microbial parameters and CO2 concentrations in soil gas over 3 months in and outside the hydrocarbon vapor plume that formed around the buried petroleum. Microbial and chemical analyses of soil and vadose zone samples were performed on samples from cores drilled to 3.3 m depth on three dates and three lateral distances from the buried petroleum mass. Significantly elevated CO2 concentrations were observed after contamination. Total cell numbers as determined by fluorescence microscopy were strongly correlated with soil organic carbon and nitrogen content but varied little with contamination. Redundancy analysis (RDA) allowed direct analysis of effects of selected environmental variables or the artificial contamination on microbiological parameters. Variation in biomass and CO2 production was explained by soil parameters, to 46%, and by the duration of contamination, to 39.8%. The microbial community structure was assessed by community level physiological profiles (CLPP) analysis using BiologTM Eco-Plates. In the CLPP data only 35.9% of the variation could be linked to soil parameters and contamination, however, the samples with greatest exposure to hydrocarbons grouped together on RDA plots. It is concluded that, at this nutrient-poor site, the microbial community was dominated by natural heterogeneity and that the influence of petroleum hydrocarbon vapors was weak. Contamination of soils and the underlying subsurface by petroleum spills is a widespread environmental problem. In situ bioremediation [1] for a cost-effective environmentally friendly cleanup and monitored natural attenuation [2] for risk management are two frequently applied strategies to cope with petroleum spills. Both rely on the potential of the autochthonous microbial communities to biodegrade petroleum hydrocarbons, which is supposed to be ubiquitous in oxic environments [3]. The addition of hydrocarbon-degrading microbes is usually not more effective for hydrocarbon removal than stimulating the growth of the indigenous microorganisms, and indeed, inoculation is usually not practiced. A central question at polluted sites undergoing enhanced in situ bioremediation or natural attenuation is therefore the impact of petroleum contamination on the activity and on the structure of the indigenous microbial communities in the subsurface. Previous work, e.g. [4–7], focused on the bioremediation of petroleum-contaminated topsoils, covering microbiological, chemical and engineering aspects. The effects of petroleum pollution on terrestrial microbial communities have been studied at different experimental scales: in enrichment cultures [8], microcosm experiments [9,10], soil columns [11], lysimeters [12,13] and field plots or transects [5,14,15]. Various methods such as community level physiological profiles (CLPP) [4,16,17], phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling [5,10] and nucleic acid-based methods [15,18–20] have been used to study the composition of the microbial communities. Widmer and coworkers [21] applied three different methods (CLPP using Biolog GN plates, PLFA and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis) to evaluate the community structure in three different non-polluted agricultural soils. All three methods allowed distinguishing the soils based on fingerprints. After contamination of pristine soil with petroleum, an increase in microbial activity, but a decrease in diversity, is generally observed (see [8–15]). However, most studies with artificially polluted soils were performed in the laboratory, and significant effects on the activity and composition of the microbial communities in controls without contamination were also observed, as a result of the incubation process [10,22]. Thus, the transferability of long-term laboratory studies to the field situation is often questionable. It can be concluded that the best way to exclude incubation bias is to work in situ. The unsaturated or vadose zone is a fairly unknown compartment of the soil ecosystem [23]. Before the1970s a general agreement on a sterile or sparsely populated subsurface prevailed [24]. Since then, studies characterizing the microbial communities of deeper vadose zones between topsoil and groundwater were primarily focused on the influence of the water potential on the abundance and activity of microbial organisms (see [23] for review).
