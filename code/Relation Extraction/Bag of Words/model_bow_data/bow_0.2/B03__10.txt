A variety of other geochemical parameters were not predictive of the potential for benzene degradation (5). Thus, these results demonstrate that phylogenetic studies of contaminated aquifer sediments can yield insights into the microorganisms associated with contaminant degradation and raise the possibility that phylogenetic analyses will be useful for predicting the potential for anaerobic benzene degradation at other sites.
