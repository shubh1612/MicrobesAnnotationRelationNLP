Each complete ORF is preceded by a potential ribosome binding site [18] and ends with TGA as the termination codon, carAa, which is incomplete, also ends with the termination codon TGA. By comparison with analogous genes we estimate that the EcoRI restriction site utilised for cloning is situated between 21-bp and 78-bp downstream of the start codon of CarAa when compared to the corresponding genes from naphthalene (Pseudomonas putida G7 nahAc [29]) or biphenyl catabolic genes (Burkholderia LB400 bphA [20]). Further efforts to clone this region were unsuccessful. Intergenic regions were absent between three car gene pairs; these correspond to carAb which overlaps carAa by 11-bp, carAd overlaps carAc by 4-bp, and carB which overlaps carAd by 14-bp. Similar overlapping genes have also been described in other degradative gene clusters [16,19], and the absence of intergenic spaces between these gene pairs may reflect translational coupling of these genes in CB3, cf. biphenyl dioxygenase of LB400 [20]. The transcript containing carAd and FIG. 2. Comparison of the car locus from Sphingomonas CB3 with published catabolic pathways. The corresponding operons include the bph loci from Pseudomonas sp. LB400 [28], Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 [27] and Pseudomonas putida KF715 [22], and the car locus is from Pseudomonas sp. strain CA10 [22]. carB may also be subjected to some translational control due to the presence of the less efficient GTG start codons in these genes. Sequence analysis of the CB3 car genes revealed that at the molecular level the deduced amino acid sequences of CarAaAbAcAdBCD showed greatest sequence identity (31-53%) to their homologous counterparts from diverse biphenyl pathways. Homology also extended to the arrangement of these genes which is conserved between some bph loci and the CB3 car locus (Figure 2). The only other reported car sequence shows very low homology and divergent gene arrangement [5,6]. For this reason the gene designations we have adopted use the same nomenclature as that applied to the biphenyl catabolic genes, namely that from carbazole through to anthranilic acid [2](cf. biphenyl through to benzoate [23]) the genes should have the same letter as the isofunctional bph genes [22,24,25,26,27], but with a car prefix, i.e. carABCD. The cloned car locus from CB3 therefore encodes, by analogy to previously described bph genes, CarAaAbAcAdBCD. Gene organisation is conserved between the car locus of strain CB3 and bph loci of the type bphABCD seen in Pseudomonas sp. KKS102 [21] and Pseudomonas putida KF715 [22], where the bphC and bphD genes are closely spaced. This is different to the bph locus of Pseudomonas strain LB400 where the bphC and bphD genes are separated by a 3500-bp region containing bphKHJI [28]. The properties and characteristics of predicted polypeptides of the CB3 car locus are summarised in Table 1. Homology of the predicted amino acid sequences from CB3 to the CA10 car gene products is also shown and are particularly low. Sequence analysis reveals that the aromatic ring dioxygenase enzyme from CB3 is a class II type three-component enzyme similar to biphenyl dioxygenase [27] and toluene dioxygenase [17]. This is disparate to the carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase from CA10 [6] which is a three-component enzyme belonging to the class III type similar to naphthalene dioxygenase [29]. The terminal oxygenase component of the carbazole dioxygenase from CB3 putatively encoded by carAaAb consists of two subunits akin to those of biphenyl dioxygenase [27], naphthalene dioxygenase [29] and toluene dioxygenase [17] which is also disparate to the single subunit configuration of carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase from CA10 [6]. We find, however, that the CarAaAb amino acic sequences show low homology to comparable subunits.
