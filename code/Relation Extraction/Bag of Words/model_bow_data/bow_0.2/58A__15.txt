1993; Maloney et al. 1986) and during soil microcosm studies (Cheng et al. 1983) (Fig. 5). Even PCP was converted into bound residue in soil organic matter, when PCP-polluted soils were inoculated with a white-rot fungus (Lamar et al. 1990). The formation of polymerized products was also noted when chlorophenols were incubated with lignin peroxidase of whiterot fungi (Joshi & Gold 1993). The evidence for chlorohumus products resulting from oxidative coupling is based on the mass spectrometric identification of oligomeric intermediates and the incorporation of ring-labelled 14C into high MW humic polymers. Coupling is not only mediated by phenol oxidizing enzymes, and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol was slowly converted to a dimer product by autoxidation in mildly alkaline conditions (Hodin et al. 1991). Chlorohumus polymers prepared from the enzymatic coupling of chlorophenols were found to be poorly biodegradable when incubated with natural mixed cultures of soil (Dec & Bollag 1988). These high MW compounds are non-toxic; consequently, polymerization of chlorophenols has been found to cause their detoxification (Bollag et al. 1988; Lyr 1963). However, it should be noted that the initial steps in the oxidative coupling of chlorophenolic pollutants can possibly lead to dioxin formation. For example, minor but significant yields of dioxins were produced from chlorophenols when incubated with various peroxidases (Maloney et al. 1986; Oberg et al. 1990) (Fig. 5). Nitroaromatic pollutants have repeatedly been reported to undergo polymerization reactions under aerobic conditions (Crawford 1993; Marvin-Sikkema & Bont 1994). The reactive sites are presumably hydroxyamino and amino-groups resulting from the reduction of a nitro group. The identification of tetranitroazoxytoluene and dinitro-azoxytoluene intermediates derived from TNT and DNT during aerobic biodegradation, respectively, provides evidence for the initial steps in the polymerization (Kaplan & Kaplan 1982; McCormick et al. 1976; McCormick et al. 1978) (Fig. 5). The incorporation of these compounds into humic macropolymers and bound residue in large yields has been confirmed by 14C labelling as well as by infrared spectra characteristics of the polymers Fig. 6.
