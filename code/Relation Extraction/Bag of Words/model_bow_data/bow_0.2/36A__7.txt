Real-time PCR is an ideal technique for ecological studies as a single DNA extract can be analyzed for many genes, allowing a quantitative approach to analyzing both community structure and function. However, it is important that real-time PCR assays are tested thoroughly for specificity and reproducibility and that the limitations of the method are recognized. The authors would like to thank Paul McA. Harvey (Australian Antarctic Division) for carrying out the chemical analysis of the soil samples. This work was supported by AAS grant 1163.
