1990) or a biogenic reduced cofactor such as vitamin B 12 is involved which is known to occur extracellularly (Mazumder et al. 1987). Anaerobic or facultative treatment systems commonly outperform the aerobic activated sludge process in the removal of AOX from bleaching effluents (Ferguson 1994; Jokela et al. 1993). Aerobes. Polynitro aromatics are a troublesome family of pollutants for aerobic biotreatment systems. No or little biodegradation of 2,6-, 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) occurred in activated sludge during aerobic incubations (Hallas & Alexander 1983; Liu et al. 1984; McCormick et al. 1976; Pitter 1976). Likewise no elimination of dinoseb (2-sec-butyl-4-,6-dinitrophenol), a pesticide, was observed during long term incubations in aerobic soil (Kaake et al. 1992). Nor was it possible to enrich microorganisms capable of converting dinoseb in well aerated (shaken) cultures (Stevens et al. 1991). Dinitrophenol and dinitrobenzoate were degraded slowly in aerobic activated sludge (Pitter 1976). These polynitro aromatics however cannot be considered as being completely recalcitrant to aerobic bacteria since, several aerobic bacterial strains have been isolated with exceptional biodegradative capacities towards polyni- tro aromatics. Some of the strains initiate the attack by reducing the nitro groups despite the aerobic conditions (Hallas & Alexander 1983; Marvin-Sikkema & Bont 1994; McCormick et al. 1978). Ligninolytic fungi also use this strategy for the initial attack of DNT and TNT (Stahl & Aust 1993; Valli et al. 1992). Other strains have even been identified which can attack the molecules with their oxygenases despite the presence of two or even three electron-withdrawing nitro groups (Marvin-Sikkema & de Bont 1994). In contrast to polynitro aromatics, simple compounds such as mononitroaromatics, nitroanilines, nitrophenols and nitrobenzoates are readily metabolized by aerobic natural mixed cultures (Hallas & Alexander 1983; Malaney 1960; Pitter 1976) and by bacterial isolates (Marvin-Sikkema & de Bont 1994). Anaerobes. Dinitrobenzenes and dinitrotoluenes which typically persist in aerobic natural mixed cultures, were found to be biotransformed if air was excluded from the incubation (Hallas & Alexander 1983; Liu et al. 1984). TNT biodegradation readily occurs in soil and sludge under anaerobic conditions (Boopathy et al. 1993; Funk et al. 1993). Anaerobic degradation of TNT proceeds via the reduction of the nitro groups, yielding triaminotoluene (Funk et al. 1993; McCormick et al.
