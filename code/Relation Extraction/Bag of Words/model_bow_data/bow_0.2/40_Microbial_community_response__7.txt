Hence, PCA profiles of the areas under the curve up to 120 h were compared with those using data at 72 and 96 h and no obvious differences were detected, indicating that an incubation time of 72 h was long enough to level out differences in inoculum densities. The substrate richness (S) at 72 h is indicated in Table 3. All three cores show a similar pattern of S and CV. Generally, S and CV tended to decrease with depth. Unexpectedly high values were, however, found in samples A11 and G11 from the capillary fringe, indicating high functional diversity. In core D, high values for both parameters were found in the organic matter rich sample D7 at 1.97 m depth. The low cell number in some of the deeper samples led to only few degraded substrates and to considerable variations between replicates. The correlation structure between the variables ‘Biology data’, ‘Soil parameters’ and ‘Time’ is summarized in Fig. 4, whereas Fig. 5 shows the correlation structure between ‘Biolog area 120h’, ‘Soil parameters’, ‘Time’ and ‘Biology data’. Hydrocarbon concentrations in soil gas were not used since the variance inflation factors in the canonical regression model were very high and the 13 variables (petroleum hydrocarbons) had to be reduced to two. Instead, the time can be used as an indirect measure of the exposure by hydrocarbon pollution. The variance in the ‘Biology data’ (Fig. 4(a)), consisting of cell counts, protein quantification and CO2 measurements, could be explained to 46% by the ‘Soil parameters’, and ‘Time’ explained another 39.8% of variance, 5.7% of those values being shared. This result is significant overall (p<0.001). Forward selection was used in order to reduce the number of variables of ‘Soil parameters’ to approximately the same as in ‘Time’. Variables explaining the largest statistically significant amount of variation were Ptot (p<0.001), Ntot (p<0.001), temperature (p<0.005) and pH (p<0.046). With these variables, 51.2% of variance was explained, but we eliminated ‘temperature’ since some missing values were calculated. The next most significant variable, ‘water content’, was instead included in the further RDA. Depth, TOC and total carbon (TC) were all highly correlated with the above-mentioned variables. In the triplots Fig. 4(b) and 5(b), quantitative variables are represented by arrows, qualitative explanatory variables (centroí¨ds) are indicated by their label. The angle between two arrows and between an arrow and an axis or between an arrow and inter-connecting line between the origin and an object-point are proportional to the correlation. Distance between object-points and between centroí¨d-points, or between each other, are interpreted, respectively, as a mutual similarity or contribution. The projection of a centroïd-point onto an arrow is proportional to its contribution. High correlations between cell number, Ntot, Ptot and protein measurements and the first RDA axis are observed. The pH is negatively correlated with those variables. CO2 is correlated with axis 2. It is remarkable that the arrow ‘CO2 content’ is perpendicular to the arrow ‘cell numbers’, meaning that they are independent.
