Our results also imply that there is a great potential for in situ bioremediation of oil contaminants in the deep-seawater ecosystem, and such oil-degrading populations and associated microbial communities may have a significant role in determining the ultimate fates and consequences of the spilled oil. However, to further understand and evaluate the potential impacts of this unprecedented oil spill on the marine ecosystem structure and function, it is essential to launch an integrated and comprehensive monitoring program to track the dynamics and adaptive responses of microbial communities together with other physical and chemical analysis of tracing oil contaminants and their products.
