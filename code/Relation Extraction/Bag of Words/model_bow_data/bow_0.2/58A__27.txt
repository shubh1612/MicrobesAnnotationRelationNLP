Therefore, the recalcitrant nature of polychloro- and polynitro-aromatics as well as azo dyes can be overcome by utilizing anaerobic-aerobic cocultures. Polymerization of polyhydroxylated and chlorinated phenols as well as nitroaromatics and aromatic amines in aerobic environments is a second factor related to the aerobic recalcitrance of aromatic pollutants. If these compounds can be mineralized by anaerobic consortia, than anaerobic biotreatment is recommended in order to ensure complete biodegradation and prevent the formation of recalcitrant humic polymers. However, if these compounds are only modified in anaerobic environments by o-dealkylation and reduction of the substituents, the resulting products may even be more susceptible to polymerization in a subsequent aerobic enviromnent. Since polymerization has been shown to detoxify aromatic pollutants, the activation of aromatic pollutants for polymerization can potentially be encouraged by an anaerobic pretreatment step prior to oxidation. On the other hand, mineralization of polymerizable pollutants can possibly be achieved in anaerobic-aerobic cocultures. Pollutants activated by biotransformations in the anaerobic zone of the biofilm would migrate to the aerobic bacteria where they could be rapidly mineralized. In this manner, contact with the more oxidized bulk liquid phase, where these compounds would be susceptible to polymerization, could be avoided.
