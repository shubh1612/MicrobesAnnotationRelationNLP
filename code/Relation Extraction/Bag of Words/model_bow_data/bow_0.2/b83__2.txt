Plasmid DNA was isolated using a Quantum Prep Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Bio-Rad), and clone sequences were determined by the Waikato DNA Sequencing facility using a PRISM Ready Reaction DNA Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Perkin-Elmer). The reactions were resolved using an ABI model 377 sequencer. PCR amplification of car genes. A primer pair, C1036 (5*-GGGATCTTTGAACAGGACGA-3*) and C2495 (5*-AGGAGCCTGTCACTGACCAT-3*), was designed to amplify a 1460-bp fragment which contains the carAa(partial)/carAb/carAc/carAd(partial) genes. These primers were used to amplify the car genes from soil DNA, and also in an RT-PCR amplification experiment using CB3 mRNA as the target. Total soil DNA was extracted from 0.5 g soil samples using a bead beating method followed by purification through PVPP (polyvinylpolypyrrolidone) spin columns [11]. PCR amplification was carried out in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4); 50 mM KCl; 1.5 mM MgCl2; dNTPs at 200 mM each, 2.5 units PLATINUM Taq DNA polymerase (GibcoBRL); 0.2 mM forward and reverse primers; and template DNA at 0.1 mg/50 ml reaction. The cycling conditions (Techne Cyclogene Thermal Cycler) were 5 min at 947C, followed by 25 cycles of 947C for 2 min, 527C for 1 min, 727C for 2 min, maximal ramp rates throughout, with the final 727C segment of the cycle extended to 10 min before cooling to 47C. A Southern blot consisting of 20 ml of PCR product amplified from soil DNA resolved on an agarose gel and blotted to a positively charged nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus (NEN Research Products)) was analysed by hybridisation with 32Plabelled carAa(partial)/carAb/carAc/carAd(partial) amplified from CB3 genomic DNA. Membranes were hybridised overnight at 657C in 5 1 SSC, followed by stringency washes with 2 1 SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 657C, and 0.2 1 SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 657C. mRNA was isolated, using an RNA extraction kit (RNeasy Mini Kit Qiagen), from CB3 grown at the expense of different carbon sources. These included 2 mM carbazole, 10 mM acetate, and 10 mM acetate-grown cells induced for 2 h during late log phase, with carbazole and biphenyl added to 1 mM. Purified mRNA was treated with DNase I (GibcoBRL) and RNase inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim) to ensure complete removal of DNA and to maintain the integrity of mRNA. RT-PCR (Titan One Tube RT-PCR System: Boehringer Mannheim) was used to amplify a fragment of the car locus from mRNA isolated from Sphingomonas strain CB3 grown at the expense of different carbon sources. The cycling conditions (Techne Cyclogene Thermal Cycler) for the RT-PCR amplification were: 507C for 30 min; 947C for 2 min; followed by 10 cycles of 947C for 30 s, 527C for 30 s, 687C for 1 min; followed by 15 cycles of 947C for 30 s, 527C for 30 s, 687C for 80 s; followed by 15 cycles of 947C for 30 s, 527C for 30 s, 687C for 2 min; followed by 947C for 30 s, 527C for 30 s, 687C for 10 min, and cool to 47C. PCR amplification controls omitted the initial incubation at 507C. Optimal MgCl2 concentration was 1.5 mM. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Isolation of the car Catabolic Genes and Characterisation of the Extradiol Dioxygenase The extradiol dioxygenase activity detected in cellfree extracts of the wild-type strain Sphingomonas CB3 grown at the expense of carbazole was isolated and expressed in a clone designated pJO05 which contained a 7400-bp EcoRI fragment from CB3. This extradiol dioxygenase activity was induced by growth on carbazole and was not detected in acetate- or succinategrown cells revealing that this activity is under regulatory control. Southern hybridisation using probe DNA derived from pJO05 confirmed its origin from CB3 genomic DNA, it was not present in digests of the large (Ãº100-kb) plasmid DNA prepared from CB3 (data not shown). The identity of the extradiol dioxygenase enzyme encoded by pJO05 was evaluated by analysing the substrate specificity of the functional enzyme ex- pressed in Escherichia coli DH5a. Specific activity (average of four replicates) of the extradiol dioxygenase enzyme towards 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (820.6 { 19.4 mmol/min/mg protein) and catechol (24.0 { 1.2 mmol/ min/mg protein) revealed that the pJO05-encoded dioxygenase activity was characteristic of a multiple-ring extradiol dioxygenase showing a specificity typical of a 2,3-dihydroxy 1,2-dioxygenase (BphC) rather than a catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) enzyme [12,13]. pJO05 contained an internal EcoRI site which allowed the extradiol dioxygenase activity encoded by pJO05 to be further localised, by deletion, to the derivative pJO05-01. A second derivative pJO05-02, which lacked an extradiol dioxygenase activity was also obtained. An additional clone pJO12, located upstream and contiguous to pJO05, was isolated by screening a HindIII clone library of CB3 by hybridisation using a 300-bp EcoRI/HindIII probe derived from pJ005-01. Nucleotide Sequence Analysis of the Cloned car Genes The complete sequence of cloned inserts of pJO0501, pJO12 and 400-bp of the 5* end of clone pJO05-02 was determined for both strands to yield 6085-bp of sequence (GenBank accession number AF060489). The DNA had a G/C content of 61.1%, close to that reported for established Sphingomonas species inclusive of the aromatic compound-degrading sphingomonads (61.7-67.8%) [14]. Computer analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of six complete open reading frames (ORFs), and one partial ORF, each transcribed in the same orientation (Figure 1). ORFs were initiated either by the canonical ATG start codon (carAbAcCD), or by the rarer and less efficient GTG start codon (carAdB) which is not uncommon in operons involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds [15,16,17].
