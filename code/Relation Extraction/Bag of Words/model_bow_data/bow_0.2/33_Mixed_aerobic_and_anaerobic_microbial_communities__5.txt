The remaining seven clone sequences (AM946544-45) were more than 95% similar to methanogens belonging to the Methanomicrobiaceae from a toluene-degrading methanogenic consortium (Ficker et al. 1999). The Bacteria in DW3d were more diverse than the Archaea and were dominated by the Betaproteobacteria (27 out of 51 clones; Figs 3 and 5). Within this class, 14 clones (AM491921-22) were related to Polaromonas naphthalenivorans with more than 95% 16S rRNA sequence similarity. Other organisms were related to Rhodoferax ferrireducens (93·1–96% similarity) and to Bacteroidetes strains (AM990338, AM999987) in a consortium mineralizing benzene under sulfate-reducing conditions. The aceticlastic methanogenic Archaea in the deeper sandstone groundwater (309d) and the sand–gravel groundwater (DW3d) were very similar. By contrast, the predominant Bacteria in each were different, with the sandstone groundwater being dominated by the Gammaproteobacteria (Figs 3 and 6), mostly Pseudomonas species (38 out of 72 cloned sequences) (AM946149-52) rather than Betaproteobacteria. The most abundant phylogenetic group of Bacteria in the most contaminated groundwater (W18i) was the Betaproteobacteria (Figs 3 and 5). Some of the organisms detected in W18i were similar to uncultured micro-organisms from diverse environments, such as a reactor system treating monochlorobenzene (13 clones, AM491926), a petroleum-contaminated groundwater (8 clones, AM491925), and an isolate, Acidovorax strain P51, that can degrade chlorinated benzenes (6 clones, AM948962). Nine Bacteroidetes clones have close affiliation with a benzene-degrading sulphidogenic consortium, while 10 clones had 98·7% 16S rRNA sequence similarity to clones from benzene-contaminated groundwater (AY214176) that were very similar to Rhodoferax ferrireducens (as in DW3d). The highly alkaline groundwater sample (W18d) was, like DW3d and W18i, dominated by the Betaproteobacteria, though the closest cultivated relative to 22 out of 50 clones (AM491917) was the Hydrogenophaga strain YED1. However, these clones were more similar to environmental clones from a very alkaline groundwater, not known to be contaminated with hydrocarbons. One isolate with a high 16S rRNA sequence similarity to the dominant clone was obtained from well W18d, but this could not degrade benzene under the experimental conditions employed (AM980998). Three of the four wells that were investigated in detail have very low in situ oxygen concentrations (0–0·03 mg l−1), yet have the capacity for aerobic benzene biodegradation and harbour a mix of aerobic and anaerobic microbes. In each well the dominant aerobic (or denitrifying) population was different, but there were many similarities between the anaerobic populations. Oxygen is a key reactant in the crucial first step of opening the benzene ring; moreover aerobic benzene-degrading microbes gain more energy by using oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor compared with other typical electron acceptors. Therefore, aerobic benzene degradation is widespread and can occur rapidly. Nevertheless, benzene can be degraded under anaerobic conditions using a range of potential ring-opening mechanisms and with a wide variety of terminal electron acceptors, such as nitrate (Burland and Edwards 1999), chlorate (Weelink et al. 2007), iron (Lovley et al. 1994), manganese (Villatoro-Monzón et al. 2003), sulfate (Lovley et al. 1995) and under methanogenic conditions (Grbić-Galić and Vogel 1987), and even by pure cultures (Coates et al. 2001; Kasai et al. 2006). However, anaerobic benzene degradation is frequently much slower (Kazumi et al. 1997) and in many cases has been reported not to occur (Acton and Barker 1992; Barbaro et al. 1992; Kazumi et al. 1997). In the SIReN there is evidence that in situ anaerobic micro-organisms are involved in benzene degradation because many clones were closely related to those found in anaerobic aromatic-hydrocarbon-degrading consortia, and also by the detection of catabolic intermediates such as phenol, as well as methane production.
