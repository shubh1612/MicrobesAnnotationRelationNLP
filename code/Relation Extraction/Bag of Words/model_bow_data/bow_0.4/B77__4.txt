strain EK3.1 and EK4 have been deposited at the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) as Enterobacter sp. strain EK3.1 DSM 15156 and Enterobacter sp. strain EK4 DSM 15213. Detection of degradation genes by PCR with degenerate primers Purified DNA was amplified, using 5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen Taq PCR core kit) and standard reaction conditions, with degenerate primers: 1. Amplification of the alcB gene was performed by the following PCR program: initial denaturation step consisting of 4 min at 95 C; 25 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 C for 45 s, primer annealing at 40 C for 1 min; primer extension at 72 C for 1 min; and elongation at 72 C for 5 min using primers TS2S (5¢-AAYAGAGCTCAYGARYTRGGTCAYAAG-3¢) and deg1RE (5¢-GTGGAATTCGCRTGRTGRTCIGARTG-3¢). The expected length of the PCR fragment is 557 bp (Hamamura et al. 2001; Smits et al. 1999). 2. Amplification the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene (subfamily I.2.A.) was performed by the following PCR program: initial denaturation step consisting of 4 min at 94 C; 10 cycles consisting of denaturation at 94 C for 45 s, primer annealing at 60 C for 45 s and primer extension at 72 C for 2 min; and 20 cycles consisting of denaturation at 94 C for 45 s, primer annealing at 53 C for 45 s and an extension at 72 C for 2 min; and a final primer elongation at 72 C for 10 min, using primers C23DO_R (5¢-TCAGGTCAGCACGGTCA-3¢) and C23DO_F (5¢- CGACCTGATCTCCATGACCGA-3¢). The expected length of the PCR fragment is 238 bp (Mesarch et al. 2000). 3. Amplification of the nahAc gene was performed by the following PCR program: initial denaturation step consisting of 4 min at 96 C; 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at minutes; and a final primer elongation at 72 C for 7 min, using primers pPAH-F (5¢-GGYA AYGCNAAAGAATTCGTNTGYWSHTAY CAYGGITGGG-3¢) and pPAH-NR700 (5¢- CCAGAATTCNGTNGTRTTHGCATCRAT SGGRTKCCA-3¢). The expected length of the PCR fragment is 630 bp (Hedlung et al. 1999; Simon et al. 1993). Amplifications were performed in a total volume of 25.5 ll in 0.2 ml reaction tubes with a DNA thermal cycler (mastercycler gradient, Eppendorf). Aliquots of the PCR products were supplemented with the dye ethidium bromide and checked by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel and comparison to a 1 kb DNA Ladder (MBI Fermentas). Results and discussion Changes in the petroleum composition of the soil samples The changes in the petroleum composition of the landfarmed site over time were examined after extraction of the soil samples and analysis of petroleum contaminants by GC–MS. Figure 1 shows a typical trend for hydrocarbon degradation during landfarming. During the 14-month period, all n-alkanes were reduced 75 to 100% of the original levels. Even though the percentage depletion of each individual petroleum hydrocarbon varied between 5 and 10% between duplicates of samples and samples collected from different areas of the landfarming sites. We have calculated the remaining hydrocarbon concentration in our analysis using the mean value of two duplicates for every single sample. 172 Shifts in the relative abundances of the different components were observed during landfarming. During the first 4 months of landfarming, a rapid depletion of long chain length (C23–C34) and short chain length (C11–C13) compounds was observed (depletion by more than 50%), whereas depletion of n-alkanes with chain lengths of C18– C22 was much less pronounced (depletion by less than 20%). After 10 months of landfarming treatment, a further reduction in the concentration of all nalkanes was observed, specifically those of medium chain lengths, whereas residual concentrations of longer chain length n-alkanes was only slightly reduced further. A decrease of the n-alkanes with chain lengths of C13–C14 and C18–C24 of more than 50% was obtained.
