As shown in Fig. 5, none of the visible bands from consortium AM comigrated with bands from inoculated soil (treatment 6M), indicating that the inoculated microorganisms did not compete favorably with the indigenous bacterial community, even though they were originally from a PAH-contaminated soil (36) and the inoculum size was at least equal to (108 MPN g of soilâˆ’1), if not larger than, the indigenous population and organisms were periodically inoculated throughout the experiment (Table 1). Moreover, the microbial population structure of inoculated soil was very similar to that of the soil biostimulated with nutrients during the first 45 days, in which the maximum biodegradation rates were observed. Therefore, the indigenous population changed independent of the inoculum, indicating that the biodegradation process was probably the strongest selection factor for the shifts in the microbial population. Conclusions.This study showed that specific phylotypes of bacteria are related both to inorganic nutrient addition to the soil and to different phases of PAH degradation in a nonspiked PAH-contaminated soil, and it highlighted the importance of understanding how interspecies interactions, nutrient effects, and changes in PAH bioavailability and recalcitrance influence the degradation capability and structure of a microbial community.
