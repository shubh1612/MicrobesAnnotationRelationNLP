This hypothesis was supported by studies in which CSIA was used for characterizing the initial step of benzene activation in different cultures (Mancini et al., 2003; 2008; Fischer et al., 2008). Mancini and colleagues (2008) showed that the ratio of hydrogen isotope fractionation (Δδ2H) versus carbon isotope fractionation (Δδ13C) – a value defined as lambda: Λ = Δδ2H/Δδ13C (Fischer et al., 2008) – for anaerobic benzene degradation was significantly higher for the methanogenic culture (Λ = 39 ± 5) compared with the nitrate-reducing enrichment culture (Λ = 16 ± 2) investigated by Ulrich and colleagues (2005). Simplified, the lambda value can be seen as a biochemical fingerprint of a given biochemical reaction. Concordantly, other nitrate-reducing cultures showed lambda values in the range between 8 and 19, whereas for other methanogenic or sulfate-reducing cultures lambda values between 28 and 31 were determined (Mancini et al., 2003; 2008; Fischer et al., 2008). Thus, the CSIA data indicate that benzene activation under nitrate-reducing conditions is different from benzene activation under sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions. Nevertheless, ‘different reaction mechanism’ means that either the reactions are truly different (different products are formed), or the reactions are similar on paper (same products are formed) but proceed via different reaction mechanisms catalysed by different enzymes or cofactors leading to different fractionation patterns; the latter has been recently shown for toluene activation by benzylsuccinate synthase (Vogt et al., 2008; Herrmann et al., 2009). Hence, further research is needed to conclusively demonstrate that benzene can be methylated under nitrate-reducing conditions. Some highly enriched strictly anaerobic benzene-degrading cultures cannot degrade toluene (Kunapuli et al., 2008; Musat and Widdel, 2008; Laban et al., 2009), probably excluding biomethylation of benzene to form toluene as activation mechanism. Benzene carboxylation Similar to hydroxylation or methylation of benzene, benzene carboxylation is slightly exergonic or close to the thermodynamic equilibrium depending on the carboxyl donor and thus feasible even in sulfate-reducing or methanogenic cultures (Musat and Widdel, 2008). Additionally, for some non-substituted aromatic compounds, e.g. naphthalene (Zhang and Young, 1997; Musat et al., 2009; DiDonato et al., 2010) or phenanthrene (Zhang and Young, 1997; Davidova et al., 2007), a carboxylation reaction was suggested for ring activation, indicating that carboxylation might be an important activation principle for the degradation of non-substituted aromatic compounds in nature. Indeed, benzoate has been detected as intermediate of anaerobic benzene degradation in sulfate-reducing (Caldwell and Suflita, 2000; Phelps et al., 2001; Laban et al., 2009), iron-reducing (Caldwell and Suflita, 2000; Kunapuli et al., 2008), nitrate-reducing (Ulrich et al., 2005) or methanogenic (Caldwell and Suflita, 2000; Ulrich et al., 2005) enrichment cultures, concomitantly with the intermediates phenol (Caldwell and Suflita, 2000; Ulrich et al., 2005; Kunapuli et al., 2008; Laban et al., 2009) or toluene (Ulrich et al., 2005). Phelps and colleagues (2001) found deuterated benzoate (D5) as sole intermediate of deuterated benzene (D6) degradation in their highly enriched marine sulfate-reducing culture. Interestingly, incubation in the presence of a 13C-labelled bicarbonate buffer system did not lead to 13C incorporation in the carboxyl group of the benzoate intermediate, indicating that the introduced carboxyl group did not originate from carbon dioxide. This was in accordance with results presented by Caldwell and Suflita (2000) for their benzene-degrading sulfate-reducing freshwater culture. Here, fully [13C7]-labelled benzoate was formed when the culture was spiked with fully [13C6]-labelled benzene, showing that the carboxyl group of benzoate was stemming from transformation products of [13C6]-benzene itself, but not from the non-labelled bicarbonate buffer system. In contrast, Kunapuli and colleagues (2008) found both [13C6]-benzoate and [13C7]-benzoate in their iron-reducing enrichment culture during incubation with fully labelled [13C6]-benzene. Furthermore, the authors detected 13C-carboxy group-labelled benzoate if cells were incubated in medium prepared with non-labelled benzene and 13C-labelled bicarbonate buffer, favouring the hypothesis that the bicarbonate buffer was the carboxyl group donor for benzoate formation. However, it is generally difficult to interpret all these observations since benzoyl-CoA, the activated form of benzoate, is a common intermediate within the anaerobic degradation pathways of several aromatic compounds including toluene and phenol (for an overview see Carmona et al., 2009; see also Fig. 2); in addition, benzoate has been reported as an excreted intermediate during phenol degradation under methanogenic conditions (Knoll and Winter, 1987; Kobayashi et al., 1989; Bechard et al., 1990; Karlsson et al., 2000). Hence, the metabolite benzoate might be formed directly from benzene by a carboxylation step, but could be formed as well in later steps during anaerobic benzene degradation pathways starting, e.g. with a methylation or hydroxylation step. Lately, Laban and colleagues (2010) investigated their highly enriched iron-reducing benzene-degrading culture using an approach combining metagenomics and metaproteomics. Subcultures were grown with benzene, phenol or benzoate as sole substrates, and peptide sequences were subsequently identified based on the metagenome which had been sequenced before. Proteins similar to the phenylphosphate carboxylase subunits PpcA and PpcD of Azoarcus sp. strain EbN1 and to the benzoate-CoA ligase of Geobacter metallireducens were specifically expressed during anaerobic benzene degradation. Based on these results, the authors suggested that benzene is directly carboxylated by a putative anaerobic benzene carboxylase. The formed benzoate might be further activated by a benzoate-CoA ligase to benzoyl-CoA. However, an enzyme activity test for the putative anaerobic benzene carboxylase, ultimately proving this hypothesis, could not be established yet.
