depth) of a typical agricultural horizon (cotton field) near College Station, TX, and was characterized as a silty loam containing 15% clay and 60% silt, low organic matter (0.3% organic carbon), and a pH of 8.2. The Norwood/Baccto test soil mixture consisted of 75% v/v Norwood soil and 25% Baccto topsoil, had a pH of 7.1, and had an organic carbon content of 4.65%. The Baccto topsoil was a com mercially available sandy loam potting soil of low clay (4%) and silt (11%) content, low pH (4.0), and high organic matter (20.3% organic carbon) due to the presence of peat. Soil grain size analysis indicated that 99% (Norwood) and 95% (Norwood/Baccto) of the particles were ≤0.11 mm. Inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and organic nitrogen were higher in the Norwood/Baccto (469, 473, and 2921 mg/kg, respectively) as compared to the Norwood soil (20, 315, and 517 mg/kg). The initial moisture content of both soils varied from 18 to 28%. The pH of the six oily soils during the 12-month study did not change appreciably and varied from 6.8 to 7.5. Total heterotrophic bacteria and hydrocarbon degraders were similar and did not vary during biotreatment. Microbial enumeration of soil samples taken during the first 6 months showed that there were 108−1010 heterotrophs and 107−109 hydrocarbon degraders/g of soil. Bacteria were estimated by cell growth in MPN dilution methods using Trypticase soy broth (BBL, Becton-Dickinson) medium for heterotrophs and Bushnell-Haas (Difco) minerals containing 1% hexadecane for hydrocarbon degraders. Oily Soil Mesocosms. Approximately 4.5 kg (5% w/w) of heavy, medium, or light crude oil was added to 95 kg wet wt of Norwood or Norwood/Baccto soils. The sieved soil (1.3 cm screen) was mixed in a cement mixer to maximize hydrocarbon distribution. The oily soil was placed onto plastic sheeting for aeration and artificial “weathering” (2−3 days) and to manually break up clumps of clay and oil. A significant fraction of the volatile hydrocarbons was lost by this procedure. We calculated, for example, that based on the total BTEX hydrocarbons applied to the soil (5% oil addition) and the BTEX level at the start of the bioremediation process, about 40−95% were “volatilized” during the “mixing and weathering” process. Fertilizer solution was added to each 95 kg of oily soil as N (100 g of NH4NO3) and P (40 g of K2HPO4) at a C:N:P ratio of 100:1:0.2 (assuming a carbon content of 80% for crude oils). Deionized water was added to soils to a moisture content of 50−80% of the field moisture capacity. The fertilizer-amended oily soils were placed (12 in. soil depth) into 128-L capacity stainless steel chambers (45 cm × 45 cm × 30 cm) fitted with plexiglass covers. The mesocosms were continuously swept over the soil surface with humidified air at a flow rate of 250 L/h to minimize moisture loss and to aerate the soil. When mesocosms were sampled for residual TPH and O&G, soil was mixed and aerated and five randomly selected 400-g portions were withdrawn. This 2-kg sample was subsampled and submitted for O&G, TPH, and BTEX and toxicity tests. Methods for Hydrocarbon Analyses. (A) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons. Duplicate samples (40 g wet wt) of oily soils from each treatment were taken monthly for determinations of O&G and TPH. O&G content was measured gravimetrically after evaporation of the Freon 113 solvent used in the Soxhlet extraction according to Method 5520E (46). This analysis is similar to EPA Method 413.1 for total O&G. The Freon extract was either (a) treated with silica gel to remove polar compounds and analyzed by an infrared analyzer (Horiba Instrument Co.) according to EPA Method 418.1 as TPH-IR or (b) dried under N2 and the residue weighed and reported as gravimetric TPH (TPH-Gr) according to Method 5520F (46).
