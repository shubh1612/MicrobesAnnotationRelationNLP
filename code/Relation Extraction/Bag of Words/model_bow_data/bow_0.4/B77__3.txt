Analysis by GC–MS GC–MS analyses of the petroleum hydrocarbons were carried out on the collected samples, using a GC 17A gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), equipped with an XTI 5 column (Resteck, Bellefonte, Pa.), as described previously (Katsivela et al. 2003a, 2004). The QP 5000 quadrupole mass spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was operated in the electron impact mode at 70 eV with an ion source temperature of 320 C. Helium was used as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.0 ml min)1 . The oven temperature was maintained at 60 C for 2 min and then increased to 150 C at a rate of 20 C min)1 , followed by an increase to 320 C at a rate of 6 C min)1 . Samples of 1.0 ll were injected into the GC, operating in the splitless mode with an injector temperature of 270 C. MS analyses were performed in the full scan mode (50–400 m z)1 ). Isolation of DNA DNA was extracted from soil samples (0.5 g), directly after sampling, using the Fast DNA Spin Kit for Soil and the protocol of the manufacturer (Bio 101, La Jolla, CA, USA) (Borneman et al. 1996). DNA was obtained from isolated strains as follows. Single colonies were picked from agar medium, resuspended in 100 ll TE buffer (10 mmol l–1 Tris, 0.1 mmol l–1 EDTA, pH 8.0) and ‘cooked’ at 95 C for 15 min. The suspension was centrifuged briefly, to pellet cell debris, and 1 ll of the supernatant was used for PCR ampli- fication (Moore et al. 1999). 16S rDNA T-RFLP analyses The terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis was performed as described previously by Osborn et al. (2000). The 16S rDNA was amplified, using 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Ampli-Taq, Perkin-Elmer) and standard reaction conditions (Moore et al. 1996, 1999), with the primers 16F63 [5¢-CAGGCCTAACACATGCAAGTC-3¢] and 16R1389 [5¢-ACGGGCGGTGTGTACAAG-3¢]. The primer 16F63 was labelled at the 5¢ end with the phosphoramidite dye 6 FAM. Reactions (50 ll final volume containing 1 ll of the extracted community DNA, 20 pmol primer and 50 lM dNTP) were denatured initially for 2 min at 94 C, followed by 30 cycles of: 94 C for 1 min; 55 C for 1 min; and 72 C for 2 min; with a final extension step of 72 C for 10 min. The PCR products were purified using QIA-quick columns (Qiagen, Germany) and digested with 20 U of AluI in a total volume of 15 ll at 37 C for 3 h. This restriction digestion (2 ll) was mixed with 2 ll of deionised formamide, 0.5 ll of ROX-labelled GS500 internal size standard (Applied Biosystemsl, Inc.) and 0.5 ll of loading buffer. Samples (1.5 ll of the denatured digest) were denaturation at 95 C for 5 min and electrophoresed in a 5% polyacrylamide gel, containing 7 M urea, for 6 h 171 at 3000 V on an ABI 377 genetic analyser with filter set A and a well-to read length of 36 cm. TRFLP profiles were analysed using the Genescan software (version 2.1) (Applied Biosystems). The terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) sizes, in basepairs, were estimated by reference to the internal standard, using the Local Southern method. T-RFs with a peak height of less than 100 fluorescence units were excluded from analyses.
