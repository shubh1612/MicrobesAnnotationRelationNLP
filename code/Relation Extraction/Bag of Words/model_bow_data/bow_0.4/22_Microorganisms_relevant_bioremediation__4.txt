These difficulties have caused the bioremediation field to lag behind knowledge-based technologies that are governed by common rationales. As summarized in this review, information on microbial populations relevant to bioremediation is accumulating rapidly with the aid of molecular ecological approaches. Although our knowledge is not yet complete, it is time to initiate more comprehensive approaches to find common rationales in bioremediation. In some cases, for example, marine petroleum bioremediation, we have already found that similar bacterial populations occur even at geographically distant sites. Understanding the physiology and genetics of such populations may prove very useful to assess and improve bioremediation. Most importantly, we need to identify general aspects in certain types of bioremediation. For this purpose, I wish to propose the construction of a database that collects the results of molecular ecological assessments of contaminated and bioremediated sites. The database would provide bioremediation with ecological backgrounds and, in concert with currently available databases relevant to bioremediation, would facilitate the development of commonly applicable schemes for certain types of bioremediation.
