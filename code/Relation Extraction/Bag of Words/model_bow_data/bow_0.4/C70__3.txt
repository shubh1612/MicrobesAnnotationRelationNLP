(2007). The 16S rDNA partial sequences determined were deposited at the GenBank database under the accession numbers HM059724 to HM059788. 2.5. Construction of metagenomic clone library 2.5.1. DNA preparation DNA samples representing aerobic and anaerobic enrichments were pooled and submitted to electrophoresis (400 μl) in a low melting point agarose gel (1%) for size selection (35–45 kb). After pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (BIORAD CHEF DRII®) at 200 V (6 V cm−1) for 4 h at 14 °C, with an initial switch time of 5 s and a final switch time of 15 s, a strip from each side of the gel was cut off and stained to localize the DNA. A high molecular weight marker (Low Range PFG Marker, New England Biolabs®) (0.5 μl), a fosmid DNA control (Epicentre®) (1 μl) and an aliquot of the pooled DNA (4 μl) were used as references to select the region of interest. DNA-containing regions were cut from the rest of the gel (unstained), transferred to microtubes containing 0.5% TAE (tris–acetate–EDTA) and treated with gelase (1 U/μl of DNA). 2.5.2. Library construction The fosmid clone library was constructed using the Cloning-Ready Copy Control pCC2FOS kit (Epicentre®) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. After the end-repair reaction of the insert ends, ca. 40 μg of the DNA mixture (aerobic and anaerobic) was ligated, packed and transfected into Escherichia coli EPI300 cells. Clones were replicated in 96-well microtiter plates with LB medium containing 20% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. For validation of the metagenomic library, six clones were randomly selected and grown under appropriate conditions, and fosmid DNA was extracted using a FosmidMax DNA Purification kit (Epicentre®) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The fosmids were digested with the enzyme NotI (Promega®), and their restriction profiles were checked on a 1% agarose gel using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (CHEF-DR II, BIORAD®) at 6 V cm−1 for 6 h, with a switch of 5–15. 2.6. Rapid screening for detection of microbial growth on hexadecane The screening assays were developed according to methodology described by Johnsen et al. (2002) with some modifications. Hexadecane was chosen as a model compound to evaluate the ability of the fosmid clones to grow using it as sole carbon source. Clones were pre-cultured in microplates (96 wells) containing 150 μl LB broth added of chloramphenicol (12.5 μl/ml) and incubated at 37 °C on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) for 24 h. After growth, aliquots (15 μl) of the clone cultures were transferred to another microplate filled with 150 μl BH medium containing chloramphenicol (12.5 μg/ml) and hexadecane (1.5 μl), which was pre-sterilized by filtration through a 0.22 μM Millipore membrane. E. coli EPI 300 and Micrococcus sp. (CBMAI 636; Vasconcellos et al., 2009) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. After 48 h incubation at 37 °C on a rotary shaker (150 rpm), 30 μl MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2 H-tetrazolium bromide] (Merck®) solution (1 mg/ml) was added to each well to evaluate microbial respiration and consequent hexadecane consumption. The microplates were incubated again at 37 °C for 1 h. The generation of a purple color was considered to be a positive hit, while a yellow color was indicative of the absence of cellular activity (Bicalho et al., 2003). 2.7. GC–MS analysis of hexadecane biodegradation Clones with positive growth using hexadecane as sole carbon source were evaluated for their biodegradation ability using chromatographic analysis. Clones were pre-cultured in pools (nine clones per pool), and 1 ml aliquots were inoculated in Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500 ml of LB added of chloramphenicol (12.5 μl/ml), followed by incubation on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 37 °C for 24 h. The cells were centrifuged (5000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C) and the pellet was washed twice with distilled water. The pools were suspended in ultrapure water at 108 CFU/m. Erlenmeyer flasks (125 ml) containing 40 ml BH mineral medium with chloramphenicol (12.5 μl/ml) were inoculated with 400 μl hexadecane, 40 μl vitamin solution (Zinder et al., 1984) and 4 ml of the cellular suspension (each pool of nine clones).
