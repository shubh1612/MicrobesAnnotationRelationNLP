Of these, 31 were able to use benzene, 26 were able to use toluene, 14 were able to use xylenes, 12 were able to use styrene, and 10 were able to use naphthalene as sole carbon and energy sources (Table 1). Only two standards (standard 8 [Pseudomonas syringaestrain LQ16] and standard 26 [Rhodococcus globerulus strain Q6]) were able to grow well on all five of the C5+ hydrocarbons tested. Strain LQ16 had been isolated on rich PTYG medium, whereas strain Q6 had been isolated with styrene as the sole carbon and energy source. It is noteworthy that standards 1 to 20 were all initially isolated on PTYG medium and 13 of these standards grew with one or more C5+ components. This indicates that the ability to degrade hydrocarbons is a common trait among the culturable heterotrophs in the contaminated soil tested. Enrichment of soil microbial communities on C5+.Microbial communities were serially enriched from three C5+-contaminated soils (C1, C2, and C3) and from three uncontaminated sediments (U1, U2, and U3) on media in which C5+ was the sole carbon and energy source. Cultures were transferred every 2 or 3 weeks. The enrichments obtained at the different time points were identified by the accumulated time of incubation as 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 11-, 13-, 15-, and 17-week enrichments. The evolution of the microbial community composition, as monitored by RSGP, indicated that the compositions of all six communities, as defined by RSGP, were strongly time dependent (Fig.2). The RSGP profiles for enrichments obtained from uncontaminated soil U1 were dominated by standards 36, 11, and 25 (all Pseudomonas spp. ) at 2 weeks, by standard 25 (Pseudomonas syringae strain Q5) at 4 weeks, by standard 47 (Alcaligenes sp. strain B4) at 6 weeks, by standard 25 (Pseudomonas syringae strain Q5) at 8 and 11 weeks, by standard 26 (Rhodococcus globerulus strain Q6) at 13 weeks, and by standards 52, 47, and 15 (Alcaligenes sp. strains N1 and B4, Bordetella parapertussis strain LQ29) at 15 and 17 weeks. The enrichments obtained from contaminated soil C3 were dominated by standards 11 and 25 (both Pseudomonasspp. ) at 2 weeks, by standards 41 and 11 (both Pseudomonasspp. ) at 4 weeks, by standard 25 (Pseudomonas syringaestrain Q5) at 6 weeks, by standard 47 (Alcaligenes sp. strain B4) at 8 weeks, by standard 26 (Rhodococcus globerulusstrain Q6) at 11 and 13 weeks, and by standards 47 and 52 (Alcaligenes sp. strains B4 and N1) at 15 and 17 weeks. The community profiles of these two enrichments over time were remarkably similar even though the soil samples were obtained from different depths and have distinct contamination histories. The dominant organisms in the four other enrichments (C1, C2, U2, and U3) were also similar. All the community compositions obtained over time are compared in a dendrogram in Fig. 3. Early enrichments did not form a distinct clade, but many of the enrichment communities occurred together in the bottom part of the dendrogram (Fig. 3, cluster I). RSGP analysis of these early communities demonstrated that standard 11 (Pseudomonas syringae strain LQ20) (Fig. 2) was frequently enriched to a greater extent than other community members detectable by RSGP. All six enrichments converged to have similar community compositions, and they were dominated byAlcaligenes sp. strains B4 and N1 (standards 47 and 52). The communities at 15 and 17 weeks formed a distinct clade (Fig.
