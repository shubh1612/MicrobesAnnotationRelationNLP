Relative to vent gas methane (−203 SMOW), the sediments are enriched in D (−104 to −125 SMOW) by as much as 99 (Table 1 ; Table 2). The enrichment in D is best explained by extensive bacterial oxidation of methane. Straight-chain hydrocarbons (particularly C3 and n-C4; see Table 1 ; Table 2) are enriched in 13C, also consistent with bacterial oxidation effects. Relative to vent CO2 (+2.9 PDB), the CO2 from sediment samples (−28 to −34.4 PDB) is depleted in 13C by as much as 37.3 ( Table 1 ; Table 2). Our conclusions cannot be extended to all chemosynthetic communities but, where present in abundance, gas hydrates can have a profound localized effect on diverse bacterially-mediated geochemical processes in chemosynthetic communities. Alteration of gas hydrates appears related to duration of exposure on the sea floor. Our findings in this regard are novel. Carbon isotopic properties of hydrate-bound methane and CO2 from Bush Hill are consistent with limited bacterial oxidation (Table 1 ; Table 2). The a13C of methane from thermogenic vent gas (n=3; mean=−46.3 PDB) and altered gas hydrate (n=5; mean=−42.8 PDB) is consistent with bacterial oxidation of hydrate-bound methane. The mean a13C of methane in hydrate mound sediments (Bush Hill and GC 234: n=5) is =−46.1 PDB and in tube worm sediments (Bush Hill and GC 234: n=4) is =−50.7 PDB. It should be emphasized that variability within and between sediment sample sites is large (see Table 2). However, methane from one sample of Bush Hill hydrate mound sediment has a a13C of −51.0 PDB, and all sediment samples from GC 234 have methane a13C values that are depleted in 13C relative to thermogenic methane from vents. This suggests that thermogenic vent gas is not the only source of methane in these sediments, and that in situ bacterial methane is also present. The aD of methane provides an indicator of bacterial oxidation of thermogenic gas hydrate and associated gases in sediments ( Table 1 ; Table 2). For example, the trend of aD from thermogenic vent gas (Bush Hill and GC 234: n=3; mean=−200 SMOW), to altered gas hydrate (Bush Hill: n=5; mean=−168 SMOW), to hydrate mound sediments (n=5; mean=−138 SMOW), and to tube worm sediments (n=4; mean=−118 SMOW) shows kinetic isotope effects consistent with increasing oxidation of methane. Previous studies have only shown that bacterially-mediated processes occur in sediments associated with buried methane gas hydrates ( Cragg et al., 1996; Borowski et al., 1997). The a13C of CO2 in samples provides another indicator of bacterial oxidation ( Table 1 ; Table 2). The trend of a13C of CO2 from thermogenic vent gas (Bush Hill and GC 234: n=3; mean=−2.5 PDB), to altered gas hydrate (Bush Hill: n=4; mean=−21.1 PDB), to hydrate mound sediments (n=5; mean=−22.7 PDB), and to tube worm sediments (n=4; mean=−29.8 PDB) shows increasing depletion of 13C, and is broadly consistent with increasing oxidation effects. Factors such as fluctuating temperature, pressure, and rates of venting have been noted to potentially impact gas hydrate stability (Roberts and Carney, 1997). Unaltered gas hydrate at GC 234 appears to be recently exposed, but altered gas hydrates at the Bush Hill site experienced longer exposure at the sea floor. Gas hydrates at both sites appear to be decomposing when sampled. We suggest, based on data of the Bush Hill site, that gas hydrate stability could be impacted by (1) bacterial depletion of hydrate-bound methane, and (2) by bacterial depletion of hydrate-forming gases in sediments associated with gas hydrates. For example, one sample of tube worm sediment from the Bush Hill site contains only methane and C2 (Table 2); the gas is thus unlikely to be in equilibrium with structure II gas hydrate because C3 and i-C4 are absent or in low abundance. The occurrence of bacterial methane in this extreme environment dominated by gas hydrates and thermogenic hydrocarbons is significant. We hypothesize that thermogenic carbon from vent methane and other hydrocarbons is partially recycled by methanogenic bacteria, which could potentially favor methanotrophic fauna in other extreme environments at low temperatures and high pressures.
