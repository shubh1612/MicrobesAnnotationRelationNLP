B69 Microbial gene functions enriched in the Deepwater The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is the deepest and largest offshore spill in the United State history and its impacts on marine ecosystems are largely unknown. Here, we showed that the microbial community functional composition and structure were dramatically altered in a deep-sea oil plume resulting from the spill. A variety of metabolic genes involved in both aerobic and anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation were highly enriched in the plume compared with outside the plume, indicating a great potential for intrinsic bioremediation or natural attenuation in the deep sea. Various other microbial functional genes that are relevant to carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur and iron cycling, metal resistance and bacteriophage replication were also enriched in the plume. Together, these results suggest that the indigenous marine microbial communities could have a significant role in biodegradation of oil spills in deep-sea environments.

Chemical dispersants, including COREXIT EC9500A and COREXIT EC9527A, were used on site at one of the highest rates in history to accelerate oil dispersal. A deep-water oil plume was initially detected at a depth of 1000–1200 m below the surface (Camilli et al., 2010; Hazen et al., 2010; Mascarelli, 2010a), but at last account (Mascarelli, 2010b) could no longer be detected, presumably as a result of dispersion and microbial degradation (OSAT, 2010). Significant environmental differences in the deep sea of Gulf of Mexico from other historic offshore oil spills present an urgent need to better understand the fate and impacts of the oil on this specific habitat (Kerr et al., 2010a,b). In marine ecosystems, microorganisms are known to have predominant roles in degradation of oil contaminants (Head et al., 2003; Larter et al., 2003). Therefore, it was expected that the indigenous microbial communities would have a significant role in degradation of the deep oil plume. This hypothesis was supported by two recent studies that explored the microbial and chemical properties of samples collected from the deep oil plume (Camilli et al., 2010; Hazen et al., 2010). Hazen et al. (2010) used a combination of molecular, chemical and physiological approaches to investigate the microbial and chemical composition in the deep-sea plume compared with uncontaminated water from the same depth outside the plume. They demonstrated that the oil depletion was due to a combination of mixing, dispersion and biodegradation by microbes residing in the deep sea (Hazen et al., 2010). In this study, samples from the deep-sea plume, oil-contaminated seawater (hereafter referred to as ‘oil plume’ in the following text) and non-plume controls (seawater samples at same depth that were not contaminated with oil) were analyzed with a functional gene microarray, the GeoChip 4.0 Received 3 March 2011; revised 6 June 2011; accepted 6 June 2011; published online 4 August 2011 Correspondence: J Zhou, Department of Botany and Microbiology, Institute for Environmental Genomics, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK 73019, USA.

(ii) How did different microbial functional genes involved in key microbial processes shift in response to the oil spill? (iii) Were functional genes specific to hydrocarbon (HC) degradation processes enriched in the oil plume? Our results indicated that the oil spill dramatically altered microbial community functional structure, the marine microbial communities present were metabolically diverse, and that these communities were able to respond to the oil spill. Materials and methods The following is the summary of methods used in this study. More detailed information is provided in Supplementary Data A. Sample description Between 27 May and 2 June 2010, seawater samples were collected from the Gulf of Mexico during two monitoring cruises on the R/V Ocean Veritas and R/ V Brooks McCall (Supplementary Table S1) as previously described (Hazen et al., 2010). Briefly, two colored dissolved organic matter WETstar fluorometers (WET Labs, Philomath, OR, USA) were attached to a CTD sampling rosette (Sea-Bird Electronics Inc., Bellevue, WA, USA) and used to detect the presence of oil. The fluorometer results were subsequently confirmed by laboratory HC analysis. Niskin bottles attached to the CTD rosette were used to capture water samples at various depths with detected HCs. Eight samples (BM053, BM054, BM057, BM058, BM064, OV201, OV401 and OV501) from the MC252 dispersed oil plume, and five samples (OV003, OV004, OV009, OV013 and OV014) from non-plume at a depth of 1099–1219 m were analyzed in this study. To better define the geochemical properties of the plume and non-plume samples, two sets of variables were measured: (i) seawater variables (dissolved oxygen, temperature, small particle counts, total ammonia nitrogen, nitrite (NO2-N), total iron), orthophosphate (PO4-P) and acridine orange direct count) and (ii) oil composition variables (fluorometer detection of oil, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, n-propylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, tert-butylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, sec-butylbenzene, p-isopropyltoluene, n-butylbenzene, naphthalene and o-xylene, m- and p-xylenes) (Hazen et al., 2010). DNA amplification and labeling Approximately 100 ng of DNA that was previously extracted from the samples (Hazen et al., 2010) was amplified using a modification of the Templiphi kit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
