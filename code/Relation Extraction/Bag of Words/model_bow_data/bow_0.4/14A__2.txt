The Kuujjuaq samples (labeled K1, K2, K3, and K4) and the Alert samples (labeled Ac, A1, A2, and A3, which are equivalent to Pristine, I.D. #1, I.D. #2, and I.D. #4, respectively, in Whyte et al. [6]), were sampled from just below the surface to a depth of approximately 10 cm, sealed in plastic bags and transported on ice to the lab, where they were kept at 4°C until analyzed. Contaminated samples contained petroleum hydrocarbons originating from jet and/or diesel fuel spills. Total viable bacteria in the samples were enumerated after 2 weeks growth at 5°C, on mineral salts medium [20] containing 250 mg l−1 each of yeast extract, tryptone, and starch. 2.2DGGE analysis of total community DNA Total DNA was extracted and purified using a beadbeater method and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) spin columns according to Berthelet et al. [21]. A region of approximately 500 bp from the 16S rDNA gene (341–758, Escherichia coli numbering [22]) was amplified using the primers b341GC (5′-CGCCCGCCGCGCGCGGCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGGCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) [23] and b758 (5′-CTACCAGGGTATCTAATCC-3′) [24,25] which are specific for almost all eubacterial 16S rDNA sequences. The italicized sequence in b341GC indicates the GC clamp required for DGGE analysis. Each 200 μl PCR mixture contained 4 μl of PVPP column-cleaned soil DNA extracts, 25 pmol of each primer, 200 μM of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, and 1 mM MgCl2. The tubes were placed into a Perkin Elmer-Cetus thermal cycler 480 (Perkin Elmer-Cetus, Mississauga, Ont., Canada) and heated to 96°C for 5 min. The temperature was then brought down to 80°C and 10 U Taq DNA polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfé, Que., Canada) in 20 μl of 10×PCR buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 9.0), 500 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2) was added. Touchdown PCR, essentially as described by Rölleke et al. [23], was used to reduce non-specific fragment amplification [10,26] with the following modification: 20 cycles were performed at the final annealing temperature of 55°C. Amplification products were analyzed on 1.2% agarose gels followed by ethidium bromide staining to determine if the amplification was successful. PCR products were prepared for DGGE analysis as described by Teske et al. [27] with the following modifications: precipitation was performed at −20°C and the final pellet was resuspended in 10 μl dH2O and 4 μl of 6×loading buffer III [28]. DGGE was performed using a Bio-Rad DCode system (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ont., Canada), as described by the manufacturer. An 8% acrylamide gel with a 40–60% denaturant gradient was used (where 100% denaturant contained 7 M urea and 40% deionized formamide) and electrophoresis was performed at 60°C and 90 V for 16 h. The gels were then stained with ethidium bromide, destained in dH2O, and photographed. 2.3DGGE fragment isolation and sequencing DNA fragments from the DGGE were isolated as described by Rölleke et al. [23] and then re-amplified under the following conditions: 50 μl PCR mixture containing 3 μl of precipitated DGGE band, 25 pmol of each primer (b341 [underlined sequence in b341GC] and b758), 200 μM of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, and 1 mM MgCl2, overlaid with mineral oil, and heated for 5 min at 96°C in the thermal cycler. The temperature was then brought down to 80°C and 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase in 5 μl 10×PCR buffer was added. The cycling conditions were 1 min at 94°C, 30 s at 60°C, and 30 s at 72°C for 30 cycles. The single re-amplified bands were then purified using the QIAQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ont., Canada). Sequencing of the re-amplified fragments was performed using the ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Perkin Elmer, Montreal, Que., Canada) and the ABI Prism 377 automated fluorescence sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) as specified by the manufacturers. Sequences were submitted for comparison to the GenBank databases using the BLAST algorithm [29], the EMBL databases using the FASTA algorithm [30], or the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) [31] using Sequence Match. Sequences which demonstrated strong similarity were then aligned to reference sequences using the Geneworks II software (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, CA, USA).
