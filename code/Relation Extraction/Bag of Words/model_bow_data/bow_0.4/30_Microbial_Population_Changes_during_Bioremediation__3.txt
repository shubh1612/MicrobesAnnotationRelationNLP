Petroleum analyses.Sand samples from the field were collected every 14 days, frozen on dry ice, and shipped to Cincinnati for processing. The 100-g sand subsamples were mixed with an equal volume of anhydrous Na2SO4, the mixture was extracted by sonicating it three times for 10 min with dichloromethane (DCM), and the final dichloromethane extract was solvent exchanged to hexane (33). A Hewlett-Packard model 5890 Series II gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a Hewlett-Packard model 5971A mass selective detector was used for measuring the oil analytes. The mass selective detector was operated in the selected ion monitoring mode for quantifying specific saturated hydrocarbons, PAHs, and sulfur heterocyclic constituents. Operating conditions of the GC-mass spectrometry instrument have been described (33). Nitrate was analyzed by the cadmium reduction method (2) with an autoanalyzer (Technicon Instruments Corp., Tarrytown, N.Y.). DNA extraction and PCR amplification.Nucleic acid was extracted directly from triplicate 0.5-g composite samples (0, 8, and 14 weeks) as described previously (29). PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA fragments prior to DGGE was performed as described by Muyzer et al. (19). Briefly, thermocycling consisted of 35 cycles at 92°C for 45 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 45 s, with 1.25 U of Expand HF polymerase (Boehringer, Indianapolis, Ind.) and 10 pmol of each of the primers described in the work of Muyzer et al. (19) (the forward primer carried the 40-bp GC clamp) in a total volume of 25 μl. Thermocycling was performed with a Robocycler PCR block (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). The primers targeted eubacterial 16S regions corresponding toEscherichia coli nucleotide positions 341 to 534 (3). DGGE analysis.DGGE was performed by using a D-Code 16/16-cm gel system with a 1.5-mm gel width (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.) maintained at a constant temperature of 60°C in 6 liters of 0.5× TAE buffer (20 mM Tris acetate, 0.5 mM EDTA [pH 8.0]). Gradients were formed between 20 and 55% denaturant (with 100% denaturant defined as 7 M urea plus 40% [vol/vol] formamide). Gels were run at 35 V for 16 h. Gels were stained in purified water (Milli-Ro; Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) containing ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/liter) and destained twice in 0.5× TAE buffer for 15 min each. Images were captured with the Alpha-Imager software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, Calif.). Extraction of DNA from acrylamide gels and sequence analysis.The central 1-mm2 portions of strong DGGE bands were excised with a razor blade and soaked in 50 μl of purified water (Milli-Ro; Millipore) overnight. A portion (15 μl) was removed and used as the template in a PCR as described above. The products were purified by electrophoresis through a 1.2% agarose–TAE gel followed by glass-milk extraction (Gene-Clean kit; Bio 101). Purified DNA was sequenced with an ABI-Prism model 373 automatic sequencer. Sequence identification was performed by use of the BLASTN facility of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (2a) and the Sequence Match facility of the Ribosomal Database Project (18,25a). Cloning of PCR-amplified products.Amplification products that failed to generate legible sequences directly were cloned into the PCR-TOPO 2.1 cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Recombinant (white) colonies were screened by using a two-stage procedure to ensure recovery of the DGGE band of interest. First, plasmid inserts (12 for each band) were reamplified by PCR with vector-specific primers (M13 reverse and T7; Invitrogen Corp.). The products were digested with restriction endonuclease MspI and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (2% agarose, 1× TAE buffer). Two products from each digestion pattern group were reamplified with the 16S-specific PCR primers described above (19) and subjected to DGGE analysis to ensure comigration with the original band of interest.
