(2008) relied on a PCR-based approach to assess the diversity of EDO genes in the environment. However, these sequence-driven approaches still suffer from bias, in this case from the primer sequences selected for PCR. To overcome these drawbacks, we previously employed a function-driven metagenomic approach (Suenaga et al., 2007). Using environmental DNA samples prepared from an activated sludge used to treat coke plant wastewater containing various aromatic compounds, we constructed a metagenomic fosmid library in Escherichia coli. Using catechol as a substrate, we screened the library for EDO activities. Of the resulting 91 fosmid clones expressing EDO activities, 38 were subjected to DNA sequencing, which resulted in the identification of 43 EDO genes. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of these EDOs with those of previously reported EDOs revealed that more than half (25) of our newly identified EDOs were from novel subfamilies: I.1.C (2 clones), I.2.G (20 clones), I.3.M (2 clones) and I.3.N (1 clone). This result suggested a striking difference between the aromatics-degradation genes in our target microbial community and those that were previously identified in known bacteria through culture-dependent approaches. In this study, we investigated the organization of the degradation pathway genes in the 38 sequenced fosmid clones. Shotgun DNA sequencing was performed at the Dragon Genomics Center (Mie, Japan) as described previously (Suenaga et al., 2007). Sequences were assembled using Paracel Transcript Assembler software (Paracel Inc., Pasadena, CA, USA). Open reading frames (ORFs) were identified using Artemis software (Rutherford et al., 2000), which was also used to calculate %(G+C) content. BLAST searches (Altschul et al., 1997) were carried out against the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank DNA databases, and the final ORF annotations were made manually. Conserved amino acid sequences were identified using the InterProScan (Quevillon et al., 2005) and Pfam (Finn et al., 2008) programs. A tRNA gene search was carried out using the tRNAscan-SE program (Lowe and Eddy, 1997). Self-organization map (SOM) analysis (Abe et al., 2003) was performed using each 5-kb DNA window of inserts as a query. Pairwise nucleotide sequence comparisons were made and visualized using the GenomeMatcher program (Ohtsubo et al., 2008). The nucleotide sequences reported here have been deposited in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession numbers AB266111–AB266148 and AB471759–AB471780. PCR-mediated subcloning was used to clone some of the degradation pathway genes from fosmids 2C5 and 9C3 and from the fosmids carrying I.2.G subfamily EDOs. PCR was carried out with oligonucleotide primers (Supplementary Table S1). The amplicons were digested with XbaI and cloned into the XbaI site (2C5) or XbaI–HincII site (9C3 and I.2.G EDO genes) of pUC18 so that transcription of the inserted genes was under the control of the vector-derived lac promoter. E. coli JM109 cells carrying the recombinant plasmids were grown at 37 °C in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium (Sambrook and Russell, 2001) containing 50 μg ml−1 ampicillin and 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside. Shotgun DNA sequencing was employed for 38 fosmids. Single contigs were obtained for 22 fosmids. Table 1 summarizes the general features of the fosmid inserts, which together amounted to 1.5 Mb. The insert fragments ranged from 29.1 kb to 41.6 kb in length, from 53.9% to 69.3% in G+C content, and from 26 to 45 in the number of ORFs. In total, there were 1317 ORFs.

The catabolic genes in these bacteria have generally been found to form operons, which promote efficient and complete degradation.
