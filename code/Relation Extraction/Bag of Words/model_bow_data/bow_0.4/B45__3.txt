Water from the site of collection was also sampled at each location. All sediments and site water were stored in sealed jars at 4 ◦C until needed. In addition to the pollution history, these sites also differed in the amount of organic matter and nutrients present in their sediments (Table 1). Sediment characterization was performed by the Soil testing Laboratory – New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station using standard soil testing methods. The concentration of several ions in the site collected water were analyzed using ion chromatography. All enrichment cultures were set up as a 10% (vol./vol.) sediment slurry in defined mineral media, or in water collected at the site. The defined medium contained the following salts (in grams per liter): KCl, 1.30; KH2PO4, 0.20; NaCl, 1.17; NH4Cl, 0.50; CaCl2 · 2H2O, 0.10; MgCl2 · 6H2O, 0.41; and NaHCO3, 2.52 as well as 0.1 ml trace salts, 1 ml vitamins and resazurin as a redox indicator. The trace metal supplement was composed of the following (in grams per liter): H3BO3, 0.062; MnCl · 4H2O, 0.098; FeCl2 · 4H2O 1.49; CoCl2 · 6H2O, 0.119; NiCl2 · 6H2O, 0.237; CuCl2, 0.134; and ZnCl2, 0.068. The vitamin supplement contained (in milligrams per liter): biotin, 20; folic acid, 20; pyridoxine HCl, 100; riboflavin, 50; thiamin, 50; nicotinic acid, 50; pantothenic acid, 50; cyanocobalamin, 1; p-aminobenzoic acid, 50; and thiotic acid, 50. The medium used for the AK and TKT enrichments contained 23 g NaCl and 1.0 g MgCl2 · 6H2O per liter to approximate the salinity of sea water. In addition the methanogenic medium contained 0.4 g/l of FeCl2 · 4H2O and 1.0 ml of 2.1 M Na2S · 9H2O as a reducing agent. The iron-reducing medium contained a slurry of amorphous FeOOH (∼200 mM Fe(III)) formed by the reaction of FeCl3 with NaOH. Denitrifying cultures were amended with 3.03 g/l of KNO3 (30 mM), and 2.84 g/l of Na2SO4 (20 mM) was added to the sulfidogenic medium along with 0.7 ml of 2.1M Na2S · 9H2O. The sediment slurries were dispensed in 50 ml aliquots into 60 ml serum bottles under an atmosphere of 70% N2/30% CO2 (methanogenic and sulfidogenic) or Argon (denitrifying, iron-reducing and site water). Bottles were sealed with Teflon-coated, butyl rubber stoppers (Emsco, Philadelphia, PA) and crimp sealed. All enrichments were made in triplicate with duplicate sterile controls. The sterile controls were autoclaved three times on three consecutive days before initiation of the experiment. In addition, duplicate background controls were prepared in the same manner as the experimental cultures except that no substrate was added. These controls were used to account for electron acceptor loss due to metabolism of endogenous carbon in the sediment inoculum. The cultures were incubated at 30 ◦C in the dark without shaking. Strict anaerobic procedures were followed at all times. Each of the cultures, except background controls, was amended with a mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-, m, and p-xylene (BTEX) (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI) each at a concentration of ∼100 µM. BTEX was added neat using a microliter syringe. The BTEX compounds were the only carbon and energy source added to the enrichments. Enrichments used to compare the degradation of BTEX to gasoline were set up in the same way using site water as the medium and Arthur Kill sediment as the inoculum in a 10% (vol./vol.) slurry under an Argon headspace. The BTEX fed cultures received ∼100 µM of each compound, the gasoline cultures were fed 30 µl of commercial gasoline. BTEX loss was monitored by withdrawing a 1 ml sample of the slurry and extracting with 0.4 ml of pentane containing 100 µM of fluorobenzene as an internal standard.
