4. Conclusions This is the ﬁrst report of the construction of a metagenomic clone library from a Brazilian petroleum reservoir sample. The clones that showed excellent hexadecane biodegradation ability (>70%) are undergoing genomic and proteomic investigations to unravel the biodegradation routes that occur in petroleum-associated environments. The results of the present work demonstrate the potential of a metagenomic approach for prospecting the microbial diversity in hostile environments such as petroleum reservoirs in the search for biocatalysts for use in biotechnological and industrial processes.
