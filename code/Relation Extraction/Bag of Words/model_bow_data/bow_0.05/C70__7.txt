All these data confirm the significant results obtained in the present work using fosmid clones bearing catabolic genes from a petroleum reservoir, which were shown to successfully express hexadecane biodegradation ability in E. coli host cells. Investigation of the biodegradation ability of the five clones is being extended and other biomarkers (e.g. phenanthrene, naphthalene, dodecane and tetradecane), complex mixtures of hydrocarbons and crude petroleum are being tested as substrates. Additionally, sub-cloning assays are being conducted to identify which catabolic pathways responsible for hydrocarbon degradation are present in the petroleum reservoirs of the Potiguar Basin. 4. Conclusions This is the first report of the construction of a metagenomic clone library from a Brazilian petroleum reservoir sample. The clones that showed excellent hexadecane biodegradation ability (>70%) are undergoing genomic and proteomic investigations to unravel the biodegradation routes that occur in petroleum-associated environments. The results of the present work demonstrate the potential of a metagenomic approach for prospecting the microbial diversity in hostile environments such as petroleum reservoirs in the search for biocatalysts for use in biotechnological and industrial processes.
