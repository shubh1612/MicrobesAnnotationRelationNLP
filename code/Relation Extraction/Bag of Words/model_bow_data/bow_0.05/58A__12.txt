In contrast to aerobic conditions, almost all azo dyes tested are decolourized by anaerobic sludge (Brown & Hamburger 1987; Brown & Laboureur 1983a; Carliell et al. 1994; Meyer 1981), anaerobic sediments (Carliell et al. 1994; Weber & Wolfe 1987) and by pure cultures or enrichment cultures of bacteria incubated anaerobically (Haug et al. 1991; Meyer 1981; Ryan et al. 1968). Dye decolorization also occurred in continuous anaerobic reactors with immobilized biomass (Glaesser et al. 1992; Jianrong et al. 1994; Zaoyan et al. 1992). The dye redox potential was found to be an important factor determining the rate of decolorization in anaerobically incubated cells of the bacteria Proteus vulgaris (Dubin & Wright 1975). The reduction of the dye causes the cleavage of the azo bond, consequently aromatic amines are the typical products of this bioconversion. The products mostly depend on the rings present in the parent compound. Typical examples of cleavageproducts which accumulate as a result of the anaerobic biotransformation of azo-dyes are shown in Table 3. Electron donating amino groups Aerobes. The presence of amino electron donating groups is expected to facilitate the electrophilic attack of aromatics. Most of the typical aromatic amine end-products from the anaerobic metabolism of nitroand azo-aromatic pollutants are eliminated in aerobic biodegradability tests. Simple aromatic amines such as aniline and aminotoluene are commonly found to be biodegraded by aerobic sludge (Brown & Laboureur 1983b; Dickel et al. 1993; Malaney 1960). The more complex azo dye cleavage products, such as the naphthylic and biphenylic amines listed in Table 3, are also degraded in aerobic activated sludge (Brown & Hamburger 1987; Malaney 1960) or by bacterial isolates from enrichment cultures (Kulla 1981). Many dye cleavage products are sulfonated, such as the aminobenzene-sulfonate or the aminonapthylsulfonate derivatives. These too have been shown to be biodegraded by aerobic activated sludge (Brown & Hamburger 1987; Malaney 1960), aerobic enrichment cultures (Glaesser et al. 1992; Haug et al. 1991) and isolated aerobic bacteria (Thurnheer et al. 1986; Thurnheer et al. 1988). Anaerobes. Both nitro- and azo-aromatics are highly electrophilic compounds that are easily metabolized under anaerobic conditions yielding amino-aromatics. However, the electron donating amino groups are expected to pose a serious problem to further reductive biotransformations by anaerobes. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that most of the aromatic amines listed in Table 3 were not found to be biodegradable in tests with anaerobic sludge (Brown & Hamburger 1987).
