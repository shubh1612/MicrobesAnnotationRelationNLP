This low-speed centrifugation was recommended by Riis et al. (1998), who compared different methods of extracting micro-organisms from soil. The supernatant fluid (150 μl) was added to each well of a Biolog GN and MT plate. Absorbance of the wells at 590 nm was read using an automated plate reader (VMAX Molecular Devices, Crawley, UK). The plates were then sealed inside a plastic bag, incubated at 25°C in the dark, and read every 24 h over a period of 7 days. The 0 h data were subtracted from each subsequent time point in order to remove the background absorbance of the soil extract plus carbon source; the background was particularly high for the MT carbon sources. The average absorbance (average well colour development, AWCD) was then calculated for each plate and plotted against time to give AWCD curves. The incubation time data with AWCD closest to 1·00 were chosen for final data analysis, and normalized by dividing the absorbance of each well on a plate by the AWCD of that plate. The values for wells with no C source were removed and the data analysed by principal components analysis (PCA) using the covariance matrix. Soil samples (approximately 10 g wet weight) were frozen and stored at –20°C. All samples were then analysed simultaneously at the end of the experiment. PLFAs were extracted and analysed as described previously, using a modified Bligh and Dyer extraction protocol (Bligh and Dyer 1959; Tunlid and White 1992). Briefly, the soil lipids were extracted in a one-phase chloroform/methanol/citrate buffer mixture, and the phospholipids separated by liquid chromatography over octadecyl-bonded silica columns. The phospholipids were then derivatized to their corresponding methyl esters, and analysed using GC-FID (Bååth et al. 1998). Individual PLFAs are named in the text according to standard conventions (Tunlid and White 1992). TPH determination Approximately 10 g soil (wet weight) were ground over anhydrous Na2SO4 using a mortar and pestle until the soil flowed freely. The sample was transferred to a 250 ml conical flask equipped with a PTFE-lined screw cap, and an internal standard (squalane) was added. Extraction was by sonication in 50 ml DCM for 10 min; the extract was then filtered (Whatman no. 4). The extraction was repeated with 25 ml DCM, filtered, and the two extracts combined. A 5 ml sample of extract was stored at –20°C in a foil-capped scintillation vial; the remainder was evaporated under nitrogen at 40°C to a volume of 1 ml. The extract was then cleaned by liquid chromatography over 2 g silica (60 Å, < 200 μm) pre-conditioned with 10 ml DCM. The sample was loaded onto the column and eluted with 2 × 10 ml DCM. TPH was then measured by GC-FID. A 1 μl volume of extract was injected using a Fisons AS800 autosampler (ThermoQuest Ltd, Wythenshawe, UK) onto a Carlo-Erba 8000 series GC (ThermoQuest Ltd) equipped with a Phenomenex ZB-1 capillary column (30 m × 0·32 mm, d=0·5 μm) (Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK), split injector with a split ratio of 20 : 1, and flame ionization detector. GC conditions were as follows. Column gas flow (N2): 1 ml min–1; split flow: 20 ml min–1; injector temperature: 250°C; detector temperature: 320°C. The temperature programme used was 80°C, held for 2 min, then increased at 10°C min–1 to 320°C and held for 10 min.
