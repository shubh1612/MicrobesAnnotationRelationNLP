Consistently with lower carbon and nutrient fluxes, as compared to aquifers and topsoil layers, microbial activity and diversity is lower in the intermediate unsaturated zone. At a pristine site in Oklahoma with an unsaturated zone of 3 m thickness [25], biomass and substrate-induced activity of bacteria and protozoa were constant in summer and winter, but varied sharply with depth, with a minimum in the deep unsaturated zone above the capillary fringe. In a pristine unsaturated zone of 26 m thickness in the US Midwest, the lowest biomass and smaller biodegradation rates of glucose and phenol were found in unsaturated tills as compared with both topsoil and the deeper saturated zone [26]. Only a few field studies [14,27] report on microbial populations in vadose zones at petroleum spill sites. In most studies the petroleum is floating on the groundwater and investigations were limited to the deep vadose and the saturated zone. The significance of the vadose zone for petroleum biodegradation remains unclear and better characterization is needed at contaminated sites. Pasteris et al. [28] performed a lysimeter experiment simulating an unsaturated zone above a groundwater table using pristine alluvial sand as a porous medium. The CO2 concentration in the soil increased the day after addition of petroleum hydrocarbons and was linked to aerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons and growth of microbial biomass. Hence, the microbial community in the sand adapted within a short time to petroleum and biodegradation started rapidly. However, the unsaturated alluvial sand had been disturbed physically during filling of the lysimeter, potentially activating the microbial community before contamination. The main aim of this study was to monitor the activity and structure of an indigenous microbial community in a 3.3 m deep natural sandy unsaturated soil before and after artificial contamination with petroleum hydrocarbons. BiologTM EcoPlates results were used together with redundancy analysis (RDA) in order to test the relationship between functional diversity (using the term as defined in [29]) and site-specific variables. Detailed results on hydrocarbon migration were measured by P. Kjeldsen et al. (Technical University of Denmark, unpublished data). The field experiment was conducted from July 2001 to July 2002 at the site of the European project GRACOS at Airbase Værløse in Denmark, which is a location without prior contamination by petroleum products. At this site, a sandy dark brown topsoil of 0.3–0.5 m thickness is overlaying 2.0–3.3 m of homogeneous glacial melt-water sand, which in turn overlays 0.5–1.0 m of moraine sand/gravel, having visible white lime. An unconfined aquifer was found in July 2001 at a depth of 3.3 m. The water table was shown to rise between 1.2 and 1.6 m during wet winters. The site was covered with grass and had not been fertilized over the course of at least 50 years. An artificial petroleum hydrocarbon mixture of 13 typical kerosene hydrocarbons (Table 1) was composed from pure products, to which the chlorofluorocarbon 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane (CFC-113) was added as a conservative volatile tracer. To form a source of hydrocarbons, 10.2 liters of this mixture was mixed with about 200 liters of sand from the site and buried at a depth of 0.8 to 1.3 m below the surface in a round hole of 0.70 m diameter. After filling the rest of the hole with the original soil material, a lid of 1.24 m diameter was installed 0.3 m above ground in order to prevent direct rainwater infiltration into the buried source. The migration of hydrocarbon vapors and the composition of the soil gas were monitored with high spatial and temporal resolution for the subsequent 12 months after contamination. Stainless steel capillaries (1/16 in.) were installed in the experimental area before kerosene source installation (Fig. 1). The compounds in the pore-gas were sampled on sorbent tubes packed with Tenax® and analyzed by automated thermal desorption to a gas chromatograph with flame ionization and electron capture detection (ATD-GC-FID and -ECD). Soil gas and groundwater were sampled along a main sampling axis within 20 m from the source center. The groundwater flow direction, determined before the experiment, defined the main sampling axis (Fig.
