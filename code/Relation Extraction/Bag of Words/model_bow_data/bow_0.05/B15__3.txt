For example, P. aeruginosa RR1 isolated from an oil-contaminated site could not utilize benzene, toluene and PAHs (naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene) as a sole carbon source (Yuste et al. 2000), and P. aeruginosa CM323 obtained from a hydrocarbonpolluted subsoil could not grow on benzene and xylene, but on toluene and ethylbenzene (not tested with PAHs) (Cavalca et al. 2000). Thus, the ability to use a broad range of hydrocarbons would differentiate this strain as specific, even within the same species. Because microbial activity is of paramount importance to effective bioremediation, we examined the relative activities of IU5 under different temperature and pH conditions (data not shown). We found that the optimum condition for IU5 diesel-degradation was 30 C and pH 7, which is similar to the optimum conditions of a previously reported crude oil-degrading consortium (30 C and pH 7.5) (Rahman et al. 2002). P. aeruginosa IU5 showed 97% activity at 20 C and 74% activity at pH 5, suggesting that IU5 maintains a relatively high activity even under acidic conditions and different temperatures. Otherwise, this strain was restrained with 10% activity at 10 C and with 19% activity at pH 8. The IU5-based degradation of diesel in diesel-contaminated soil was examined in a soil-slurry system for 13 days (Figure 2). During this time period, IU5 could degrade a variety of aliphatic hydrocarbons in the soilslurry phase, with about 60% removal of applied diesel. Comparison between the gas chromatograms from day 0 and day 13 (Figure 3a, b) indicated that many aliphatic hydrocarbons (C10â€“C24) were removed, regardless of their chain lengths.
