The samples were allowed to settle for 10 min. Ten ml suspensions were put on ice until used. To estimate inoculated cell numbers and extraction efficiency, 100 μl of the suspension was stained by 20 μl of a DAPI/AO mixture described above, filtered and dried in ethanol on a polycarbonate filter. Extracted and inoculated cell numbers were determined by fluorescence microscopy. The extraction efficiency of 18–80%, expressed as percentage of total count cell numbers, strongly depended inversely on the organic matter content. CLPP were obtained from all samples of cores A, D and G, and from a few selected samples of the remaining cores taken at the depth of the buried source. BiologTM EcoPlates (Biolog Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) [32] are commercially manufactured microtiter plates loaded with mineral medium, a tetrazolium dye and 31 different carbon sources in triplicates. CLPP are based on reduction of the dye linked to carbon source utilization in the wells of those plates [33]. None of the carbon sources is a fuel compound or expected to occur significantly in hydrocarbon-polluted soils due to contamination. By means of a 8-channel pipette, one plate per sample depth was inoculated with 125 μl per well of the 1:100 (topsoil) or 1:19 diluted extract. Plate incubation occurred at steady temperature of 21 °C in the dark, absorption was automatically measured at 595 nm every 12 h with a plate reader (Dynex Technologies Inc. MRX II, Chantilly, USA). Values of the respective blanks were subtracted and negative values that occasionally resulted were set to zero. Average well color development (AWCD) was calculated for each well but not used for further data transformation for reasons described in the results section. Values after 72 h incubation and absorbance areas under curves to 120 h were used for further analysis. The areas were obtained by calculating a ‘Riemann’s sum’ as also suggested in [34]. The substrate richness, S, is the total number of utilized C-sources out of 31 and utilization being ascribed to absorbance values of samples minus absorbance of blanks exceeding 0.25 after 72 h. A coefficient of variation (CV) was introduced in order to gain information on the reliability of the mean values of the three substrate replicates on one plate. The percentages of all 31 plate substrates with a CV=σ/μ (σ being the standard deviation and μ the mean value of the three replicates) smaller than 100% are listed in Table 3. The whole data set of 33 objects/samples was subdivided in five files according to the variables: ‘Biolog 72h’ (absorption after 72 h: 31 quantitative variables), ‘Biolog area 120h (areas under absorbance curves after 120 h: 31 quantitative variables), ‘Biology data’ (CO2 concentration log of cell numbers, protein quantification: 3 quantitative variables), ‘Soil parameters’ (depth, pH, temperature, Ntot, Ptot, total carbon, TOC and volumetric water content: 8 quantitative variables) and ‘Time’ (days after contamination, given as three binary variables). In order to quantify and test effects of various sets of explanatory variables on the Biolog and Biology data variation, RDA was applied using the CANOCO 3.12 software [35,36]. RDA is a canonical method that allows simultaneous analysis of two or more data tables. Like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), RDA is used to calculate ordination of samples, with the difference that in RDA the explanatory variables intervene in the ordination of the response variable matrix. The ordination vectors are forced to be maximally related to linear combinations of the explanatory variables [37] and the canonical model can be tested. Variables of the data matrix have been centered by CANOCO, those of the explanatory variables were standardized. A correlation matrix was used to map the various types of variables in the data matrix. During the analysis the most discriminating variables were selected by the ‘forward selection’ procedure of the program. Statistical tests were run using the Monte Carlo permutation procedure of CANOCO [38]. The same statistical package was used for preliminary PCA. Results from chemical soil analysis are presented in Table 2. The total organic carbon (TOC) content declined from 4–9 g kg−1 in topsoil to less than 1 g kg−1 in the vadose zone at 80–130 cm depth where the contamination was buried.
