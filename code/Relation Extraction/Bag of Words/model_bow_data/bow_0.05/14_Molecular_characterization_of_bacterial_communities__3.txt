Sterile controls were set up using the same bottles and volumes of sand particles and medium. They were autoclaved three times at intervals of at least 24 h. Then the medium was exchanged by fresh medium and the substrates were added at the concentrations given above. By default, growth was monitored by weekly determination of sulfide and substrate concentrations. Degradation rates were determined for the cultures used for terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses. For this purpose, sulfide and substrate concentrations were measured twice a week. When a substrate was completely degraded, it was replenished at the concentrations mentioned above. When the sulfide concentration exceeded 4 mM, the medium was removed and exchanged by fresh medium. The microcosms were incubated statically at 22 °C in the dark outside of the glove box. Chemical analyses Sulfide was determined spectrophotometrically according to Cline (1969) with the following modifications: samples (25–200 μL) were dissolved in 1 mL zinc acetate dihydrate solution (20 g L−1) for fixing sulfide immediately after sampling. Subsequently, 4 mL distilled water and 400 μL N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylendiammoniumdichloride (DMPD) were added. After a 20-min reaction time absorption values were measured. Concentrations were calculated using standards prepared from an anoxic sulfide stock solution. Benzene and toluene were analyzed by automated headspace GC using a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph (Varian, Palo Alto) equipped with a CP SIL 5 CB capillary column (film thickness, 0.12 μm; inside diameter, 0.25 mm; length, 25 m) and a flame ionization detector. The chromatographic conditions were as follows: injector temperature, 250 °C (split 1 : 50); detector temperature, 260 °C; and an oven temperature program consisting of 70 °C for 2 min, followed by an increase at a rate of 10 °C min−1 up to 90 °C and then followed by a further increase at a rate of 60 °C min−1 until 220 °C was reached. Helium (1 mL min−1) was used as a carrier gas. Liquid test samples (diluted 1 : 10 or 1 : 20 in 1.6 mM H2SO4; final volume, 10 mL) were prepared in 20-mL glass vials. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 70 °C in an agitator (rotation regime, 250 r.p.m. for 5 s and no rotation for 2 s) before analysis, and 1 mL of each sample's headspace was injected. For calibration, diluted standards of benzene and toluene prepared from stock solutions were treated in the same way as the samples. The stock solutions were prepared in pure methanol. Phenol and benzoate were analyzed by HPLC (Shimadzu) using a UV/VIS detector. Separation was performed at 23 °C and a flow rate of 0.6 mL min−1 using a Nucleosil 100 C18 column (3 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm size; Knauer GmbH, Berlin, Germany) as the stationary phase and a buffer containing 60% (v/v) NaH2PO4 (131.5 mM, pH 2.8) and 40% (v/v) acetonitrile as the liquid phase. Samples were prepared by centrifugation (10 min, 18 900 g, 4 °C) and diluted 10-fold in distilled water. Twenty microliters of each sample were injected. The compounds were detected at 271 nm wavelength. Thermodynamic calculations Changes in Gibbs free energy inline image were calculated from the data of Thauer et al. (1977). ΔGf 0298 values for benzene and benzoate were taken from Kaiser & Hanselmann (1982). DNA preparation, 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing DNA was extracted according to Maher et al.
