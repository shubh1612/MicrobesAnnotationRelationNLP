Thus, the ratio of lighter alkanes (C6 to C16) to heavier alkanes (C16 to C35) was used as a chemical proxy for the biodegradation process (59, 62). The ratio observed in oiled beach sands (0.025 to 0.16) was reduced by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared to the ratio observed in the DH source oil (2.79; see Table 3).

Detailed chemical analysis of hydrocarbon compounds from two oiled sand samples collected on 1 September 2010 from Pensacola Beach compared to source oil sampled on 20 May 2010 from MC block 252 after the DH blowout Enumeration of oil-degrading bacteria.In the same sand samples for which detailed chemical analysis was performed (Table 3), MPN counts of cultivatable hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in oil-contaminated sands (2.4 × 1010 cells ml−1) exceeded those from “clean” sands sampled in parallel by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude (2.4 × 106 to 9.3 × 106 cells ml−1). Enumeration of bacteria with quantitative molecular approaches corroborated cultivation-based evidence. rRNA gene abundances were determined for samples taken from all sampling trips, resulting in a data set of 468 sand samples. Counts of cultivatable hydrocarbon degraders paralleled the molecular quantification of bacterial rRNA gene abundance. In oiled sands that were analyzed for hydrocarbon content, bacterial rRNA gene abundance was ∼10 times higher in oiled (0.44 × 107 to 14.2 × 107 copies g−1) versus clean (0.024 × 107 to 1.57 × 107 copies g−1) sand. Alcanivorax spp. were not detected by qPCR methods in the clean sands used for MPN enumeration but were detected in Pensacola Beach sands without visible oil contamination. Alcanivorax were more abundant in sand samples with visible oil contamination (0.27 × 107 to 2.77 × 107 copies g−1) than in sands without visible oil contamination (0.12 × 105 to 8.9 × 105 copies g−1). Differences in total bacterial and Alcanivorax gene abundances between oiled and nonoiled sands are both statistically significant, as assessed by a Student t test on log-transformed data (P < 0.008). Principal component analysis was performed to investigate the effect of visible oil contamination and sampling date on bacterial abundances for the larger qPCR data set of 468 samples (Fig. 1). Total bacterial SSU rRNA gene abundance and Alcanivorax specific SSU rRNA gene abundance covaried and increased with respect to visible oil contamination (Fig. 1). The percent abundance of Alcanivorax did not covary with Alcanivorax SSU rRNA gene abundance. The percent abundance of Alcanivorax was strongly associated with oil presence in the earliest (2 July) sampling trip and weakly associated with oil contamination in the later trips. The first sampling trip was also characterized by a relatively small increase in total bacterial SSU rRNA gene abundance associated with oil contamination compared to later sampling trips. Linear regression analysis of the abundance of overall bacteria in comparison to the abundance of Alcanivorax spp. for each sampling trip supported observations from the principal component analysis (Fig. 2). During the July sampling trip, Alcanivorax spp. were most abundant and were shown to covary with the abundance of overall bacteria. In subsequent sampling trips, the abundance of Alcanivorax declined and did not strongly covary with overall bacterial abundance. Initially, the average percent composition of Alcanivorax gene copies comprised ca. 10% of the total bacterial gene copies, which fell to <1% in sampling trips after September 2010. Fig. 1.
