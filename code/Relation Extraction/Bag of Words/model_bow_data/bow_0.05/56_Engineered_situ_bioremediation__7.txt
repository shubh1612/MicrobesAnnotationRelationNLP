have been previously described as hydrocarbon-degraders [43]; [48]; [12]; [44] ; [17]. Remarkably, some Ochrobactrum species seemed to be the most abundant bacteria in crude oil [51], although, unlike in our results, it was not possible to isolate the bacterium in agar plates. The differences in the relative abundance of these bacterial genera may have to do with their metabolic capabilities, which act on specific carbon sources, as well as the chemical composition of the existing petroleum hydrocarbons during the different sampling periods [28]. It is of interest to note the five most frequently isolated species throughout the whole study in the different zones. Some of them, such as Pseudomonas putida and Acinetobacter sp., have been previously reported at many oil-contaminated sites [18]; [44]; [13] ; [41]. Microbacterium oxydans has been isolated in petroleum-contaminated tropical soils [42]. Achromobacter xylosoxidans has not been described in oil-contaminated soils, although it has been isolated in PAHs and toluidine-contaminated soils [22] ; [2]. Finally, Ochrobactrum anthropi has not been previously described in oil-contaminated soils with the exception of a recent report [51] in which, as in our work, this bacterium was often detected in the oily samples analyzed. After contamination of pristine soil with petroleum, an increase in microbial activity, but a decrease in microbial diversity, is generally observed [3]. These phenomena had conceivably already taken place in the subsoil studied here, given the long history of hydrocarbon pollution at the site. Despite this, a further reduction in diversity of the cultivable bacteria was observed (Table 1). This is probably due to the individual response of the bacteria to the carbon source depletion (Table 2). Communities can otherwise be expected to behave differently in places where spills are recent [14]. This study has provided data regarding the successful application of amendments (oleophilic fertilizer, surfactant, and hydrogen peroxide) to achieve in situ bioremediation at a hydrocarbon-polluted site. The identification of low dissolved oxygen levels and the limited bioavailability of the hydrocarbons indicated that the classic approach of providing additional nutrients should be complemented by adding the other two products. The effectiveness of the selected bioremediation strategy was particularly significant within the first two months of treatment, revealing the previous adaptation of the microbial populations due to their long-term exposure to leakages and spills. Moreover, the chemical analyses confirmed the disappearance of the contaminants and hence the effectiveness of the treatment. In-depth molecular studies are needed to fully understand the behavior of microbial communities during bioremediation in contaminated environments such the one presented.
