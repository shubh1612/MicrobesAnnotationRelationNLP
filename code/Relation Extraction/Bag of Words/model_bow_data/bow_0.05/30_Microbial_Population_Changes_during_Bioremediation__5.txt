They slowly declined in the oiled plots over the course of the next 14 weeks, and no significant differences were noted among the three oiled treatments (P > 0.05). The PAH degraders in the oiled plots increased by about 3 orders of magnitude within 2 weeks after the experiment was started, but they also slowly declined with time thereafter. Lipid analysis.Analysis of the PLFA profiles was carried out on replicate samples (n = 5) from all four treatments from weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, and 14. The PLFA contents for these samples ranged from a minimum of 239 ± 79 pmol per g for the unoiled plot (week 14) to a maximum of 19,974 ± 3,504 pmol per g for the nutrient-amended oiled plot at T 0 (Fig.1). Biomass content decreased over time in all treatments (P < 0.05). At weeks 0 and 2, the biomass measured on the nutrient-amended plots was significantly higher than those on the unoiled plots and the natural attenuation plots. For weeks 8 through 14, all oiled plots contained significantly more biomass (P < 0.05) than the unoiled plots (Fig. 1) on the basis of results determined by ANOVA. Community structure.The community structures of all oiled samples, measured by using PLFA analysis, shifted away from that of the unoiled (background) samples with time. The major difference in the PLFA profiles was that the microbial communities in the oiled samples contained significantly more monoenoic PLFA (specifically, 16:1ω7c, 18:1ω7c, 16:1ω7t, and 18:1ω7t [P < 0.05]), indicative of gram-negative bacteria (31, 37), than those in the unoiled samples. At all plots and for all treatments, the relative proportion of PLFAs indicative of eukaryote biomass (37), specifically, 18:1ω9c, 20:1ω9c, 20:0, and 22:1ω9c, decreased over time. This change in eukaryotic biomass coincided with the disappearance of horseshoe crab eggs that had been deposited in the sand during the mating season prior to experimental startup. A hierarchical cluster analysis of the PLFA profiles (arc sine-transformed mole percent data) showed the major trends within the data set (Fig. 2). Due to the presence of a high relative proportion of 18:1ω9c, all the samples from week 0 clustered together. The natural attenuation, nutrient-amended, and inoculum-amended plot samples from weeks 4 through 14 clustered according to time, as did the nutrient- and inoculum-amended samples from week 2. The profiles from the unoiled background plots (weeks 2 through 14) also clustered together (Fig. 2) but were separate from the oiled samples. A principal-component analysis (PCA) of the PLFA profiles showed similar results; i.e., all the week 0 treatments and the unoiled background samples from weeks 4 through 14 formed distinct clusters (Fig. 3A). Two principal components were derived that accounted for 92 and 6.6% of the variance inherent in the data set. The first principal component was influenced most strongly by 18:1ω9c and to a lesser extent 18:0 (eukaryote biomass) (Fig. 3B) (in this case most likely indicative of eukaryote [horseshoe crab egg] biomass) and accounted for the tight clustering of the week 0 samples. The second principal component was most strongly influenced by 18:1ω7c (indicative of gram-negative bacteria) (Fig. 3B) and to a lesser extent cy19:0 (again gram-negative bacteria). This second principal component accounted for the separation of the oiled samples from weeks 2 through 14 from the unoiled background samples. To investigate more fully the shifts within the microbial communities of the oiled samples compared to the background sample, PCA was used to analyze paired samples (i.e., unoiled versus oiled and unamended, unoiled versus oiled and nutrient-treated, and unoiled versus oiled and inoculated plots). The analyses comparing the PLFA profiles of the unoiled samples with those from each of the different treatments consistently revealed the same patterns. At week 0, the profiles clustered together; at week 2, a greater distance occurred between the oiled and unoiled sample profiles; by weeks 4 and 8, the oiled plot samples had separated from the background samples.
