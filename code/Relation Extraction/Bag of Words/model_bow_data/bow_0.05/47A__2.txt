The isolates were grouped to various genera as per Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (Holt et al., 1994). These cultures were characterised depending on their morphology, gram staining, spore staining, motility, oxidase, catalase, oxidation fermentation, gas production, ammonia formation, nitrate and nitrite reduction, indole production test, methyl-red and Voges-Proskauer test, citrate and mannitol utilisation test, hydrolysis of casein, gelatin, starch, urea and lipid (Aaranson 1970). The bacterial cultures isolated from oil spilled environment were inoculated in Mineral salts medium (Kennedy et al., 1975) with 1% Bombay High crude oil as carbon source. It was kept in the shaker at 200 rpm at 30 C for a period of seven days. The growth was recorded and categorized spectrophotometrically as low growth with optical density (OD) in the range 0.21-0.4, moderate growth (OD 0.41-0.6), high growth (OD 0.61-0.8) and excellent growth (OD 0.81-1.0) all measured at 620nm. The bacterial isolates that exhibited excellent growth on crude oil, Micrococcus sp. GS222, Bacillus sp. DS6-86, Corynebacterium sp. GS5-66, Flavobacterium sp. DS5-73 and Pseudomonas sp. DS10-129, were selected. A loopful of culture was inoculated into 100ml sterile nutrient broth. The flasks were incubated and shaken at 200 rpm, for 12h at 30 C. One ml volumes of the culture broth from each of the above five isolates were mixed to prepare mixed bacterial consortium. Individual bacterial cultures and bacterial consortium (1.0 %) were transferred to 250 ml conical flasks, each containing 100 ml of sterile defined mineral salts medium with 1% Bombay High (BH) crude oil. An uninoculated control was also studied concurrently. The flasks were incubated at 30 C and shaken at 200 rpm for 20 days. At 2-day intervals, a set of flasks was used for the enumeration of microbial population and estimation of crude oil content Spectrophotometrically as described in Rahman et al. (2002). Degradation was estimated as difference between the initial and final concentration of the oil content in the medium. Effect of environmental factors on the growth and degradation of BH crude oil The effect of pH (6.5, 7.5 and 8.5), temperature (15 C, 20 C and 30 C) on the bacterial growth and degradation of 1% crude oil were studied by using mineral salts medium with BH crude oil. he highest microbial population was observed for the sample GS-5. The bacterial, fungal and actinomycetes populations were recorded as 3.0 x 106 CFU g-1, 8.9 x 104 and 4.3 x 104 CFU g-1 respectively (Table 1). In gasoline station soil, the maximum (2.98 mg g-1) and minimum (0.56 mg g-1) oil contents were recorded for samples GS-5 and GS-7. The bacterial count in diesel station soil samples ranged between 3.0 x 105 CFU g-1 for sample DS-1 and 2.1 x 108 CFU g-1 for sample DS-9. Among the diesel station soil samples the maximum fungal and actinomycetes populations were observed for sample DS-9 with 7.0 x 104 CFU g-1 and 4.7 x 104 CFU g-1 respectively. In diesel station soil, the maximum of 5.21 mg g-1 oil content was noticed in sample DS-9 and minimum of 1.65 mg g-1 in sample DS-7. The physiological activities of the bacterial isolates were studied and the results were presented as percentage of bacterial isolates exhibiting the enzymatic activity (Figure 3). For gasoline station soil, very high number of amylolytic bacteria were found (66.4%) followed by lipolytic (49.4%), caseinolytic (47.8%), gelatinolytic (35.6%) and the least were urea hydrolysers (19.3%). Lipolytic bacteria were more (72.4%) followed by caseinolytic (54.2%), amylolytic (49.6%), gelatinolytic (25.1%) and the least were ureolytic (11.1%) for diesel station soil.
