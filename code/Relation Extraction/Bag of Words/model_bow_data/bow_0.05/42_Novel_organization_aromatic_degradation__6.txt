5F10 contains four tRNA genes (for Pro, Arg, His and Lys), indicating that this DNA fragment is most probably of chromosomal origin (Figure 1). EDOs belonging to subfamily I.2.B are frequently identified in the genus Sphingomonas. They include catechol 2,3-dioxygenases, involved in the degradation of single-ring aromatic compounds (for example, xylenes) (Eltis and Bolin, 1996). I.2.B EDO genes were borne on four fosmids, three of which (4D5, 1A9 and 6F5) had nearly an identical sequence; with the exception that 4D5 carried two I.2.B EDO genes (ORF4D5-30 and −31) (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). The deduced amino acid sequences of the ORF4D5-10 to −17 gene products are 37–70% identical to those of proteins involved in the degradation of phenol (DmpQBCEFGH of pVI150) and aniline (TdnD2C2-Orf4 product-TdnEGIJK of pTDN1 from P. putida UCC2) (Figure 1). However, no genes for putative phenol hydroxylase homologs were identified in the flanking regions, suggesting that the degradation gene cluster in 4D5 constitutes only part of a complete degradative pathway and is likely to work in concert with other upstream enzyme genes, which might be located at a distant locus in the same genome or provided by other organisms. Fosmid 10D8 carries seven ORFs, ORF10D8-21, −22, −23, −26, −27, −28, −30, which encode polypeptides calculated to be 37–70% identical to the gene products of dmpBCEHFGD of pVI150 and tdnC2-Orf4-tdnEGKIJF of pTDN1 (Figure 1). ORF10D8-24 was predicted to be a GntR-type transcriptional regulator. Unlike other well-studied meta-pathway gene clusters, this putative regulator gene is positioned in the middle of the degradation gene cluster. Fosmids carrying I.2.C EDO genes  The EDOs of subfamily I.2.C are primarily catechol 2,3-dioxygenases responsible for the degradation of single-ring aromatic compounds (for example, phenol, nitrobenzene and aniline). This type of EDO is often found in β-Proteobacteria (Comamonas, Ralstonia and Burkholderia) and γ-Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas) (Eltis and Bolin, 1996). I.2.C EDO genes were found in all three of our metagenomic fosmid clones (3F10, 9C3 and 7D12). The pTDN1-specified genes in the aniline-degrading meta-cleavage pathway constitute the operon tdnD1C(orf123)D2C2(orf4)EFGHIJKL (Fukumori and Saint, 2001) (Figure 3). Most of the deduced proteins encoded by ORF3F10-1 to −16 show extremely high amino acid identity (>94%) with these Tdn proteins (Figures 1 and 3). As is the case for pTDN1, 3F10 has two genes each for catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (ORF3F10-2 and −6) and ferredoxin (ORF3F10-1 and −5). The deduced amino acid sequences of ORF9C3-19 to −35 are 54–100% identical to those of proteins encoded by pTDN1 (Figures 1 and 3). Unlike 3F10, the 9C3 fosmid contains single copies of the genes for catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and ferredoxin. To examine the activities of the ORF9C3-28 to −35 gene products, the gene cluster was subcloned into pUC18. E. coli JM109 cells carrying the recombinant plasmid produced 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (detected by yellow coloration) on LB agar plates containing aniline, confirming the activities of aniline dioxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase. The aniline-catabolizing gene cluster on pTDN1 is flanked by IS1071 (Fukumori and Saint, 2001). IS1071 is preferentially located on broad host-range IncP-1β plasmids and can transpose in β-proteobacterial strains with high frequency (Sota et al., 2006b). Downstream of the degradation gene cluster on 9C3, two truncated IS1071 transposase genes (ORF9C3-3 and −14) flank a complete set of mercury-resistance genes, merRTPCADE (ORF9C3-4 to 10) (Figure 1). Because IncP-1β plasmids often carry mercury-resistance genes flanked by IS1071, the insert in 9C3 might have originated from an IncP-1β plasmid of β-proteobacterial origin, which is consistent with the SOM analysis result. Four fosmids (7D12, 4E8, 6H11 and 9E5) had overlapping sequences (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). The deduced products of ORF7D12-39 to −44 show amino acid sequence identities of 71–83% with those of OrfX (unknown function), AphB (2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase), AphQ (unknown function), AphP (reductase component of phenol hydroxylase), AphO (hydroxylase component of phenol hydroxylase) and AphN (hydroxylase component of phenol hydroxylase) of the phenol-utilizing strain Comamonas testosteroni TA441 (Arai et al., 2000); these levels of identity are higher than those found for the DmpOPQB products of pVI150, which exhibit only 33–58% identity with these proteins. Fosmid 7D12 contained two genes for ribosomal proteins, L13 (RplM, ORF7D12-15) and S9 (RpsI, ORF7D12-16); L13 and S9 are 90% and 87% identical, respectively, to a ribosomal protein of Acidvorax sp. JS42, indicating that this DNA fragment must have originated from a β-proteobacterial chromosome (Figure 1). ORF7D12-17, a putative gene (int) for tyrosine recombinase-type integrase that has highly conserved functional homologs in the Tn4371-like genomic islands (Toussaint et al., 2003), was located downstream of rplM. Likewise, the deduced amino acid sequences of the ORF7D12-26, −34, −35 and −38 gene products show 90% identity with those of ParB, RepA, ParA and TraF, respectively, of the Tn4371-like islands.
