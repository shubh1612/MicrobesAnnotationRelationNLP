The predicted 524 bp PCR products were successfully amplified from genomic DNA of B. xenovorans LB400 and Rhodococcus sp. RHA1, both of which carry target dioxygenase genes, and not from genomic DNA of Sphingomonas wittichii RW1, which carries dioxin dioxygenase, which was not used for primer design. Pyrosequencing statistics As the average sequence length produced by the Genome Sequencer FLX System is around 200–250 bp (Rothberg and Leamon, 2008), we sequenced the same pool of PCR products from both 5′ (BPHD-f3 sequences) and 3′ ends (BPHD-r1 sequences) (Table 1). Although the concentration of the sequenced PCR products for BPHD-f3 and BPHD-r1 was almost the same, the number of obtained sequences differed almost threefold, possibly because of the different efficiency of emulsion PCR caused by the different primer sequences attached to the adapter. Primer-trimmed sequence length varied from 28 to 293 bp. Out of over 3000 sequences, we determined 2632 sequences (79.3%) as obtained sequences for further analysis on the basis of our position of error and frameshift analysis. The rarefaction curves at 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 clustering distances are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Table 1 - Pyrosequencing information.

Overall patterns of conservation indicated by negative peaks of H′ are similar between obtained sequences and reference sequences (Figure 1). Seven and eight highlighted residues in BPHD-f3 and BPHD-r1 alignments, respectively, were identical among >95% of either obtained sequences or reference sequences (Figure 1). 230D, 232Y, 233H, 239H, 271G, 328P, 344P and 351E, which were conserved among >80% of reference sequences, were also highly conserved among >98% of obtained sequences. On the contrary, 241S and 272H in BPHD-f3 alignment and 327F, 346G, 347P, 353W and 385E in BPHD-r1 alignment were highly conserved among obtained sequences, but they were poorly conserved among reference sequences (29.6–59.3% of reference sequences). On the basis of the crystal structure study, 241S, 353W and 385E are located on α-helix 8, β-strand 19 and α-helix 14, respectively. None of the seven residues, except 241S, is a part of the active site, interface residues or substrate-binding pocket (Furusawa et al., 2004). We validated our obtained sequences using conserved residues. The highly conserved 230D, 233H and 239H (Figure 1a) are located in fragments forming the substrate-binding pocket (Furusawa et al., 2004). 233H and 239H have been reported as residues to coordinate the mononuclear iron of Rieske nonheme iron dioxygenase, and 230D acts as a bridge connecting the two iron sites, 123H and 233H (Furusawa et al., 2004; Dong et al., 2005). There are 24 sequences (1.2% of the obtained sequences of BPHD-f3) that did not have one or more of those three residues, indicating that they were possible nonfunctional dioxygenase genes. Seventeen of them showed similarity with E-values of <10−4 to putative dioxygenase genes from environmental samples by BLASTX. The rest of the sequences either showed similarity to nondioxygenase genes or less similarity (E-value of >10−4) to any of the genes in the database. As those sequences were missing functionally important residues, they could be caused by nonspecific PCR amplification or evolutionary degeneracies in nature. For the BPHD-r1 side, as we could not find any common structural information of the protein for this region among Rieske nonheme iron dioxygenase genes, we used highly conserved 344P (Figure 1b) for the validation of sequences. Four sequences (0.7% of the obtained sequences of BPHD-r1) did not have this conserved residue. All of them showed similarity with E-values of <10−4 to putative dioxygenase genes from environmental samples by BLASTX. We excluded those 24 and 4 sequences that did not have the highly conserved and functionally important residues from further clustering and distribution analysis. Of the remaining 2604 sequences, which we termed as valid, 2075 sequences (80%) have the highest BLASTX hits to dioxygenase genes (either cultured or environmental), with E-values of <10−4. The remaining 529 sequences (521 sequences from BPHD-f3 and 8 sequences from BPHD-r1) have no hits with E-values of <10−4 to any of the sequences in the database.
