It is well established that PCR-DGGE as applied can detect microorganisms which represent only 1 to 2% of the target group (19, 28). Therefore, the method used is incapable of detecting minor community components that may be essential in the degradation of specific hydrocarbon classes. When the plots treated by addition of nutrients and those treated by addition of nutrients and a hydrocarbon-degrading inoculum derived from the same site were compared, no differences in the rate of bioremediation of crude oil or community structure as determined by either PLFA, PCR-DGGE, or MPN analysis were detected. In an attempt to explain this, PCR-DGGE was used to compare the bacterial community structures of the inoculum with those of the plot to which it was added. Although the results are not definitive, few if any of the bands recovered from the inoculum comigrated with any of the visible bands recovered from the inoculation plots, indicating that the inoculated bacteria did not compete favorably with the indigenous bacterial community, even though they were originally derived from a nearby beach. This may be one explanation for the ineffectiveness of the inoculum. Another explanation would be the relatively low numbers of degraders present in the inoculum to begin with. The density of viable alkane and PAH degraders in the drums as measured by MPN techniques was approximately 1.9 × 105 ml−1 and 2.5 × 104 ml−1, respectively (33). For bioaugmentation to be a viable bioremediation technology, the inoculum size should be at least equal to if not greater than the indigenous population (13) after inoculation.
