1976) and deep degradation results in the formation of methylphloroglucinol and p-cresol (Funk et al. 1993). Enrichment cultures could be obtained in anaerobic conditions which converted dinoseb to acetic acid (Stevens et al. 1991). Dinoseb was also successfully eliminated by anaerobic soil bioremediation (Kaake et al. 1992). As more and more nitro groups are placed on the ring, the increasing electrophilic character of the molecule contributes to increasing rates of reduction as shown in Figure 4 for cell-free-extracts of the anaerobe, Veillonella alcalescens (McCormick et al. 1976). Nonetheless, most mono-nitro aromatics, including nitrotoluene and nitrobenzene, are reliably converted to their corresponding aromatic amines in anaerobic sludge or anaerobically incubated sewage (Dickel et al. 1993; Hallas & Alexander 1983; O'Connor & Young 1993) as well as in pure cultures of strict anaerobes (Gorontzy et al. 1993). Lysed cells and cell free extracts of methanogens were also able to carry out this reduction (Gorontzy et al. 1993). Both 2- and 4-nitrophenol are mineralized in methanogenic sludge (Battersby &Wilson 1989; Boyd et al. 1983; O'Connor & Young 1993; Shelton & Tiedje 1984) as well as 2- nitrobenzoate (Horowitz et al. 1981). Aerobes. The azo dyes, which comprise the most important family of compounds used as textile dyes, have been found to be quite recalcitrant to aerobic biodegradation. The highly electrophilic azo bond must be cleaved for dye decolorization to take place. Decolorization of the dyes does not readily occur in aerobic activated sludge (Pagga & Brown 1986; Shaul et al. 1991). Of more than 100 dyes tested, only a very few were actually biodegraded. Isolated aerobic bacteria were also not able to degrade azo dyes when incubated aerobically (Haug et al. 1991; Wuhrmann et al. 1980). In special cases, aerobic bacterial isolates were able to adapt to the cleavage of carboxylated azo dyes after 100 to 400 generations (Kulla 1981). These isolates were shown to possess O2-tolerant azoreductases with narrow substrate spectra (Zimmermann et al. 1984). Anaerobes.
