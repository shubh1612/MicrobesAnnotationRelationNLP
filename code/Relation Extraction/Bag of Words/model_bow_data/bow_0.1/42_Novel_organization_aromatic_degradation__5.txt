The details are described in the Supplementary information and in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4. The genetic organization of representative fosmid inserts is depicted in Figure 1, and the details of the ORFs for all fosmid inserts are shown in Supplementary Figures S1, S2 and S3. Most EDO genes were flanked by genes or gene clusters predicted to be involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds. These gene products showed moderate to significant levels of identity with well-studied catabolic enzymes from isolated bacteria; these enzymes included Dmp proteins from the phenol-catabolizing plasmid pVI150 of Pseudomonas sp. CF600 (Shingler et al., 1992), Phe proteins from the phenol-utilizing strain Bacillus thermoglucosidasius A7 (Duffner et al., 2000), Tdn proteins from the aniline-catabolizing plasmid pTDN1 of P. putida UCC22 (Fukumori and Saint, 2001), Nah proteins from the naphthalene-catabolizing plasmid NAH7 of P. putida G7 (Sota et al., 2006a) and Nag proteins from the naphthalene-utilizing strain Ralstonia sp. U2 (Zhou et al., 2001). Schematic drawings of these pathways are shown in Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5. Notably, (i) these known aromatics degraders generally carry one or two well-organized gene clusters that allow the complete degradation of aromatic compounds to pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, and (ii) the gene clusters are usually arranged according to the order of the reactions. We refer to these representative pathways identified in isolates in discussing the properties of our fosmid fragments below. A representative EDO belonging to the I.2.A subfamily is catechol 2,3-dioxygenase. I.2.A EDOs are frequently found in Pseudomonas spp. and are involved in the degradation of single-ring aromatic compounds (for example, phenol and toluene) and naphthalene (Eltis and Bolin, 1996). The first step in bacterial phenol degradation is, in most cases, monohydroxylation of phenol at the ortho-position to form catechol. This reaction is performed by a phenol hydroxylase comprising a single component (such as PheA from B. stearothermophilus BR219 (Kim and Oriel, 1995)), two components (such as PheAB from B. thermoglucosidasius A7 (Duffner et al., 2000)), or multiple components (such as DmpKLMNOP from pVI150 (Shingler et al., 1992)) (Figures 2 and 5). Plasmid pVI150 carries a catabolic dmp operon containing 15 structural genes that encode a multicomponent-type phenol hydroxylase (DmpKLMNOP) and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (DmpB). The complete degradation of the 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde formed by the DmpB reaction is carried out by the enzymes encoded by dmpCDEHFGI. Among our metagenomic fosmid inserts, I.2.A EDO genes were found in five fosmids that were classified into three subtypes (2C5, 3A2 and 5F10) depending on their genetic organization (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). The fosmid 2C5 appears to contain dmpKLMNOPQBCDEHFGI, a complete gene cluster comprising ORF2C5-7 to −13 and ORF2C5-15 to −22; this cluster encodes polypeptides calculated to be 20–78% identical to the Dmp proteins of pVI150 (Figures 1 and 2). Upstream of this gene cluster is ORF2C5-23, which encodes a deduced polypeptide that is 61% identical to pVI150-encoded DmpR, a positive transcriptional regulator of the dmp operon (Figure 2). When the ORF2C5-15 to −22 cluster, presumably encoding phenol hydroxylase and EDO, was subcloned into pUC18, E. coli JM109 cells carrying the recombinant plasmid produced 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (detected by yellow coloration) on LB agar plates containing phenol, confirming the activities of the two enzymes. The predicted products of ORF3A2-1, −3, −5 and −15 to −20 from fosmid 3A2 are 35–79% identical to two components of phenol hydroxylase (DmpOP) (ORF3A2-1 and −3), catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (DmpB) (ORF3A2-5) and the DmpCDEFGH proteins (ORF3A2-15 to −20) of pVI150 (Figure 1). The deduced gene product of ORF3A2-14, which was located upstream of dmpCDEFGH, is 43% identical to the Orf0 protein, a GntR-type transcriptional regulator of the biphenyl-catabolizing (bph) operon of P. pseudoalcaligenes KF707 (Watanabe et al., 2000). Fosmid types 3A2 and 2C5 differ remarkably in that the two dmp gene clusters in 3A2 are separated by an intervening 10-kb sequence that does not appear to be involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds. Therefore, the 3A2-type gene cluster may be an evolutionarily intermediate form of the 2C5-type complete operon. On the other hand, some other dmp genes may be located upstream of ORF3A2-1. Fosmids 5F10, 2H2 and 9B1 have some DNA fragments in common (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). The nucleotide sequence of ORF5F10-3-encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase is identical to those of ORF26 in 6B9 (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S2) and ORF36 in 9E4 (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S3). The deduced gene products for ORF5F10-3, −5 and −6 show 56%, 60% and 66% identity to DmpB, DmpC and DmpE, respectively, of pVI150. In these fosmids, only these three ORFs were predicted to be involved in aromatics degradation.
