The largest changes seen in the Biolog CLPPs were caused by incubation rather than diesel contamination. It is likely that soil microcosm studies, which, of necessity, use disturbed soils under artificial conditions, are not representative of in situ effects. Future work using Biolog CLPPs to investigate oil remediation would be best carried out with contaminated field sites.
