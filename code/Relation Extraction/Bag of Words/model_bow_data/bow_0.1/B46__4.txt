Comparing the treatment systems employing more than one pure culture inoculum, system 13, constituted of B. cepacia, P. alcaligenes and P. putida, showed clearly the best degradation percentile results of gasoline components from n-undecane to n-tridecane and a decrease in the cell density. The low cellular density does not imply that a compound can not be cometabolized or syntrophicaly utilized. It is possible to suppose also that the increase of a specific population has caused an imbalance in the community through the competition for the physical space, nutrients and water, reducing to small levels the population of microorganisms that had the best performance in the biodegradation process. The survival might be indeed affected by inoculum size. The ability of the inoculum to survive was checked by comparing bacterial counts in both inoculated and uninoculated samples. Systems constituted of inoculum of K. pneumoniae were discarded because it is a pathogenic agent. Therefore, it is not appropriate to perform a bioaugmentation process with this microorganism. The results of this work allow to conclude that the tested native soil microflora (system 1) and the treatment system constituted of B. cepacia, P. alcaligenes and P. putida inoculum (system 13), after addition of NH4NO3 in the concentration of 30 Âµmol/g of soil and 0,1 mM of H2O2, presented high potential to degrade gasoline in treatments after leakage into soils. It is important to emphasize that for an in-situ treatment a detailed evaluation of the microbial population available locally and the required nutrients is necessary, as well as the treatment time necessary for an efficient remediation technology.
