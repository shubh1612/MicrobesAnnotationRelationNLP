Functional analysis of the “metabolism of aromatic compounds” subsystem provided additional evidence of a greater potential for anaerobic metabolism in the two samples nearest the DWH rig compared to the more distant sample (Figure ​Figure5B5B). GoM315 (located 0.5 km from the DWH rig) exhibited the highest percentage (15%) of anaerobic degradation genes for aromatic compounds, while GoM023 (located 128 km from the DWH rig) exhibited the lowest (9.9%). Notably, the metagenomics data revealed bssA in GoM315 only, the sample closest to the DWH well, and the complete complement (subunits D–G) of benzoyl-CoA reductase genes (Egland et al., 1997) was detected in GoM315 and GoM278, but not GoM023, the site farthest from the DWH well. CLONE LIBRARIES Functional gene libraries supported the metagenomic analysis and also suggested a greater genetic potential for anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation at the two sites near the DWH well, with respect to the assA and bssA genes. The assA and bssA genes encode the catalytic subunits of the glycyl radical enzymes, ASS, MAS; Callaghan et al., 2008; Grundmann et al., 2008) and BSS; Leuthner et al., 1998), respectively. Based on previous studies, ASS/MAS presumably catalyzes the addition of n-alkanes to fumarate (Callaghan et al., 2008; Grundmann et al., 2008) to form methylalkylsuccinic acids (for review see Widdel and Grundmann, 2010), whereas BSS catalyzes the addition of aromatic hydrocarbons to fumarate to yield benzylsuccinic acids and benzylsuccinate derivatives (for review see Boll and Heider, 2010). Both assA and bssA have been used as biomarkers, in conjunction with metabolite profiling, as evidence of in situ aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation (Beller et al., 2008; Callaghan et al., 2010; Yagi et al., 2010; Oka et al., 2011; Wawrik et al., 2012). Of the nine primer sets tested (Callaghan et al., 2010), primer set 2 (specific to bssA) yielded four bssA OTUs in GoM278 sediment and four bssA OTUs in GoM315 sediment (Figure ​Figure66). Primer set 7 (specific to assA) yielded eight assA OTUs in GoM278 and eight assA OTUs in GoM315 (Figure ​Figure77). A comparison of the bssA and assA OTU sequences revealed that there are unique and shared OTUs between the two sites. Sequence identities ranged from 68.8 to 100% and 63.7 to 100% for bssA and assA, respectively. Based on BlastX and BlastN, the GoM bssA clone sequences were similar to those from uncultured bacteria as well as to bssA in Thauera aromatica K172 and Azoarcus sp. T (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). Based on BlastX and BlastN, the GoM assA clone sequences were similar to those from uncultured bacteria, as well as to masD in “Aromatoleum” sp. HxN1 (Table S2 in Supplementary Material). The assA and bssA genes were not detected in sediment collected from the background site, GoM023, under the PCR conditions and primers tested in this study. METABOLITE PROFILING We specifically looked for the presence of alkylsuccinate derivatives that were presumed metabolites formed by the addition of hydrocarbon substrates across the double bond of fumarate (Biegert et al., 1996; Kropp et al., 2000; Elshahed et al., 2001; Gieg and Suflita, 2005). For example, the presence of benzyl- or alkyl-succinic acids indicates the anaerobic metabolic decay of alkylated aromatic or n-alkane hydrocarbons, respectively (Davidova et al., 2005; Duncan et al., 2009; Parisi et al., 2009). Straight chain alkanes and alkenes with carbon lengths from C11 to C14 and from C13 to C22, respectively, were detected using GC/MS in the two sites closest to the spill site (GoM278 and GoM315). A few branched alkanes and alkenes were also observed. n-Alkane and n-alkene hydrocarbons were not detected in the background sample (GoM023). With GC/MS, alkanoic acids in GoM278 (2.7 km) with lengths between C14 and C18 were detected, whereas the lengths ranged from C7 to C22 in GoM315 (0.5 km). Alkylsuccinate or alkylmalonate metabolites typically associated with the anaerobic biodegradation of n-alkanes via “fumarate addition” were below detection levels in all samples. However, putative benzylsuccinates were identified in the samples, based on their metastable fragmentation pattern of ≈5% loss of CO2 and no detectable loss of H2O in MS mode. The highest abundances were observed for C16 to C19 benzylsuccinates (Figure ​Figure88), and their abundances were also three times higher in GoM315 (0.5 km) than in the other two samples. The presence of benzylsuccinates is consistent with the detection of bssA genotypes. Benzoate, a central metabolite of both aerobic and anaerobic hydrocarbon metabolism, was also detected in the two samples closest to the spill site. COMPARATIVE METAGENOMICS Comparison of our metagenomic data to that of two other deep-sea metagenomes revealed a number of interesting differences. The first metagenomic study examined deep-subsurface sediment cores (PM01*, PM01, PM50) from the nutrient-rich area of the Peru Margin (Biddle et al., 2008), while the second examined an oligotrophic subsurface sediment core from the Gulf of Mexico (BT Basin) prior to the DWH blowout (Biddle et al., 2011).
