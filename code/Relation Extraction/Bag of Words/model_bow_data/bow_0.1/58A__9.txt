Heptachlorinated dioxin was dechlorinated to hexa- and pentachlorodibenzo(p)dioxins in river and aquifer sediments (Adriaens & Grbic-Galic 1992). Methanogenic enrichment cultures, acclimatized to the dechlorination of hexachlorobenzene, were able to convert 1,2,3,4- tetrachlorodibenzo(p)dioxin to tri-, di- and even monochlorinated dioxins (Toussaint et al. 1992). DDT which was also recalcitrant in aerobic environments, could be metabolized to lower chlorinated metabolites in anaerobic incubations of sewage sludge or soil (Castro & Toshida 1971; Pfaender & Alexander 1972). Like the polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated phenols are readily biodegraded in anaerobic conditions. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) has been shown in several studies to be reliably eliminated in continuous anaerobic upward-flow sludge blanket reactors with granular biofilms (Hendriksen & Ahring 1993; Wu et al. 1993). Specific activities of up to 15 mg PCP g-i volatile suspended solids d -I have been observed (Wu et al. 1993). In these studies, 14C-PCP was mineralized to radiolabelled CO2 and CH4. However, when digested anaerobic domestic sludge (DADS) was used as the inoculure, PCP was not fully mineralized (Hendriksen & Ahring 1993; Madsen & Aamand 1991; Mikesell & Boyd 1988). Meta- and para-substituted tri-, di- and mono-chlorophenols accumulated, in agreement with the fact that DADS is typically only naturally acclimatized to ortho-dechlorination (Boyd & R 1984; Hrudey et al. 1987; Shelton & Tiedje 1984). Ortho dechlorination was shown to be the most favorable reduction expected, based on the electrochemical characteristics of chlorophenol molecules (Cozza & Woods 1992). Significant mineralization of PCP occurred when a mixture of DADS was used that was composed of sludges which were individually acclimatized for two years to each of the three mono-chlorophenol isomers (Mikesell & Boyd 1986). This result indicates that several specific dechlorinating microorganisms were involved in the total biodegradation of PCR The selection pressure may not always enrich all of the dechlorinators required for complete chlorophenol dechlorination and subsequent mineralization. Anaerobic studies conducted with either trichlorophenols or mixtures of chlorophenols have generally resulted in partial degradation with concomitant accumulation of 3,4-dichlorophenol, 3,5-dichlorophenol, 3- chlorophenol and/or 4-chlorophenol (Kafkewitz et al. 1992; Mohn & Kennedy 1992; Woods et aI. 1989). In contrast, 2,6-dichlorophenol and 2-chlorophenol are intermediates which are reliably mineralized, indicating the facile dominance of ortho-dechlorinators. In a similar fashion, chlorinated veratroles, guaiacols and catechols are only partially degraded with accumulation of 3,4-dichlorocatechol, 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 3- chlorocatechol and/or 4-chlorocatechol (Allard et al. 1991; Neilson et al. 1987; Woods et al. 1989). Sulfate is reported to inhibit dechlorination of chlorophenols in methanogenic consortia (Gibson & Sulfita 1990; Madsen & Aamand 1991; Mohn & Kennedy 1992). Sulfate reduction apparently outcompetes dechlorination in the uptake of interspecies H2 as an electron-donor (Madsen & Aamand 1991). Aside from simple chloroaromatic compounds, the chlorinated lignin fragments in chlorine bleaching wastewaters are also subject to reductive dechlorination (Ferguson 1994; Fitzsimons et al. 1990). Since many of the fragments have a size in excess of cell penetration, it appears that the reducing conditions prevailing in the anaerobic environment can cause chemical dechlorination (Fitzsimons et al.
