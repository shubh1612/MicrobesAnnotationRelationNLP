The PHYLIP package [32] was used to generate phylogenetic trees. Distance matrices were produced using the DNADIST program and unrooted phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method of Felsenstein [32] in the NEIGHBOR program. Bootstrapping with the SEQBOOT program was then employed to determine the statistical significance of the groupings. Sequences which demonstrated uncertain alignments were checked for chimeras using the Chimera function at the RDP site. Sequences were submitted to GenBank and assigned accession numbers AF143747–AF143770. Dendrogram analysis of DGGE banding patterns was performed using the Dendron 2.2 software package (Solltech Inc., Oakdale, LA, USA). The dendrogram was created using unweighted pair groupings of a similarity coefficient (SAB) matrix. The stability of the resulting dendrogram was tested by randomizing the sample order 100 times and recalculating the dendrogram with 95% background noise. 2.4CLPP analysis Ten-fold dilutions used for bacterial enumeration were used to inoculate Biolog GN plates (150 μl per well) and incubated at 10°C. The plates were read every 12 h (OD590) for the first 48 h, and then readings were taken every 24 h for the remainder of the incubation. All wells were blanked to the water control well A1. The rate of substrate oxidation by each sample for individual carbon sources was calculated as the first linear portion of the plotted curve change in OD590 over time [33]. Rates were analyzed by cluster analysis using the statistical program Minitab (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA). 3Results 3.1Site characterization Chemical analysis of the samples (Table 1) revealed that the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) contamination levels varied from <100–200 ppm (uncontaminated sites) to 26 900 ppm (heavily contaminated). Samples from Alert, which were contaminated primarily by jet and diesel fuels, possessed similar total carbon and total nitrogen levels, despite the large range of petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations present at the sites. The total carbon and total nitrogen values from the Kuujjuaq sites differed significantly between the K1 and K2 sites and the K3 and K4 sites. The K1 and K2 samples came from a sandy area contaminated with jet fuel whereas the K3 and K4 samples originated from adjacent non-impacted areas. Despite the contamination of the K1 and K2 samples, the total carbon measured was still 10–15 times lower than in the K3 and K4 samples. The total nitrogen in the samples was also 10-fold lower in the K1 and K2 soils than in the K3 and K4 soils. The ratio of total carbon to total nitrogen (C:N) in the Kuujjuaq samples were all very similar (22.1–31.0) suggesting a balanced C:N ratio. The Alert samples by contrast were somewhat nitrogen-deficient based on the observed C:N ratios (50.5–214.0). To provide an indication of the relative abundance of total heterotrophic cold-adapted microorganisms present in each soil, a viable plate count was performed on nutrient-limited medium. The culturable counts, determined at 5°C, ranged from 106 to 108 CFU g soil−1 (Table 1). The levels of contamination present at the Alert and Kuujjuaq sites did not negatively affect the viable microbial population levels. Differences within the Kuujjuaq samples were only one order of magnitude (106–107), with the highest counts originating from sample K1 (600 ppm TPH). The uncontaminated Alert sites Ac and A2 demonstrated one to two orders of magnitude lower total heterotroph counts (106–107) versus the contaminated sites A3 and A1 (107–108). 3.2DGGE analysis The expected 500-bp PCR product specified by the bacterial 16S rDNA primers was amplified in all of the soils. Separation of these fragments by DGGE produced distinct and reproducible patterns comprising 20–35 distinct bands for each of the soil samples (Fig. 1).
