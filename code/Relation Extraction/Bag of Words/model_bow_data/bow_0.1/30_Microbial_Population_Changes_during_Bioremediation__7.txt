Dw15 may also have been abundant in unoiled plots but may have been obscured by the comigrating band Dw4. The sequence of the single band Dw19 could not be placed firmly within any established bacterial grouping. Five other novel bands, with relationship to microorganisms of the gram-negative α subgroup of the proteobacteria, were recovered only from oiled plots (Dw14, Dw16, Dw17, Dw20 and Dw21). No sequences indicative of the presence of α-proteobacteria were recovered from unoiled plots at any time point. Fig. 6C shows the patterns derived from all sample plots at week 14. No novel bands had appeared in the background samples, compared to those from week 8, and all bands sequenced were identical to those recovered at week 8 (Fig. 7). A single novel band loosely related to the genus Sphingomonasin the α-subgroup proteobacteria was detected uniquely in one oil-only control plot (Dw10). Two novel bands appeared as minor components of the banding patterns derived from all replicates of all plots treated with nutrients, irrespective of the addition of inocula (Dw8 and Dw9). These represented two closely related sequences within the gram-negative Flexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides phylum; it might be significant that these two bands did not appear in any of the natural attenuation plots, but the contribution of these species to the enhanced bioremediation of hydrocarbons remains speculative. Although PLFA analysis suggested the presence of actinomycetes and sulfate-reducing bacteria, no sequences related to cultured members of either group were recovered from any sample plot, indicating that both groups were present below PCR-DGGE detection levels as applied. PCR-DGGE analysis of the enrichment culture inoculum.PCR-DGGE comparison of the bacterial communities of the enrichment inoculum with the bacterial communities recovered from those test plots at week 14 showed little commonality in banding pattern (Fig.8). Only a single band, comigrating with Dw20, was common to the inoculum and the inoculated plots, but this band was also common to uninoculated plots. Thus, PCR-DGGE did not suggest that any part of the inoculum had become established as detectable components of the bacterial community. The results of PCR-DGGE analysis coupled with band excision and sequence analysis were in good agreement with the PLFA analysis as it applied to the bacterial community. DGGE analysis suggested that the bacterial communities of the unoiled plots were dominated by gram-positive microorganisms during the 14-week study. The bacterial community structures revealed by PCR-DGGE of all oiled plots demonstrated a marked rise in the proportion of species belonging to the α subgroup of the proteobacteria and also a less pronounced increase in species of the Flexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroidesphylum. By week 14, no strong bands representing gram-positive microorganisms were detectable in any oiled plot. Thus, the increase in the relative abundance of gram-negative biomass detected in oiled plots by PLFA analysis could be tentatively ascribed to the growth of a limited number of species related to these two groups. This conclusion is in close agreement with the viable MPN observations showing that both alkane and PAH degraders increased significantly within the first 2 weeks after oil was applied to the plots, compared to the unoiled plots. The disappearance of γ-subgroup proteobacterial species as a major component of the bacterial community after time zero was common to all samples and therefore not related to oiling. The only apparent differences between oiled treatments that were related to the abundance of gram-negative bacteria were between plots receiving nutrients and those that did not. An α-proteobacterium related to the genus Sphingomonas reached detection levels in at least one natural attenuation plot but was not detected in plots receiving nutrients. In all plots receiving nutrients, two closely related sequences, derived from members of theFlexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides phylum and differing by a single base pair over the region recovered, were detected. It is noteworthy that these two bands appeared only in the nutrient-amended plots and not in the natural attenuation plots. It is possible that the appearance of the source microorganism(s) of these bands was directly related to the addition of biostimulating nutrients, which may have been limiting in the natural attenuation plots, thus precluding their development. If this was the case, then this would be evidence that nutrient addition brought about a change in the microbial ecology in the treated plots that may, at least partially, have caused the significantly higher biodegradation rates in these plots. Although PLFA analysis indicated that the overall microbial community structures of all plots were becoming more similar by week 14, PCR-DGGE analysis indicated that at a finer scale, considerable differences between the bacterial communities of oiled and unoiled samples persisted.
