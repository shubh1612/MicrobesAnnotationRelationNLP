Other investigators observed no increase in biodegradation rates (87) or an increase only after a delay of several months to a year (97, 110) when fertilizer amendments were used. These seemingly contradictory results have been attributed by Bossert and Bartha (29) to the variable and complex composition of soils and to other factors such as nitrogen reserves and the presence of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The importance of pressure as a variable in the biodegradation of hydrocarbons is most probably confined to the deep-sea environment. Reports of the effects of pressure have been limited to the studies conducted by Schwarz et al. (120-122) in which the degradation of tetradecane, hexadecane, and a mixed hydrocarbon substrate by a mixed culture of deep-sea sediment bacteria was monitored at 1 atm (ca. 101 kPa) and 495 or 500 atm (ca. 50,140 or 50,650 kPa). At 4Â°C, 94% of the hexadecane was utilized only after a 40-week incubation under conditions of high pressure, compared with 8 weeks at 1 atm (122). Colwell and Walker (44) have suggested that oil which reaches the deep-ocean environment will be degraded very slowly by microbial populations and, consequently, that certain recalcitrant fractions of the oil could persist for years or decades. The water activity or water potential (a,,) of soils can range from 0.0 to 0.99, in contrast to aquatic environments, in which water activity is stable at a value near 0.98 (29). Hydrocarbon biodegradation in terrestrial ecosystems may therefore be limited by the available water for microbial growth and metabolism. Dibble and Bartha (51), in a study of oil sludge degradation in soil, reported optimal rates of biodegradation at 30 to 90% water saturation. The failure to observe inhibition of degradation at the lower values was ascribed to a hydrocarbon-mediated reduction in the waterholding capacity of the soil. In contrast to most aquatic ecosystems, soil pH can be highly variable, ranging from 2.5 in mine spoils to 11.0 in alkaline deserts (29). Most heterotrophic bacteria and fungi favor a pH near neutrality, with fungi being more tolerant of acidic conditions (8). Extremes in pH, as can be observed in some soils, would therefore be expected to have a negative influence on the ability of microbial populations to degrade hydrocarbons. Verstraete et al. (138) reported a near doubling of rates of biodegradation of gasoline in an acidic (pH 4.5) soil by adjusting the pH to 7.4. Rates dropped significantly, however, when the pH was further raised to 8.5. Similarly, Dibble and Bartha (51) observed an optimal pH of 7.8, in the range 5.0 to 7.8, for the mineralization of oily sludge in soil. The pH of sediments in special environments such as salt marshes may be as low as 5.0 in some cases (102). Hambrick et al. (66) found the rates of microbial mineralization of octadecane and napthalene to be depressed at this pH compared with pH 6.5. Octadecane mineralization rates increased further when the pH was raised from 6.5 to 8.0, whereas naphthalene mineralization rates did not. Hydrocarbons in the environment are biodegraded primarily by the bacteria and fungi. Although ubiquitous in' terrestrial (16, 79) and aquatic (33, 92, 149) ecosystems, the fraction of the total heterotrophic community represented by the hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria and fungi is highly variable, with reported frequencies ranging from 6% (80) to 82% (106) for soil fungi, 0.13% (80) to 50% (106) for soil bacteria, and 0.003% (69) to 100% (92) for marine bacteria. Individual organisms can metabolize only a limited range of hydrocarbon substrates (31), so that assemblages of mixed populations with overall broad enzymatic capacities are required to degrade complex mixtures of hydrocarbons such as crude oil in soil (29), freshwater (45), and marine (7, 54) environments. The ability to degrade and/or utilize hydrocarbon substrates is exhibited by a wide variety of bacterial and fungal genera. Floodgate (54) lists 25 genera of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria and 27 genera of hydrocarbon-degrading fungi which have been isolated from the marine environment; a similar compilation by Bossert and Bartha (29) for soil isolates includes 22 genera of bacteria and 31 genera of fungi.
