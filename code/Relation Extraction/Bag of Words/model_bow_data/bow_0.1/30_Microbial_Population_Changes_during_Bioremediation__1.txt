Three crude oil bioremediation techniques were applied in a randomized block field experiment simulating a coastal oil spill. Four treatments (no oil control, oil alone, oil plus nutrients, and oil plus nutrients plus an indigenous inoculum) were applied. In situ microbial community structures were monitored by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and 16S rDNA PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to (i) identify the bacterial community members responsible for the decontamination of the site and (ii) define an end point for the removal of the hydrocarbon substrate. The results of PLFA analysis demonstrated a community shift in all plots from primarily eukaryotic biomass to gram-negative bacterial biomass with time. PLFA profiles from the oiled plots suggested increased gram-negative biomass and adaptation to metabolic stress compared to unoiled controls. DGGE analysis of untreated control plots revealed a simple, dynamic dominant population structure throughout the experiment. This banding pattern disappeared in all oiled plots, indicating that the structure and diversity of the dominant bacterial community changed substantially. No consistent differences were detected between nutrient-amended and indigenous inoculum-treated plots, but both differed from the oil-only plots. Prominent bands were excised for sequence analysis and indicated that oil treatment encouraged the growth of gram-negative microorganisms within the α-proteobacteria andFlexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides phylum. α-Proteobacteria were never detected in unoiled controls. PLFA analysis indicated that by week 14 the microbial community structures of the oiled plots were becoming similar to those of the unoiled controls from the same time point, but DGGE analysis suggested that major differences in the bacterial communities remained. The study of microbial diversity and community dynamics is rapidly growing in microbial ecology. Interest in this area has been catalyzed by the rapid advancement of molecular ecological methodologies. Through the use of culture-independent molecular techniques, new insights into the composition of uncultivated microbial communities have been gained (see reference11 for an excellent review). It is now becoming possible to define the causes of time-dependent changes in the health of a stressed ecosystem on the basis of the structural composition of the ecosystem population (11). In particular, analysis of the microbial communities that take part in in situ hydrocarbon biodegradation activities has been a challenge to microbiologists. The reason for this is that most (∼90 to 99%) of the species making up competent degrading communities do not form colonies when current laboratory-based culture techniques are used (24, 25, 38). The measurement of lipid biomarkers, specifically, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA), together with nucleic acid-based molecular techniques for fingerprinting the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) component of microbial cells is a powerful combination of techniques for elucidating the microbial ecology of actively bioremediating communities (29). Lipid biomarker-based techniques measure the lipid profiles of microbes in the environment irrespective of culturability, thereby avoiding culture bias (36, 37). These methods provide insight into several important characteristics of microbial communities, specifically the viable biomass, community structure, and nutritional status or physiological stress responses of the gram-negative bacteria (37, 38). Microbial communities within contaminated ecosystems tend to be dominated by those organisms capable of utilizing and/or surviving toxic contamination. As a result, these communities are typically less diverse than those in nonstressed systems, although the diversity may be influenced by the complexity of chemical mixtures present and the length of time the populations have been exposed. However, when gram-negative bacteria dominate the system (as is usually the case in hydrocarbon-contaminated environments), the insight gained from lipid biomarker analysis primarily concerns nutritional or physiological status with little differentiation among bacterial species. A complementary method by which the shift in such a microbial community structure can be monitored in greater detail is denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). This method makes use of the 16S rDNA molecule carried by all bacteria, the sequences of which provide molecular markers for species identification (for historical reviews on the use of rRNA sequences for studying microbial communities, see references 1, 20, and 22). The method was originally used for profiling microbial populations in environmental samples by Muyzer et al. (19). Recent examples of its application can be found in references 6, 8, 17, 21,28, and 32. This study was undertaken to gain insight on the progress of natural attenuation and enhanced bioremediation during a controlled oil spill field experiment in Delaware (33).
