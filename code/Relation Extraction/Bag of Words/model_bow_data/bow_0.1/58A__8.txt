1993) and in continuous anaerobic biofilm reactors (Fathepure & Vogel 1991). In these experiments, tri, di- and mono-chlorinated benzenes accumulated as the end products of reductive dechlorination. When tri- and dichlorobenzenes were tested, these compounds were also biotransformed and chlorobenzene was found to be the most predominant end product (Bosma et al. 1988; Bosma et al. 1994). Tri- and dichlorobenzenes were not degraded in sediments when incubated under denitrifying conditions (Bosma et al. 1994). Chlorobenzene was not found to be metabolized under anaerobic conditions when it was tested in biodegradability assays (Battersby & Wilson 1989; Bosmaet al. 1994; Horowitzet al. 1981). In contrast, chlorotoluene appeared to be converted to toluene (Ramanand et al. 1993), indicating that at least some monochlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons are susceptible to anaerobic biodegradation. Highly chlorinated PCBs which are persistent in aerobic environments, are dechlorinated when PCBpolluted sediments are incubated anaerobically (Alder et al. 1993; Anid et al. 1991; Quensen-III et al. 1988; Van Dort & Bedard 1991). Reductive dechlorination primarily takes place in the meta- and para-positions (Alder et al. 1993; Quensen-III et al. 1988) and as a consequence there is a tendency for the accumulation of ortho substituted PCBs possessing one, two or three chlorine groups. However, there is at least one report in which ortho dechlorination was shown to occur (Van Dort & Bedard 1991). PCBs with as few as three chlorine groups can be dechlorinated in anaerobic sediments (Boyle et al. 1993). Even 4,4'- dichlorobiphenyl was reductively dechlorinated to 4- chlorobiphenyl and biphenyl when this compound was incubated anaerobically with activated sludge, soil or sediments (Mavoungou et al. 1991). However, in complex mixtures of PCBs, most mono- and dichlorinated congeners are recalcitrant to anaerobic biodegradation (Anid et al. 1991). Under sulfate reducing conditions, little PCB degradation occurs (Alder et al. 1993). While dioxins with four chloro groups were not metabolized by aerobic bacteria, there are several reports that anaerobic consortia are able to dechlorinate highly chlorinated dioxins.
