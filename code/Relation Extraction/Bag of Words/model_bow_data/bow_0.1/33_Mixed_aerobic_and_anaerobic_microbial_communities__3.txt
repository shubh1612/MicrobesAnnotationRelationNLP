Quantification was performed by integrating the peak at specific m/z for each compound. External multilevel calibrations were carried out for both alkanes and PAHs quantification ranging from 0·005 to 0·5 ng μl−1, respectively. For quality control, a 1·0 ng μl−1 diesel standard solution (ASTM C12–C60 quantitative, Supelco) and a 1·0 ng μl−1 PAH Mix Standard solution (Supelco) were analysed every 12 samples. The variation of the reproducibility of extraction and quantification of samples were determined by successive extractions and injections (n = 8) of the same sample and estimated to be ± 10%. DNA extraction and PCR Microbial community DNA was extracted directly from the groundwater as previously described (Fahy et al. 2005). The method involved the use of a guanidinium thiocyanate lysis buffer (Boom et al. 1990). PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene was performed with the following primers from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA): 27F (TCT GGT TGA TCC CGC CAG) and 1392R (ACG GGC GGT GTG TAC) (Lane 1991) for members of the Archaea, and 63F (CAG GCC TAA CAC ATG CAA GTC) and 1389R (ACG GGC GGT GTG TAC AAG) (Marchesi et al. 1998) for the Bacteria. The cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation step of 94°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. Cycling was completed by a final elongation at 72°C for 10 min. Cloning and sequencing PCR products were cloned with a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), as described in the manufacturer’s instructions using One Shot TOP10 chemically competent E. coli cells. White colonies were selected from LB agar plates containing ampicillin (50 μg ml−1) and X-Gal (20 μg ml−1). The screening of inserts from transformants was performed by direct PCR amplification from colonies using primers M13 forward (GAC GTT GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA G) and M13 reverse (CAC AGG AAA CAG CTA TGA CCA TG). Heating at 94°C for 10 min preceded standard cycling conditions (see above). Amplified inserts were grouped on the basis of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns using a combination of the two restriction endonucleases CfoI and AluI (Sigma) at 37°C for 2·5 h. Representative clones of each RFLP group were sequenced, giving between 50 and 72 sequenced clones per groundwater sample. Sequencing reactions contained 1 μl of 10 pmol μl−1 of the reverse primer 1389R (Invitrogen), 2 μl of Big Dye Terminator V2·0 Cycle Sequencing kit, 6 μl of 2·5 × sequencing buffer, 5 μl of purified PCR product, and 6 μl of water. Amplification conditions were: 25 cycles of (96°C, 15 s; 60°C, 15 s; 60°C, 4 min). After sodium acetate and ethanol precipitation, the sequencing reaction products were run on a Perkin Elmer ABI PRISM 310 capillary electrophoresis automated genetic analyser. Sequences were then processed with DNA Sequencing Analysis Software version 3.3. Phylogenetic analyses The sequences obtained in this study were compared with the European Bioinformatics Institutes database by online FastA searches (Pearson and Lipman 1988) and to the Check Chimera programme (Cole et al. 2003). The profile alignment technique of ClustalW (Thompson et al. 1994) was used to obtain preliminary alignments that were manually refined in GeneDoc Multiple Sequence Alignment Editor ver. 2.6.002 (Nicholas and Nicholas 1997) taking account of secondary structure. Phylogenetic analyses were performed with the Phylip software package (Felsenstein 2001), using the Jukes–Cantor distance and the neighbour-joining methods. Significance of the branching order was determined by bootstrap analysis with 1000 re-sampled data sets. Benzene was the main pollutant in the 12 groundwater samples from the SIReN (Table 1), as previously observed (Jones et al.
