Although low percentages of i-C5 are present, n-C5 is absent or below detection limits. Relative to vent gas, hydrate-bound methane (−42.2 to −43.5 PDB) is enriched in 13C by as much as 3.8 (Table 1). The aD of hydrate-bound methane (−115 to −193 SMOW) shows much variation ( Fig. 6), and is enriched in D relative to vent gas by as much as (an atypical) 85 (Table 1). Enrichment in 13C and D of hydrate-bound methane are best explained by bacterial oxidation effects (Sassen et al., 1998). During bacterial oxidation, 12C and 1H are preferentially used from the methane reactant pool, resulting in enrichment of 13C and D in the residual methane (Coleman et al., 1981). Free-living methanotrophs attach to surfaces; they are able to utilize methane, but are unable to utilize reduced compounds with C-C bonds (Nelson and Fisher, 1995). The a13C values of C2–C4 hydrocarbons from gas hydrates and from vent gases sampled at the Bush Hill site are nearly identical (Table 1). The lack of oxidation effects of hydrate-bound C2–C4 hydrocarbons offers strong evidence that methanotrophic activity occurs on the surfaces of the sampled gas hydrate. We also considered an alternate hypothesis. Conceivably, molecular replacement of hydrate-bound hydrocarbons by free hydrocarbon gases of sediments enclosing the gas hydrates could occur. However, in contrast to the unaltered C2–C4 hydrocarbons of gas hydrate samples, specific C2–C4 hydrocarbon gases in sediment samples display strong bacterial oxidation effects (see below). This lack of correlation excludes molecular replacement by sediment gases as a viable hypothesis. Little is known about the surfaces of natural gas hydrates. Gas hydrate crystallized rapidly during sea-floor experiments at the Bush Hill study site; nucleation and crystallization of dendrites and botryoidal masses of gas hydrate occurred within minutes (Sassen and MacDonald, 1997). Rapid crystal growth is commonly known to increase fluid and solid inclusions on growth surfaces, and to increase the frequency of interconnecting flaws and fissures (Van Hook, 1961). The exterior surface area and part of the internal surface area of rapidly grown gas hydrate crystals thus could be accessible by methanotrophic bacteria. Detailed optical petrologic study of natural gas hydrate thin sections represents a critical area of future research. Relative to vent gas, hydrate-bound CO2 (−20.0 to −27.8 PDB) is depleted in 13C by as much as 22.9 (Table 1 ; Table 2). The depletion in 13C of CO2 is consistent with bacterial oxidation of hydrate-bound methane (Sassen et al., 1998). In contrast, previously analyzed natural structure II and structure H hydrates from the Gulf of Mexico contain CO2 (a13C=+18.5 to −4.4 PDB) usually assumed to be largely of deep thermogenic origin direct from vent gas ( Brooks et al., 1984 ; Brooks et al., 1986; Sassen and MacDonald, 1994). Gas hydrate mounds at Bush Hill have persisted at the same localities for years (MacDonald et al., 1994). Long duration of exposure at the sea floor could explain increased alteration effects on gas hydrates at the Bush Hill site relative to the GC 234 site. 4.4. Hydrocarbon alteration in hydrate-mound sediments Concentrations of C1–C5 hydrocarbons of four hydrate-mound sediment samples from Bush Hill are in the 88,687 to 241,808 ppm range (Table 2). The C1–C5 molecular characteristics resemble gas hydrates; specifically, hydrate-forming hydrocarbons such as C2, C3, and i-C4 occur in higher concentrations than in vent gas (Fig. 8). The sediment gas could therefore originate, at least in part, by slow or episodic decomposition of the underlying gas hydrate. Methane comprises 57.1–90.8% of C1–C5 distributions.
