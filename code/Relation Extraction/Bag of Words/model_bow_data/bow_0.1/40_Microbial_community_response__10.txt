However, RDA based on BiologTM EcoPlates data allowed the distinction between major influences on the community structure. But we should not forget that 57.3%, of the variance in the ‘Biolog area’ data remained unexplained with our measured variables and the grouping was hence influenced by unknown factors. These factors might be related to either the whole extraction method or the data analysis. For further studies, a CLPP method that does not require extraction of microorganisms from soil would be welcome.
