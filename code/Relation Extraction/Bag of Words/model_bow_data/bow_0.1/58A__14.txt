1992). Under denitrifying conditions, toluene and xylenes are degraded faster (Evans et al. 1991; Hutchins 1993; Zeyer et al. 1986). Also the biodegradation of PAH compounds, naphthalene and acenaphthalene, has been observed in denitrifying conditions (Grbic-Galic 1990; Mihelcic & Luthy 1988a; Mihelcic & Luthy 1988b). Regardless of whether NO 3, SO]- or CO2 is the electron acceptor, ben- zene biodegradation is often not observed (Bosma et al. 1994; Edwards et al. 1992; Hutchins 1993); however there are some reports of its biodegradation in methanogenic and denitrifying consortia (Grbic-Galic 1990; Vogel & Grbic-Galic 1986). The first oxygenated metabolites of toluene biodegradation were shown to be either p-cresol (Vogel & Grbic-Galic 1986) or benzyl alcohol (Edwards et al. 1994). The incorporated oxygen was derived from H20 (Vogel & Grbic-Galic 1986). Under aerobic conditions, a third type of recalcitrance can be recognized, namely, the tendency of certain compounds susceptible to free radical reactions to undergo oxidative coupling. These coupling reactions can result in the formation of recalcitrant humic-like polymers or the irreversible covalent binding of the pollutant into soil humus (e.g. bound residue). The high MW humus polymers have a remarkable stability in the environment with residence times exceeding 500 years (Stevenson 1982). Pollutants which are susceptible to these polymerization reactions include polyhydroxylated phenols, chlorophenols, nitroaromatics and aromatic amines. Phenols with ortho substituted hydroxy groups, particularly trihydroxybenzenes, are extremely susceptible to polymerization reactions, Pyrogallol, catechol, catechin and condensed tannins are rapidly autoxidized to darkly colored polymers in mild alkaline conditions (Field & Lettinga 1989; Field & Lettinga 1991; Field et al. 1989; Field et al. 1990). Catechin and condensed tannins are also readily autoxidatively polymerized in mildly acid to neutral conditions (Das 1969; Field & Lettinga 1991). The aerobic biodegradability of these compounds was limited due to the formation of humic-like polymers which were not further metabolized (Das 1969; Field & Lettinga 1991); however, catechin was shown to be degraded when incubated anaerobically (Das 1969). The COD of pyrogallol (1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene), which is rapidly metabolized in anaerobic conditions (Field & Lettinga 1987; Horowitz et al. 1981; Kaiser & Hanselmann 1982; Schink & Pfennig 1982), was found to persist for more than 28 days in aerobic activated sludge (Pitter 1976), probably due to its rapid polymerization. Pollutants in the environment will also be exposed to phenol oxidizing enzymes, such as tyrosinases, laccases and peroxidases, of plants, fungi and actinomycetes (Sjoblad & Bollag 1981). Peroxidases have been shown to occur in soil (Bollag et al. 1987). When these enzymes are involved, a much broader range of substrates can be expected to be susceptible to oxidative coupling even under mildly acidic conditions. Chlorophenols are readily copolymerized into humus with phenol oxidizing enzymes as was demonstrated both in vitro (Bollag et al. 1977; Hatcher et al.
