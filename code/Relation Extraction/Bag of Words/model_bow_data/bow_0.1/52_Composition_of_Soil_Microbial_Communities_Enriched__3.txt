For preparation of synthetic consortia, 41 bacterial standards were grown separately in 5 ml of TY medium for 5 days at room temperature. Portions (1 ml) of selected cultures were then combined, centrifuged, washed twice with B+NP medium, and finally resuspended in 3 ml of B+NP medium. Synthetic consortia SC-5, SC-9, and SC-41 consisted of, respectively, standards 3, 11, 25, 38, and 52, standards 11, 25, 26, 37, 38, 39, 41, 47, and 52, and all standards except standards 4, 21, 22, 23, 24, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 50, and 53. To determine C5+ degradation rates, 1-ml portions of resuspended enrichments or 0.5-ml portions of resuspended synthetic consortia were injected into 158-ml serum bottles containing 60 ml of B+NP medium and 2 μl of C5+ hydrocarbon (final concentration, approximately 300 μM). Sterile controls were prepared by autoclaving preparations on three consecutive days and then injecting mercuric chloride (final concentration, 2.5 mM). The amounts of individual C5+ components were determined by culture headspace analysis by using a Hewlett-Packard HP5190 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. The column used was a 0.5 μ ID RTX-5 column (30 m by 0.2 mm; Restek, Brockville, Ontario, Canada). The flow rate of the He carrier gas was 1.23 ml/min; the flow rate of air was 400 ml/min; and the flow rate of H2 was 30 ml/min. The injector and detector temperatures were 210 and 250°C, respectively. The oven temperature program was as follows: 60°C for 3 min, followed by a 10°C/min increase to 200°C and then 200°C for 5 min. Plate counts were obtained on 0.25× Luria-Bertani agar at time zero and at the end of incubation; cell densities were measured by determining the optical densities at 600 nm at the same times with a Shimadzu UV-265 spectrophotometer. Following subculturing, standard 55 grew poorly on naphthalene but grew well on salicylate. Standards were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as members ofPseudomonas spp. (Table 1, standards 42 to 46, 49, 54, and 55), Alcaligenes spp. (Table 1, standards 47, 48, and 52),Rhodococcus sp. (Table 1, standard 50),Microbacterium sp. (Table 1, standard 51), orArthrobacter sp. (Table 1, standard 53). TheS ab values indicating the degrees of similarity of these standards to their nearest RDP homologs were high (S ab > 0.82) except for standard 53 (Sab = 0.66). The ratio of hybridization constants for each standard and bacteriophage λ DNA was determined. These data were required to calculatefx values from experimentally determined hybridization intensities (19). Like previously isolated toluene-degrading standards (Table 1, standards 36 to 41) (4), many of the new isolates grew optimally at a preferred hydrocarbon concentration. When liquid MSM cultures of Pseudomonas spp. strains S1, S2, and S3 (Table1, standards 42 to 44), which originally were isolated on styrene, were grown in desiccators equilibrated with 0, 1, 10, 50, or 100% (wt/wt) styrene in vpo, S1 grew optimally in the presence of 10% styrene and S2 grew optimally in the presence of 50% styrene. S3 grew equally well in atmospheres equilibrated with 10 and 50% styrene, although it grew considerably more slowly than S1 and S2 (Fig.1). All aerobically growing standards (except standards 22 to 24 and 27 to 29) were tested for growth on MSM plates with individual C5+ hydrocarbons as the sole carbon and energy sources. The plates were incubated in desiccators equilibrated with a C5+ hydrocarbon at a concentration of either 1 or 10% (wt/wt) in vpo. The results are summarized in Table 1. Of the 44 standards tested, 36 were capable of degrading one or more C5+ compounds.
