1). Hydrocarbon data measured along this main axis and along three secondary axes (90°, 180° and 270° to the main axis) showed that vapor migration was generally isotropic. The soil temperature was measured with fixed installed thermometers to a depth of 2.5 m. At sampling distances of 0.7 (samples A, D and G), 2 (B, E and H) and 10 m (C, F and I) from the source center (for the spatial arrangement of coring sites see Fig. 1), three soil cores were sampled on three different days. Soil cores A–C were taken on the 24th day before contamination, soil cores D–F and cores G–I on the 23rd and 80th day after contamination of the site, respectively. The soil cores D, E, G and H were taken within the vapor plume. Microbial populations in these cores had been more or less steadily exposed to hydrocarbon vapors for about 20 days (cores D + E) and 77 days (cores G + H). At 10 m from the source, most hydrocarbons were at all times below the detection limits, except n-hexane, isooctane, cyclopentane, methylcyclopentane, methylcyclohexane and 3-methylpentane which were detected in traces between day 13 and 17. Therefore, the microbial populations in samples from the soil cores F and I can be viewed as uninfluenced by petroleum hydrocarbons, in addition to those of soil cores A–C taken prior to contamination. A maximum petroleum vapor mass in the soil pore air of 450 g was reached after 17 days and then decreased to 2 g on day 350. The vapor concentrations of individual components generally decreased three orders of magnitude within 2–8 m lateral distance from the buried source. Only after 113 days did the most volatile compounds (cyclopentane, 3-methylpentane and methylcyclopentane) disappear completely from the vadose zone at 2 m distance from the source center and some compounds persisted at the site for more than one year. In order to avoid any disturbance of the soil by the installed gas or water sampling devices, soil samples were taken only at locations outside the buried petroleum and along an axis at an angle of 120–140° to the main sampling axis. Soil cores were taken using a stainless steel hollow-stem soil corer of 2.8 cm diameter (LB system, Geoprobe, Salina, Kansas). The corer was driven into the ground by a motor hammer until the moraine gravel made further lowering impossible. Undisturbed samples were obtained in PVC liners of 60 cm length. The top 10–15 cm in each liner were discarded to exclude topsoil, which had fallen into the hole. Soil samples were transferred on site into sterile PE tubes and stored at soil temperature (15 ± 3 °C) for a maximum of 3 days before they were homogenized, sieved (<2 mm) and further analyzed. After coring, each remaining hole was filled with clean sand and bentonite. Soil gas for the measurement of oxygen and carbon dioxide was sampled at 107 gas sampling tubes represented as black circles in Fig. 1. These probes were purged of dead air before samples of 3 ml were withdrawn with a syringe. The gas samples were stored in evacuated blood collection tubes (Venoject tubes, Terumo, Leuven, Belgium) and analyzed using a portable Chrompack Micro GC (Middelburg, The Netherlands). The method has been previously described in [30]. Since the sampling days for CO2 and O2 did not correspond to the sampling days of the soil cores, adjustment was allowed for gas data by linearly interpolating between consecutive dates. Linear interpolation was considered accurate enough since the delay between gas sampling days and the core drilling never exceeded more than 3% of the total duration of the experiment. For the depths of the samples A10, A11, A12, D10 and G10, no CO2 values were available. Average values of the corresponding samples were used for statistical analysis instead. Contour plots were drawn with Surfer 7.00 (Golden Software Inc., Colorado, USA) using Kriging for interpolation.
