Analogous to the steps involved in the anaerobic hydroxylation of ethylbenzene, hydroxylation of the alkane at C2 would produce a secondary alcohol that could be further oxidized to a ketone, similar to the formation of acetophenone during ethylbenzene degradation (Figure 2C; Ball et al., 1996; Rabus and Heider, 1998) Subsequent transformation of the ketone may involve carboxylation at C3, with elimination of the C1 and C2 carbons, to produce a fatty acid that is one carbon shorter than the parent alkane. The latter would be consistent with previous studies (So and Young, 1999; Callaghan et al., 2006, 2009). Proteomic investigations of alkane-degrading cells of Hxd3 implicate the putative ethylbenzene dehydrogenase (Sünwoldt et al., 2012). However, further study is needed to elucidate the transformation reactions that would ultimately result in the formation of the observed fatty acids. Conclusion The anaerobic oxidation of alkanes plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of methane and the bioremediation of hydrocarbon-impacted environments. As we look to the future, advances in next-generation sequencing and annotation will facilitate genome-enabled transcriptomic and proteomic investigations of anaerobic alkane oxidation. The complete genome sequences of several model alkane utilizers are now publicly available and include: Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans AK-01, Desulfococcus oleovorans Hxd3, ‘Candidatus Methylomirabilis. oxyfera,’ and the Gammaproteobacterium, strain HdN1. Future work will rely on these model organisms for the purification and characterization of relevant enzymes.
