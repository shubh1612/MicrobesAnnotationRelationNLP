For [13C]toluene incubations, the initial toluene concentration in the microcosms was 35 μg of [13C]toluene ml−1. The microcosms were destructively sampled at 0, 95.5, and 119 h after toluene addition. All treatments were performed in triplicate, and [13C]toluene-amended samples were compared with sterile (gamma-irradiated) and toluene-free controls. For [13C]glucose incubations, 4,000 μg of [13C]glucose g−1 was added to 25 g (dry weight) of soil in enough water to bring gravimetric moisture levels to 25%. Samples were incubated at 25°C for 40 h prior to destructive sampling. PLFA analyses.PLFA analyses were performed as previously described (3). Briefly, soil lipids and microbial cultures were extracted with a one-phase chloroform-methanol-water extractant, fractionated according to polarity by column chromatography on silica gel columns, and derivatized by mild alkaline methanolysis to form polar lipid-derived fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). The FAME were separated on a Hewlett-Packard (HP) 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 25-meter HP Ultra 2 capillary column (internal diameter, 0.20 mm; film thickness, 0.33 μm) with H2 carrier gas and a programmed temperature increase from 170 to 260°C at 2°C/min. GC-mass spectrometry (MS) analyses were performed with a Varian Star 3400CX gas chromatograph (30-meter J&W DB-5 capillary column; internal diameter, 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 μm) coupled to a Varian Saturn 4D ion trap MS. Chromatographic peaks were quantified based on a 19:0 internal standard by GC with flame ionization detection. Double-bond locations in monounsaturated PLFA were confirmed by GC-MS of their dimethyldisulfide adducts (7). Identification of PLFA is based on comparison of retention times with authentic standards and on mass spectral analysis. Polar lipid-derived FAME were also analyzed by capillary GC-combustion-isotope ratio MS (GC-C-IRMS). Carbon isotopic compositions of individual polar lipid FAME in each soil extract were determined with an HP 6890 gas chromatograph (HP-5 capillary column; 30 m; internal diameter, 0.32 mm; film thickness, 0.25 μm) connected via a Europa ORCHID on-line combustion interface to a Europa Geo 20/20 MS operating in continuous-flow mode. The carrier gas was He, and the oven temperature program was 20°C/min from 45 to 140°C, 1.5°C/min to 210°C, and 20°C/min to 250°C. The atom percent 13C (moles of 13C/moles of12C × 100) values for individual FAME peaks were calculated with respect to a standard CO2 reference gas injected at the beginnings and ends of analytical runs. The values reported are averages of three replicate microcosm PLFA extracts. The natural abundance of 13C is 1.11% (15). The following fatty acid nomenclature is used: a total number of carbon atoms:number of double bonds, followed by the position of the double bond from the methyl (ω) end of the molecule (e.g., 17:1ω8).cis and trans geometry is indicated by the suffixes c and t. The prefixes a and i refer to anteiso- and isobranching, 10me indicates a methyl group on the 10th carbon atom from the carboxyl end of the molecule, the positions of hydroxy (OH) groups are noted, and cy indicates cyclopropane fatty acids. Bacterial isolation and identification.Toluene-degrading bacterial cultures were isolated from Yolo silt loam by enrichment on toluene. One gram (dry weight) of soil was added to 99 ml of mineral salts medium (MSM) (22) supplemented with 200 μg of toluene ml−1 as the sole carbon source. The culture was incubated at 25°C in the dark with shaking. After the culture became turbid (approximately 5 days), 1 ml was transferred to a second 99 ml of MSM containing 200 μg of toluene ml−1. This was repeated for a total of four transfers. The final liquid culture was streaked onto 0.1× tryptic soy agar (TSA) and incubated at 25°C. Individual colonies were tested in liquid culture for the ability to utilize toluene as a sole carbon source. Subsequent culturing of toluene-degrading strains was accomplished in toluene-amended MSM under the conditions described above. Toluene-degrading bacterial strains were initially identified by whole-cell FAME analysis with the MIDI system (24). One strain, designated YT-2, was further characterized by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing performed at the University of California, Davis, Automated Sequencing Facility with the eubacterial primers 357F and 1406R (18). Both strands of the 16S gene were sequenced.
