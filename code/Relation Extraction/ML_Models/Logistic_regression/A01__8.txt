Benzoate was also detected in GoM278 and GoM315 sediments, suggesting further transformation of the benzylsuccinate derivatives of monoaromatic hydrocarbons (Beller and Spormann, 1997; Leuthner et al., 1998). However, benzoate can be formed during the metabolism of a wide variety of aromatic compounds under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Overall, this study took an interdisciplinary approach of investigating the phylogenetic composition and functional potential of Gulf of Mexico deep-sea sediment communities following the DWH oil spill. Based on metagenomic analyses, functional gene clone libraries, and metabolite profiling, the data herein suggest that the presence of PAHs, alkanes, and alkenes may influence the microbial community through the enrichment of Deltaproteobacteria capable of anaerobic hydrocarbon metabolism. This evidence suggests that the microbial communities exposed to anthropogenic hydrocarbon loading in the Gulf of Mexico deep-sea sediments likely impacted the bioremediation of the DWH oil spill through anaerobic degradation, which has been previously overlooked. The integrated approach used herein augments other efforts to deduce the fate of the oil spilled in the DWH incident and to assess the impact of the spill on the indigenous microbial communities.
