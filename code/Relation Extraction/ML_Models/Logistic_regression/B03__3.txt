The highest positive dilutions were enriched for Fe(III) reducers capable of degrading benzene by the re-addition of benzene and continued monitoring of benzene removal. Active enrichments were transferred to fresh Fe(III)-reducing media prior to phylogenetic analyses. 16S rDNA phylogenetic analysis of enrichment cultures.The phylogeny of the dominant organisms in benzene-oxidizing enrichment cultures was investigated by using 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence analysis. Prior to DNA extraction, cultures were treated with oxalic acid in order to chelate and remove Fe(III), which inhibitsTaq polymerase (48). Then, 15 ml of 300 mM filter-sterilized oxalic acid was added to 5 ml of enrichment culture and mixed thoroughly. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min, washed in 1 ml of 30 mM NaHCO3, and resuspended in 250 μl of 30 mM NaHCO3. The resulting cell suspensions were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles at −70 and 65°C and then extracted with phenol, phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1) (39). A 5-μl portion of the resulting aqueous phase was used as a template for PCR with primers 338F-GC (the complement of EUB338) (1) and 907R (21). Genomic DNA was also extracted from pure cultures ofGeobacter chapellei, Geobacter sulfurreducens,Escherichia coli, Desulfococcus multivorans, andDesulfuromusa acetexigens (6) for use as reference DNA in PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). PCR mixtures containing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM each deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP), 0.6 μM each primer, and 400 ng of bovine serum albumin (BSA) per μl in a total volume of 100 μl were assembled and treated with UV for 10 min. A total of 2.5 U of AmpliTaq Taqpolymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, Conn.) and template DNA were then added to each reaction. Amplification was performed in a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus) with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 90 s; 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 40°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s; and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis by standard techniques (39). The 16S rDNA amplicons were resolved by DGGE with a 50 to 80% denaturant gradient (where 100% is equivalent to 7 M urea and 40% formamide) (35) on a 7% acrylamide gel in 1× TAE (40 mM Tris-acetate [pH 7.4], 20 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA). DGGE gels were run for 16 h at 65 V and then were stained with ethidium bromide (39). Resolved PCR products were visualized by UV transillumination. Isolated bands were excised and pulverized with a sterile mortar and pestle, and DNA was eluted overnight in 50 μl of 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.0) at 4°C. Partial 16S rDNAs were then reamplified from excised bands, as described above, and analyzed by a second DGGE in order to ensure that heteroduplexes were resolved. Once again, isolated bands were excised, and 16S rDNA was reamplified as described above, except that no GC clamp (35) was incorporated into primer 338F. These PCR products were purified by using Wizard PCR Preps (Promega, Madison, Wis.) and sequenced by using Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing (Perkin-Elmer Cetus) and an ABI 373A automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) at the Michigan State University Sequencing Facility or the University of Massachusetts Department of Microbiology. Phylogenetic diversity of sediment microbial communities.Detailed phylogenetic analyses were focused on the uncontaminated site and the site where Anderson et al. (4) demonstrated that benzene oxidation occurred under in situ Fe(III)-reducing conditions (site IR-3). The 16S rDNA phylogeny of dominant members of the sediment microbial community was analyzed by using PCR-DGGE and sequence analysis. DNA was extracted from triplicate 500-mg samples of homogenized sediment by using the FastDNA soil extraction kit (Bio 101, Vista, Calif.) as described by the manufacturer, except that cell lysis was carried out with a Mini-BeadBeater (Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, Okla.) at maximum speed for 1 min. DNA was eluted from Bio 101 cartridges with 50 μl of sterile Milli-Q water. For analysis of the diversity of Geobacteraceae, partial 16S rDNA was amplified from triplicate sediment DNA extractions with primers 338F-GC and Geo825R. PCR conditions were as described above for primers 338F and 907R except that PCR mixtures were not treated with UV and the PCR temperature profile included touchdown primer annealing (12) from 65 to 55°C (decreasing 0.5°C per cycle) for 20 cycles, followed by 10 cycles at 55°C. Geobacteraceae 16S rDNA amplicons were analyzed by DGGE on a 55 to 70% denaturant gradient, and individual bands were excised, checked for heteroduplexes, reamplified, and sequenced as described above. For analysis of the dominant members of the bacterial community, partial 16S rDNAs were amplified from triplicate sediment DNA samples by using primers 338F-GC and 907R as described above.
