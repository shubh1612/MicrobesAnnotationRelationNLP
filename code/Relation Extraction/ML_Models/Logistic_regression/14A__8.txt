The only trend consistently observed between the culture-dependent and -independent approaches, with respect to the level of microbial diversity, was that of a geographical separation between the Alert and Kuujjuaq samples. CLPP results were not able to differentiate samples based on level of contamination. In the Alert soils, hydrocarbon contamination increased the apparent microbial diversity, while in Kuujjuaq soils, the bacterial diversity was decreased. 16S rDNA sequencing of selected DGGE bands identified high G+C Gram-positive organisms belonging to the Actinomycetales as the predominant microorganisms, which are known to be important in the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons.
