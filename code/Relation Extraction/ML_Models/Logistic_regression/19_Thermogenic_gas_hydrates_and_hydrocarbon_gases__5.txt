The a13C of methane (−44.1 and −46.0 PDB) varies by 1.9, and aD shows little variation (−198 and −200 SMOW). The isotopic properties of methane and associated C2–C4 hydrocarbons indicate a thermogenic origin (Sassen and MacDonald, 1997). The a13C of CO2 from the vent gas samples shows little variation (−4.9 and −5.4 PDB; Table 1). Thermogenic vent gas from GC 234 is similar in composition to the vent gas from Bush Hill (compare Fig. 6 ; Fig. 7). One sample of GC 234 vent gas has methane (93.7% of the C1–C5 distribution) with a a13C of −48.7 PDB and a aD of −203 SMOW ( Table 1). The molecular distributions and a13C values of the C2–C5 hydrocarbons are also similar to vent gas from Bush Hill (Table 1). The a13C of vent gas CO2 is +2.9 PDB (Table 1). Compositional similarities suggest vent gases at both sites are derived from the same Mesozoic subsurface hydrocarbon system. In contrast, vent gas from the brine pool in GC 233 is largely bacterial methane (MacDonald et al., 1990b). Two vent gas samples show high percentages of methane (97.8% and 97.4%); thermogenic C2 and C3 are minor components, and the C4 and C5 hydrocarbons are absent or below detection limits (Table 1). The a13C values of methane are −64.3 and −65.5 PDB, and the aD values are −200 and −165 SMOW; the latter gas contains CO2 with a a13C of −25.3 PDB (Table 1). The isotopic properties of the vent methane are consistent with an origin from reduction of CO2 via bacterial methanogenesis ( Jenden and Kaplan, 1986 ; Coleman et al., 1996). Structure II gas hydrate near the orifices of gas vents at the GC 234 site is assumed to have crystallized from the associated vent gas. The change in phase from vent gas to solid structure II gas hydrate involves molecular fractionation favoring gases of appropriate molecular diameter (Sloan, 1990). Methane decreases in abundance relative to vent gas, and C2–C4 hydrate-forming gases increase in abundance in structure II gas hydrate (Sloan, 1990). The molecular fractionation during gas hydrate crystallization from vent gas at GC 234 is illustrated in Fig. 7. Relative to vent gas, methane of gas hydrate occurs in lower percentage (73.8%), and the C2, C3, i-C4, and n-C4 hydrocarbons are present in higher percentages (Table 1). Meaningful carbon isotopic fractionation is not thought to occur during gas hydrate crystallization (Claypool et al., 1985; Brooks et al., 1986; Kennicutt et al., 1988 ; Sassen and MacDonald, 1997). The a13C (−48.4 PDB) and aD (−203 SMOW) of hydrate-bound methane are nearly identical to vent gas, as are the a13C values of the hydrate-bound C2–C4 hydrocarbons (Table 1; Fig. 7). Measurable isotopic fractionation of carbon or hydrogen is not observed at this site, perhaps because the gas hydrate was only exposed at the sea floor recently. The GC 234 gas hydrate serves as a benchmark in terms of isotopic properties, allowing comparison to other gas hydrates with a longer duration of exposure at the sea floor. 4.3. Gas hydrate alteration The C1–C5 molecular distributions of hydrocarbons from five samples of structure II gas hydrate from Bush Hill are illustrated in Fig. 6. Methane occurs in lower percentages (71.7–85.7%) than in associated vent gas; the C2, C3, i-C4, and n-C4 hydrocarbons are present in higher percentages (Table 1).
