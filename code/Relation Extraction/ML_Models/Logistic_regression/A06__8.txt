Thus, using several different primer sets, which can be designed from new conserved regions, and combining information from the model approach, should help to better understand the biology behind gene diversity. This information should also provide the probes or other tools that can aid the recovery of full-length gene sequences from the environment for functional studies. Moreover, testing the expression and activity of those genes toward aromatic hydrocarbons will be important for suggesting their function in nature.
