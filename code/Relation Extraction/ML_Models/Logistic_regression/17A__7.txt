The treatment 2M bands with the highest PC2 loading values were B2-3 and B2-16, while for the 4M treatment B4-17 had the most negative PC2 loading value. Band B4-3, which was the most abundant band in the early biodegradation stage at 0 to 45 days for the 4M treatment, disappeared after 90 days and did not have a high PCA loading value (Table 4). Nevertheless, this band could be important in the biodegradation of three-ring PAHs because at this time these compounds exhibited maximum depletion. Phylogenetic and dynamic analysis of excised bands.Taxonomic assignments of the prominent DGGE bands were determined for biostimulation treatments 2M and 4M. Bands from untreated soil (treatment 1M) were not excised because they were weak, but they were assigned to comigrating bands of treatments 2M and 4M which exhibited higher intensity (Fig. 2 and Table 4). Table 4 shows the closest relatives of DGGE bands excised for biostimulation treatments 2M and 4M. Most of the sequences derived from DGGE bands exhibited levels of similarity greater than 95%. Taking into account the assignment to comigrating bands, the original soil contained five α-Proteobacteria (Sphingomonas, Rhizobium-Agrobacterium, and Azospirillum groups) and eight γ-Proteobacteria (Xanthomonas group), according to RDP classification (24). Biostimulated soil from treatment 2M contained 53% α-Proteobacteria (9/17 DGGE bands), 6% β-Proteobacteria (1/17 DGGE bands), and 23% γ-Proteobacteria (4/17 DGGE bands) (Table 4). No rhodococci were found, but the closest relatives to the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) group, which accounted for 12% of the sample (2/17 DGGE bands), were found after 45 days. Soil subjected to the 4M treatment contained 55% α-Proteobacteria (11/20 DGGE bands), 15% β-Proteobacteria (3/20 DGGE bands), 25% γ-Proteobacteria (5/20 DGGE bands), and 5% high-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria (1/20 DGGE bands). No close relatives belonging to the CFB group were found in the 4M treatment soil. At early stages (0 to 90 days), for treatment 2M soil five dominant bands (relative intensity greater than 5%) were observed (B2-11, B2-12, B2-20, B2-8, and B2-9) (Table 4). Three of these bands (B2-11, B2-12, and B2-20) belonged to α-Proteobacteria (Sphingomonadaceae and Rhodospirillaceae), whereas B2-8 belonged to β-Proteobacteria (Comamonadaceae) and B2-9 belonged to γ-Proteobacteria (Xanthomonadaceae). Neither CFB bacteria nor high-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria were found at early stages of biodegradation. At late stages (90 to 200 days), for treatment 2M soil five dominant bands (relative intensity greater than 5%) were observed (B2-1, B2-3, B2-15, B2-16, and B2-19) (Table 4). Three of these bands (B2-15, B2-16, and B2-19) belonged to the γ-Proteobacteria (Comamonadaceae and Xanthomonadaceae). B2-1 belonged to the α-Proteobacteria (Sphingomonadaceae), and B2-3 belonged to the CFB group (Crenotrichaceae). Neither β-Proteobacteria nor high-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria were found. At early stages (0 to 90 days), for treatment 4M soil nine dominant bands (relative intensity greater than 5%) were observed (B4-3, B4-6, B4-8, B4-10, B4-11, B4-12, B4-13, B4-20, and B4-24) (Table 4). Six of these bands (B4-3, B4-6, B4-11, B4-12, B4-13, and B4-24) belonged to α-Proteobacteria (Sphingomonadaceae, Rhizobiaceae, and Rhodospirillaceae), one band (B4-20) belonged to β-Proteobacteria (Alcaligenaceae), and two bands (B4-8 and B4-10) belonged to γ-Proteobacteria (Xanthomonadaceae). Neither CFB bacteria nor high-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria were found. At late stages (90 to 200 days), for treatment 4M soil nine dominant bands (relative intensity greater than 5%) were observed (B4-7, B4-10, B4-14, B4-17, B4-20, B4-21, B4-23, and B4-28). Four of these bands (B4-10, B4-14, B4-17, and B4-21) belonged to γ-Proteobacteria (Xanthomonadaceae and unclassified group), two bands (B4-20 and B4-7) belonged to β-Proteobacteria (Alcaligenaceae), and one band (B4-23) belonged to α-Proteobacteria (Rhizobiaceae), whereas band B4-28 belonged to the high-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria (Nocardiaceae). No CFB bacteria were found. Phylogenetic groups during bioremediation.At the beginning of the experiment, α-Proteobacteria (78%), dominated by Sphingomonadaceae, were predominant in contaminated soil, followed by γ-Proteobacteria (16%), dominated by Xanthomonadaceae, whereas the other groups were scarce. During biodegradation, the microbial population shifted dramatically, and after 200 days of incubation of the 2M treatment, γ-Proteobacteria were dominant (50%), followed by α-Proteobacteria (25%) and the CFB group (22%), while for the 4M treatment, α-Proteobacteria and γ-Proteobacteria were the dominant groups (36% each), followed by β-Proteobacteria and high-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria (19% and 8%, respectively) (Fig. 4).
