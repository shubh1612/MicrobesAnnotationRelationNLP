(2001) directly from the sand and lava granules. Agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry were used for quality check and quantification. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments were PCR-amplified and cloned as described elsewhere (Kleinsteuber et al., 2006) using the universal primers 27F and 1492R (Lane, 1991). Clone libraries were screened by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) with HaeIII and hierarchical cluster analysis of the ARDRA patterns as described by Kleinsteuber et al. (2006). Partial DNA sequencing of representative clones was performed using the BigDye RR Terminator AmpliTaq FS Kit 1.1 (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) and the sequencing primers 27F and 519R (Lane, 1991). For almost complete sequencing of selected clones, sequencing primers 27F, 357F, 530F, 926F, 1114F, 519R, 1100R and 1492R (Lane, 1991) were used. Capillary electrophoresis and data collection were carried out on an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed using abi prism dna sequencing analysis software, and 16S rRNA gene sequences were assembled by abi prism autoassembler software. The blastn tool (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) (Altschul et al., 1990) was used to search for similar sequences in the GenBank database, and the Seqmatch tool was used to search for similar sequences compiled by the Ribosomal Database Project – II Release 9.4 (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu) (Cole et al., 2005). The phylogenetic analysis was accomplished with arb software, version Linux Beta 030822 (http://arb-home.de) (Ludwig et al., 2004). The determined sequences were initially aligned to the SILVA SSURef database Release 90 (http://www.arb-silva.de) (Pruesse et al., 2007) by the arb Positional Tree Server and added to the SILVA tree using the Quick Add Parsimony tool and applying a Bacteria-specific filter. The alignment was verified by comparison with the next relative sequences and corrected manually. The final position within the arb tree and bootstrap values were calculated by the Parsimony Interactive tool. The determined 16S rRNA gene sequences were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers EF613368–EF613487. T-RFLP analyses Bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments were PCR-amplified with the primers 27F-FAM (labeled at the 5′ end with phosphoramidite fluorochrome-5-carboxyfluorescein) and 1492R (Lane, 1991). Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany) or from biomers.net (Ulm, Germany). PCR was performed in 25 μL samples containing 3 μL of 1 : 100 diluted template DNA (equivalent to 1–2.5 ng), 5 pmol of each primer and 12.5 μL Taq Master Mix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). PCR cycle conditions were as decribed previously (Kleinsteuber et al., 2006). PCR products were purified using the Wizard® SV PCR Clean-Up System (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and quantified after agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining using the genetools program (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Purified PCR products were digested with the restriction endonucleases AluI, BstUI, HaeIII or RsaI, respectively (New England Biolabs, Schwalbach, Germany). A 10 μL reaction contained 2.5 ng DNA (for T-RFLP analyses of single clones) or 20 ng DNA (for T-RFLP analyses of the whole consortium) and 10 U of restriction enzyme. Samples were incubated at the appropriate temperature for 3 h and then precipitated with sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and ethanol. Dried DNA samples were resuspended in 20 μL HiDi formamide containing 1.5% (v/v) GeneScan-500 ROX standard (Applied Biosystems). Samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and chilled on ice. The fragments were separated by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The lengths of the fluorescent terminal restriction fragments (T-RF) were determined using the genemapper V3.7 software (Applied Biosystems), and their relative peak areas were determined by dividing the individual T-RF area by the total area of peaks within the threshold of 50–500 bp. Only peaks with relative fluorescence intensities of at least 50 U were included in the analysis. Theoretical T-RF values of the dominant phylotypes represented in the clone library were calculated based on the determined partial 16S rRNA gene sequences using the NEBcutter V2.0 (http://tools.neb.com/NEBcutter2/index.php), and the calculated T-RF values were verified experimentally using the corresponding clones as templates.
