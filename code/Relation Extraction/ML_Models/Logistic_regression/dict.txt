Effect
of
ethanol
on
the
biodegradation
of
gasoline
in
an
unsaturated
tropical
soil
Abstract
Leaking
underground
storage
tanks
are
a
worldwide
problem
nowadays
therefore
gasoline
degradation
and
distribution
in
the
subsurface
have
been
widely
studied
Brazil
is
the
only
country
to
currently
use
ethanol
as
fuel
and
as
an
oxygenate
additive
to
gasoline
in
amounts
varying
from
20
to
26
v/v
Consequently
both
gasoline
and
ethanol
may
contaminate
the
environment
when
spills
and
leaks
occur
Some
authors
suggest
that
despite
the
high
degradability
of
gasoline
its
degradation
in
the
aquifer
is
hindered
by
the
preferential
biodegradation
of
ethanol
which
would
delay
gasoline
degradation
however
processes
in
the
unsaturated
zone
are
far
less
understood
The
present
study
concentrates
on
degradation
and
distribution
processes
of
ethanol-amended
gasoline
in
tropical
soil
under
unsaturated
conditions
A
multi-parametrical
approach
was
adopted
to
assess
the
effects
of
ethanol
on
the
fate
of
gasoline
Undisturbed
natural
soil
was
used
to
evaluate
biodegradation
processes
while
tank
experiments
determined
differences
in
infiltration
distribution
and
retention
of
gasoline
in
unsaturated
artificial
porous
medium
Physical
chemical
and
microbiological
results
suggest
that
ethanol
enhances
BTEX
retention
in
soil
boosts
microbial
activity
but
delays
BTEX
biodegradation
The
demand
for
alternative
fuels
and
gasoline
oxygenated
additives
has
been
increasing
worldwide
driven
mostly
by
the
need
to
address
growing
problems
linked
to
the
availability
and
cost
of
fossil
fuels
and
atmospheric
pollution
Following
the
petroleum
crisis
in
the
1970s
Brazil
implemented
a
programme
for
the
replacing
of
fossil
fuel
by
renewable
ethanol
extracted
from
sugar-cane

The
advantages
and
drawbacks
of
using
ethanol
as
fuel
and
gasoline
oxygenate
have
been
largely
investigated
in
several
different
aspects
These
studies
have
been
further
stimulated
by
the
implementation
in
1990
in
the
USA
of
the
Clean
Air
Act
which
requires
the
phasing
out
of
MTBE
as
a
fuel
oxygenate
by
2005
and
its
replacement
by
ethanol

because
of
MTBE
's
poor
degradability
and
the
foul
taste
and
odour
it
gives
to

Areas
of
recent
interest
are
among
others
the
fate
and
distribution
of
ethanol
and
ethanol-blended
gasoline
in
the
environment
their
degradability
in
different
environmental
compartments
and
conditions
as
well
as
the
effects
the
presence
of
ethanol
could
have
on
the
movement
and
degradation
of
gasoline
compounds

are
undeniable

however
issues
have
come
up
concerning
ground
water
contamination
and
the
biodegradability
of
ethanol-amended
gasoline
in
the
environment
Ethanol
's
properties
affect
the
infiltration
distribution
retention
and
final
biodegradation
of
gasoline
compounds
e.g
Adam
et
al.
2002

and
Powers

Reckhorn
et
al.

Because
of
its
hydrophilicity
ethanol
partitions
almost
immediately
and
completely
into
the
aqueous
phase
thus
increasing
the
solubility
of
gasoline
in
water
the
phenomenon
of
co-solvency
also
reducing
interfaces
and
surface
tensions
Therefore
these
processes
alter
the
overall
interactions
and
equilibrium
between
water
gasoline
and
soil
particles
Laboratory
experiments
with
inert
soil
have
shown
that
as
ethanol-amended
gasoline
infiltrates
into
the
vadose
zone
ethanol
is
retained
in
soil
residual
water
while
benzene
toluene
ethyl-benzene
and
xylenes
BTEX
the
most
problematic
and
persistent
of
gasoline
compounds
progress
and
attain
the
saturated
zone
creating
an
LNAPL
pool
in
the
capillary
fringe
as
ethanol-laden
water
eventually
slowly
drains
into
the
capillary
fringe
the
scenario
is
similar
to
that
of
an
ethanol
spill
over
an
LNAPL
plume
McDowell
and
Powers
2003
Plumes
of
ethanol-amended
gasoline
have
been
compared
to
standard
gasoline
plumes
and
found
to
be
longer
for
benzene

and

this
could
be
due
to
a
delayed
degradation
of
BTEX
induced
by
the
presence
of
ethanol
the
preferential
degradation
of
which
would
deplete
soil
of
the
necessary
electron
acceptors
for
BTEX
degradation
Corseuil
et
al.
1998
da
Silva
and
Alvarez
2002
However
most
studies
address
the
saturated
zone
where
oxygen
may
be
available
only
in
restricted
amounts
for
an
effective
aerobic
degradation
of
BTEX
and
where
water
is
present
in
important
amounts
Also
experimental
approaches
often
use
inert
or
sandy
soils
leaving
relevant
doubts
about
the
effect
of
soil
components
and
microbiota
on
the
fate
of
gasoline
and
gasoline–ethanol
mixtures
Processes
involved
in
BTEX
degradation
in
the
vadose
zone
are
still
poorly
understood
especially
so
where
ethanol
effects
on
BTEX
degradation
are
concerned
The
objectives
of
these
studies
were
to
elucidate
some
of
those
processes
occurring
during
gasoline–ethanol
leaks
in
the
vadose
zone
of
a
tropical
soil
focusing
on
the
effects
of
ethanol
on
the
biodegradation
of
gasoline
compounds
as
well
as
the
importance
of
soil
components
on
the
fate
of
contaminants
Previous
studies
were
conducted
with
inert
and
sandy
soils
McDowell
and
Powers
2003
Dakhel
et
al.
2003
and
have
not
addressed
the
effects
the
presence
of
ethanol
may
have
on
the
biodegradation
of
gasoline
compounds
in
the
unsaturated
zone
Other
studies
have
evaluated
the
fate
of
blended
gasoline
in
the
saturated
zone
Corseuil
et
al.
1998
showing
a
delay
in
gasoline
degradation
because
of
the
presence
of
ethanol
Furthermore
the
influence
of
soil
constituents
on
the
fate
of
ethanol-blended
gasoline
are
also
unknown
as
most
available
data
do
not
concern
mechanisms
occurring
in
natural
soil
where
the
role
of
organic
matter
and
microbial
populations
for
instance
are
of
crucial
importance
Our
studies
focus
on
a
residual
soil
of
the
metropolitan
area
of
Rio
de
Janeiro
Almost
no
data
are
available
on
biodegradation
of
blended
gasoline
in
tropical
soils
although
leaks
frequently
occur
in
these
soils
Residual
soils
are
ubiquitous
in
Brazil
and
present
specific
geotechnical
geological
and
microbiological
characteristics
very
different
from
the
sedimentary
soils
usually
found
in
the
northern
hemisphere
characteristics
which
may
be
of
great
importance
when
biodegrading
activities
are
concerned
Monitoring
of
microbial
numbers
may
be
an
effective
tool
to
evaluate
biodegradation
processes
however
as
most
environmental
microorganisms
are
not
able
to
grow
under
laboratory
conditions
unculturable
strains
monitoring
microbial
biomass
does
not
inform
on
the
effectiveness
of
biodegrading
activities
as
population
shifts
may
happen
independently
of
microbial
activity
Thus
monitoring
microbial
degrading
activity
is
an
important
complement
to
biological
studies
on
biodegradation
of
xenobiotic
compounds

Microbial
parameters
also
allow
us
to
evaluate
whether
microbial
communities
are
being
impacted
by
contamination
and
adapting
so
as
to
eventually
start
biodegradation

The
objective
of
this
study
was
to
assess
the
effect
of
ethanol
on
the
distribution
retention
and
biodegradation
of
gasoline
compounds
in
unsaturated
tropical
soil
Laboratory
studies
were
conducted
with

undisturbed
soil
in
microcosms
Although
data
obtained
with
this
kind
of
approach
are
not
applicable
to
the
field
results
from
microcosm
studies
are
indicative
of
processes
that
may
happen
in
the
field
as
well
as
valuable
tools
to
compare

2.1.1
Soil
The
soil
used
for
this
study
is
found
in
the
metropolitan
area
of
Rio
de
Janeiro
south-eastern
Brazil
It
is
a
natural
unsaturated
soil
taken
at
a
depth
between
3
and
5
m
from
a
weathering
profile
of
kinzigitic
gneissic
rocks
comprising
a
young
or
saprolitic
gneissic
residual
soil
belonging
to
the
pedological
horizon
C.
At
this
depth
structural
macroscopic
features
from
the
mother
rock
are
preserved
samples
taken
for
soil
characterisation
show
randomly
distributed
grey
and
white
facies
the
former
prevailing
at
the
sampling
depth
The
grey
facies
of
the
soil
that
predominates
in
the
weathering
profile
is
sandy
silt
material
with
quartz
and
mica
biotite
as
dominant
minerals
and
kaolinite
as
the
main
clay
fraction
The
white
facies
is
silty
sand
with
quartz
and
potassic
feldspar
as
main
minerals
and
gibbsite
as
clay
fraction
Both
facies
present
rather
low
clay
content
In
this
well-drained
soil
air
and
water
circulation
are
not
likely
to
be
easily
interrupted
by
biomass
increases
or
excess
water
input
Thus
it
is
probable
that
microbial
aerobic
processes
prevail
The
microbiological
evaluation
showed
significant
fluctuations
in
parameter
measurements
from
different
times
of
the
year
The
soil
presents
low
total
heterotrophic
bacterial
populations
low
degrading
activity
as
well
as
the
presence
of
culturable
gasoline
degraders
in
the
indigenous
microbiota
Similar
biomasses
were
found
in
both
facies
but
soil
microorganisms
appear
more
efficient
in
carbon
assimilation
in
the
sandy
facies

Effluents

that
aimed
to

A

for

of
a

provided
with
a

port
located
at
the

of
the

for
the

of

The
tank
was
packed
with

was

The
porous
medium
was
carefully
introduced
into
the
microcosm
using
a
funnel
and
rubber
hose
so
that
the
particle
distribution
would
be
as

as
possible
Water
was
also
introduced
carefully
at
the

and
drained
at
the
bottom
of
the
container
Quartz

Potters
comprised
the
granular

used
to

the

The
crushed

had
sizes
between
0.43

Contaminants
were
analysed
as
described
in

Section
2.1.3.1
Microbiological
analyses
detected
the
initial
impact
of
contamination
on
culturable
bacterial
populations
as
well
as
the
stimulation
of
metabolic
activity
caused
by
contamination
Growth
of
culturable
bacteria
was
inhibited
by
gasoline
as
well
as
by
ethanol-blended
gasoline
contamination
Fig
2
and
resumed
only
when
contaminant
amounts
were
reduced
Fig
3
The
recovery
of
culturable
populations
occurred
40
days
following
contamination
while
for
gasoline–ethanol
-contaminated
soils
it
was
not
observed
until
after
the
65th
day
This
delayed
recovery
of
culturable
populations
in
soils
containing
ethanol-amended
gasoline
suggests
a
longer-lasting
toxicity
of
soil
when
the
contaminating
gasoline
is
blended
with
ethanol
In
contaminated
soils
the
presence
of
contaminants
increased
microbial
activity
probably
because
of
biodegrading
activities
the
stimulation
was
higher
and
longer
lasting
when
gasoline
was
introduced
blended
with
ethanol
Fig

BTEX-contaminated
soils
present
a
50
increase
in
activity
on
the
second
day
after
contamination
levels
then
drop
below
the
initial
values
suggesting
that
the
population
must
re-adapt
to
the
new
conditions
Ethanol-containing
soils
also
have
an
increased
activity
on
the
second
day
2.5
times
the
initial
level
This
activity
lasts
until
the
10th
day
gradually
dropping
An
initial
immediate
degradation
of
ethanol
was
possibly
followed
by
the
degradation
of
BTEX
indicated
by
lower
levels
of
activity
similar
on
the
fifth
day
after
contamination
to
those
observed
in
gasoline-contaminated
soils
on
the
second
day
As
shown
by
residue
analysis
gasoline
compounds
were
detected
for
a
longer
time
in
soils
contaminated
with
ethanol
mixtures
Fig

It
was
not
possible
in
these
studies
to
link
soil
recovery
as
shown
by
resumption
of
growth
of
culturable
bacteria
and
the
return
of
activity
to
initial
levels
to
threshold
levels
of
contamination
However
measurements
of
degrading
activities
of
the
microbiota
decreased
rapidly
once
contamination
residues
were
no
longer
detected

In
sterile
soils
where
microbial
communities
were

analysis
showed
that
BTEX
residues
persisted
in
both
gasoline-
and
gasoline–ethanol
-contaminated
soils
whereas
they
were
no
longer
detected
in
non-sterile
soils

Gravimetric
monitoring
of
water
and
gasoline
volatilisation
from
uncontaminated
and
contaminated
soils
showed
that
most
water
and
contaminant
volatilisation
happened
rapidly
during
the
first
hours
after
the
introduction
of
contaminants
into
soil
No
significant
difference
was
observed
in
gasoline-
and
gasoline–ethanol
-contaminated
soils
Fig

Contaminated
sterile

between
5
and

loss
in
the
first
day
of
the
assay
the
weight
remaining
constant
afterwards
until
the
20th
day
These
experiments
showed
that
despite
ethanol
's
higher
volatility
volatilisation
of
contaminants
did
not
seem
faster
when
gasoline
was
blended
with
ethanol
Experiments
with
inert
soil
presented
two-phase
effluents
when
gasoline
was
introduced
blended
with
ethanol
the
upper
phase
A
was
composed
mainly
of
gasoline
compounds
while
the
bottom
phase
B
was
aqueous
This
phenomenon
was
not
observed
when
gasoline
alone
was
the
contaminant
in
this
case
a
unique
phase
was
observed

mainly
of
gasoline
compounds

As
shown
in

the
separation
of
two
phases
was
already
visible
in
the
porous
medium
during
contaminant
infiltration
In
effluents
from
assays
with
gasoline–ethanol
contamination
higher
contents
of
water
were
found
in
phase
A
than
in
the
effluent
from
standard
gasoline
experiments

When

less
BTEX
were

suggesting
that
higher
amounts
of
gasoline
could
have
been
retained
in
soil
However
the
amounts
measured
in

probably
underestimate
real
quantities
because
of
losses
by
volatilisation
during
sample
handling
Results

When
gasoline
enters
unsaturated
soil
several
physical
chemical
and
microbiological
processes
affect
its
distribution
and
persistence
Fig
9
The
presence
of
ethanol
in
gasoline
may
change
those
processes
substantially
as
suggested
by
the
results
of
the
study
described
in
the
present
paper
When
LNAPLs
are
introduced
into
unsaturated
soil
and
subjected
to
head
gradients
their
progress
displaces
air
from
soil
pores
characterising
the
advance
of
a
wetting
front
However
not
all
air
is
displaced
and
a
residual
amount
remains
entrapped
If
water
saturation
is
low
as
in
our
experiments
forces
acting
on
water
are
too
strong
for
it
to
be
expelled
A
fraction
of
the
mass
contaminants
may
be
retained
by
capillarity
and
soil
pores
may
be
partially
occupied
by
LNAPLs
while
gasoline
partly
solubilises
in
pore
water
Inside
soil
pores
water
is
the
wetting
phase
thus
interactions
between
soil
particles
and
contaminants
may
be
prevented
and
contaminants
then
form
a
film
over
water
and
are
more
easily
drained
or
volatilised
These
physical
processes
seem
to
be
largely
regulated
by
the
amounts
of
soil
residual
water
and
organic
matter
Haydn
et
al.
1997
When
ethanol-blended
gasoline
is
introduced
into
soil
air
is
still
dislodged
and
a
fraction
of
the
mass
contaminants
are
also
retained
by
capillary
forces
However
the
movement
of
gasoline
compounds
and
ethanol
changes
because
of
the
latter
's
high
solubility
in
water
as
well
as
its
solubilising
effect
on
BTEX
Adam
et
al.
2002
Corseuil
et
al.
1998
Rice
et
al.
1999
As
it
solubilises
in
soil
water
ethanol
changes
its
interfacial
pressure
causing
water
to
be
more
easily
dislocated
On
the
other
hand
BTEX
solubility
in
water
is
enhanced
because
of
co-solvency
induced
by
ethanol
Rice
et
al.
1999
Therefore
the
properties
and
behaviour
of
water
laden
with
gasoline
change
as
well
as
the
forces
acting
on
soil–water–gasoline
interfaces
Thus
BTEX-containing
water
is
drained
in
much
more
important
proportions
This
results
in
such
elevated
amounts
of
BTEX
in
the
effluent
that
gasoline-laden
water
and
gasoline
compounds
would
separate
in
two
phases
as
observed
in
our
tank
experiments
Despite
the
higher
solubilisation
of
benzene
in
soil
water
in
the
presence
of
ethanol
this
difference
between
the
two
situations
standard
vs.
amended-gasoline
tends
to
decrease
with
increasing
soil
water
saturation
the
lower
the
amounts
of
water
the
higher
the
relative
amounts
of
BTEX
that
are
solubilised
in
soil
water
because
of
ethanol

As
contaminants
progress
inside
the
soil
they
undergo
volatilisation
retention
and
biodegradation
Contamination
residues
were
detected
in
ethanol-containing
soils
for
a
longer
period
than
in
gasoline-contaminated
ones
which
could
be
explained
mainly
by
differences
in
contaminant
bioavailability
leading
to
different
degradation
rates
Volatilisation
may
contribute
to
the
disappearance
of
contaminants
however
if
it
were
the
determining
factor
residues
would
disappear
faster
from
ethanol-contaminated
soils
because
of
a
slightly
increased
vapour
pressure
in
amended
gasoline
Also
if
volatilisation
was
the
only
cause
for
the
loss
of
contaminants
similar
amounts
of
residues
or
none
would
have
been
detected
in
sterile
and
in
non-sterile
soils
in
contrast
with
our
studies
Volatilisation
of
gasoline
from
natural
structured
soil
showed
the
role
of
soil
water
content
in
this
process
Standard
gasoline
tends
to
volatilise
more
easily
from
soils
with
higher
water
content
as
water
does
not
allow
contact
or
interaction
between
gasoline
and
soil
particles
When
gasoline
is
blended
to
ethanol
the
solubilising
effect
of
the
latter
on
BTEX
modifies
water
characteristics
as
it
becomes
laden
with
BTEX
Therefore
the
remaining
unsolubilised
gasoline–ethanol
mixture
may
volatilise
more
easily
as
more
BTEX
are
retained
in
soil
water
An
easier
and
faster
volatilisation
would
also
be
expected
for
ethanol-blended
gasoline
because
of
a
higher
vapour
pressure
caused
by
ethanol
Ethanol
addition
to
gasoline
can
increase
its
vapour
pressure
from
62
to
68.9
kPa
depending
on
the
ratio
of
the
two
components
as
well
as
on
the
amount
of
ethanol
in
the
mixture
Hammel-Smith
et
al.

Ulrich
1999
As
shown
by
Pumphrey
et
al
2000
gasoline
vapour
pressure
was
initially
increased
by
the
addition
of
different
alcohols
but
it
decreased
when
using
higher
alcohol
proportions
For
gasoline
containing
20
to
25
ethanol
v/v
the
observed
increase
in
vapour
pressure
was
around
7
The
maximum
increase
is
observed
for
the
10
v/v
mixture
therefore
not
relevant
for
Brazilian
mixtures
which
is
substantiated
by
our
results
In
experiments
with
natural
soil
loss
of
contaminants
by
volatilisation
seems
to
happen
very
rapidly
taking
place
mostly
during
the
first
hours
to
the
first
days
after
contamination
according
to
the
size
of
the
soil
sample
slightly
higher
from
BTEX-contaminated
soils
In
our
experiments
no
significant
difference
p
0.125
was
observed
in
BTEX
volatilisation
in
the
hours
following
contamination
between
systems
with
and
without
ethanol
showing
that
a
possible
increase
in
vapour
pressure
was
not
relevant
Other
studies
with
sandy
soil
and
ethanol-blended
gasoline
have
shown
that
volatilisation
is
responsible
for
more
carbon
removal
than
biodegradation
of
gasoline
compounds
in
unsaturated
soil
while
biodegradation
seemed
to
be
the
main
mechanism
involved
in
the
disappearance
of
ethanol
Dakhel
et
al.
2003
Our
results
suggest
that
soil
components
other
than
sand
may
affect
BTEX
retention
and
thus
further
promote
their
biodegradation
A
higher
retention
of
BTEX
in
the
soil
matrix
was
observed
in
natural
as
well
as
in
inert
soil
for
ethanol-amended
gasoline
In
sterile
dried
natural
soils
where
no
biodegradation
occurred
BTEX
were
still
detectable
in
soil
after
33
days
in
slightly
higher
amounts
in
BTEX–ethanol
-contaminated
soil
Differences
in
BTEX
amounts
between
BTEX-contaminated
and
BTEX–ethanol
-contaminated
soils
were
very
close
to
significance

The
tank
experiments
with
unsaturated
inert
porous
medium
showed
different
behaviours
for
contaminant
infiltration
and
percolation
when
standard
or
ethanol-blended
gasoline
was
introduced
Higher
amounts
of
water
in
the
effluents
from
amended
gasoline
percolation
through
soil
indicate
that
the
presence
of
ethanol
leads
to
a
more
important
displacement
of
soil
residual
water
In
soils
with
low
water
content
around
5
weight
high
amounts
of
introduced
LNAPLs
would
remain
as
a
continuous
phase
over
water
and
could
be
easily
expelled
while
the
water
phase
would
be
retained
on
soil
particles
Hence
a
single

The
effects
of
ethanol
on
the
solubilisation
and
movement
of
BTEX
discussed
above
seem
to
enhance
the
retention
of
gasoline
compounds
If
ethanol
tends
to
remain
solubilised
while
gasoline
percolates
through
the
unsaturated
zone
McDowell
and
Powers
2003
its
presence
in
higher
amounts
could
increase
BTEX
retention
even
more
further
enhanced
by
the
low
water
saturation
Because
of
ethanol
's
high
solubility
in
water
it
is
probably
mostly
present
in
the
aqueous
phase
Column
assays
with
inert
porous
medium
show
that
over
80
of
introduced
ethanol
is
found
in
the
aqueous
phase
of
the
effluent
Siniscalchi
2006
As
no
detectable
expulsion
of
water
seems
to
happen
while
amended
gasoline
percolates
through
natural
soil
conditions
in
this
case
are
more
favourable
to
microbial
degrading
activities
Furthermore
ethanol
probably
remains
retained
in
greater
amounts
in
residual
water
in
natural
than
in
inert
porous
medium
which
also
stimulates
microbial
activity
Österreicher-Cunha
et
al.
2007
and
probably
biomass

da
Silva
and
Alvarez
2002
When
contaminants
enter
the
soil
the
structure
of
microbial
communities
shifts
as
the
strains
that
are
able
to
survive
and
eventually
use
the
xenobiotic
molecules
as
carbon
and
energy
source
are
selected
e.g
Daubaras
and
Chakraborty
1992
Edwards
2002
Thompson
et
al.
1999
Zucchi
et
al.
2003
Thus
as
the
structure
of
the
community
changes
extremely
specialised
microorganisms
thrive
and
spread
whereas
others
less
specialised
either
disappear
or
enter
resistant
forms
like
cysts
and
spores
These
highly
adapted
strains
are
less
likely
to
grow
under
laboratory
conditions
explaining
the
drastic
reduction
observed
in
culturable
bacterial
populations
after
soil
contamination
As
biodegradation
continues
soil
toxicity
gradually
decreases
until
eventually
attaining
levels
that
allow
for
less
specialised
strains
to
resume
growing
while
the
highly
adapted
populations
in
turn
fade
away

et
al.
2001

et

Results
show
that
the
resumption
of
growth
of
culturable
bacteria
took
place
around
the
40th
day
after
contamination
whereas
in
ethanol-contaminated
soils
a
30-day
delay
was
seen
for
this
recovery
Hence
monitoring
culturable
bacteria
allows
the
evaluation
of
levels
of
soil
toxicity
While
culturable
bacteria
disappear
non-culturable
microorganisms
in
soil
seem
to
be
actively
degrading
BTEX
and
ethanol
as
degrading
activity
increased
in
contaminated
soils
Those
with
ethanol-amended
gasoline
display
much
higher
and
longer-lasting
activity
probably
because
of
a
preliminary
degradation
of
ethanol
followed
by
that
of
BTEX
Gasoline
compounds
have
a
natural
origin
and
most
environmental
organisms
possess
the
ability
to
degrade
them

however
this
process
requires
the
activation
or
synthesis
of
specific
enzymes
which
generally
causes
a
lag
time
before
degradation
begins
Ethanol
on
the
other
hand
is
constitutively
degraded
meaning
the
enzymes
are
constantly
active
and
ethanol
immediately
enters
metabolic
biochemical
cycles
Stryer
1995
No
lag
phase
was
observed
before
the
onset
of
increased
levels
of
microbial
activity
as
seen
by
Dakhel
et
al
2003
The
amounts
of
ethanol
blended
to
gasoline
did
not
seem
sufficient
to
hinder
microbial
activity
although
it
inhibited
the
growth
of
culturable
bacteria
The
presence
of
significant
amounts
of
biodegradable
organic
molecules
in
gasoline
could
have
counteracted
the
toxic
effect
of
ethanol
by
stimulating
other
resistant
populations
Degrading
activity
remained
constant
in
uncontaminated
soils
throughout
the
33-day
assay
while
contaminated
soils
showed
increased
activity
higher
in
ethanol
-containing
soils
Thus
a
delay
of
processes
in
soils
contaminated
with
amended
gasoline
is
also
substantiated
by
measurements
of
microbial
activity
suggesting
a
preferential
degradation
of
ethanol
that
slows
down
BTEX
degradation
Statistical
testing
of
activity
levels
shows
a
significant
difference
between
responses
from
standard
and
from
ethanol-blended
gasoline
as
well
as
between
contaminated
and
uncontaminated
soils
p
0.05
Only
sterile
soils
still
had
detectable
amounts
of
BTEX
33
days
after
contamination
substantiating
the
role
of
microbial
degrading
activity
in
the
disappearance
of
contaminants
A
delayed
biodegradation
of
BTEX
when
gasoline
is
blended
with
ethanol
could
be
caused
by
a
depletion
of
soil
electron
acceptors
due
to
the
early
preferential
degradation
of
ethanol
BTEX
would
then
have
to
be
degraded
in
anaerobic
conditions
which
is
slower
and
less
effective
as
observed
in
saturated
soil
in
field
as
well
as
in
laboratory
experiments
Heider
and
Fuchs
1997
Lovley
2000
However
this
negative
effect
of
ethanol
on
BTEX
biodegradation
seems
to
be
easily
by-passed
by
the
addition
of
new
or
other
electron
acceptors
like
oxygen

aeration

Thus
the
benefits
of
ethanol-amended
gasoline
regarding
the
control
and
reduction
of
atmospheric
pollution
are
not
threatened
by
problems
linked
to
its
biodegradation
in
soil
simple
and
accessible
measures
can
be
taken
to
avoid
a
longer
persistence
of
gasoline–ethanol
mixtures
in
the
subsurface
Moreover
the
increase
of
biomass
caused
by
ethanol
degradation
in
the
saturated
zone
seems
to
lead
to
a
more
efficient
subsequent
degradation
of
BTEX
da
Silva
and
Alvarez
2002
However
a
better
understanding
of
these
processes
is
still
necessary
and
crucial
to
the
decision-making
involved
in
the

Conclusions
This
study
assessed
some
of
the
processes
that
regulate
the
biodegradation
and
distribution
of
gasoline
and
ethanol-blended
gasoline
in
unsaturated
soil
analysing
physical
chemical
and
microbiological
parameters
The
analysis
of
results
seems
to
indicate
that
the
effect
of
ethanol
on
the
fate
of
gasoline
compounds
may
actually
be
of
concern
all
the
parameters
monitored
suggest
a
higher
retention
and
a
delayed
degradation
of
BTEX
in
unsaturated
porous
medium
when
gasoline
is
amended
with
ethanol
When
gasoline
was
introduced
with
ethanol
more
BTEX
were
retained
in
unsaturated
inert
soil
natural
attenuation
of
gasoline
compounds
in
undisturbed
soil
took
longer
as
shown
by
chemical
analysis
of
residues
microbial
degrading
activities
were
much
higher
and
longer
lasting
in
ethanol-containing
soils
unspecialised
culturable
bacteria
unable
to
grow
under
high
amounts
of
contaminants
resumed
growth
much
later
than
in
gasoline-contamination
situations
The
co-solvency
effect
of
ethanol
on
BTEX
and
its
high
solubility
in
water
seem
to
cause
a
higher
retention
of
BTEX
in
the
soil
matrix
The
presence
of
gasoline
and
gasoline–ethanol
mixtures
in
soil
enhanced
microbial
enzymatic
activity
but
suppressed
culturable
bacterial
populations
The
results
presented
here
show
the
possibility
of
evaluating
the
impact
caused
by
contamination
as
well
as
the
reduction
of
soil
toxicity
by
evaluating
culturable
bacterial
populations
Bacterial
counts
showed
a
delay
in
soil
populations
’
reaction
to
contamination
in
gasoline–ethanol
-contaminated
soil
when
compared
to
gasoline-contaminated
ones
which
indicates
a
possible
preferential
degradation
of
ethanol
Microbial
degrading
activity
higher
in
soils
contaminated
with
BTEX–ethanol
suggests
it
is
a
better
tool
to
evaluate
biodegradation
activities
than
assessing
microbial
contingents
which
only
evaluates
shifts
in
numbers
of
culturable
populations
However
counts
of
culturable
populations
may
be
useful
to
rapidly
assess
soil
toxicity
due
to
contamination
Contamination
persists
longer
in
unsaturated
soil
when
in
the
presence
of
ethanol
Still
additional
and
more
accurate
chemical
analyses
are
necessary
to
better
evaluate
contaminant
residue
in
soil
and
measure
its
persistence
up
to
its
effect
on
microbial
populations
especially
culturable
bacteria
However
the
possibility
that
ethanol
may
delay
BTEX
degradation
should
not
invalidate
its
use
as
a
fuel
and/or
gasoline
oxygenated
additive
its
positive
effects
on
atmospheric
pollution
are
undeniable
as
well
as
its
value
as
an
alternative
to
fossil
fuels
Studies
to
further
verify
degradation
processes
are
necessary
so
as
to
determine
adequate
approaches
to
address
spills
of
gasoline–ethanol
mixtures
that
could
bypass
eventual
negative
effects
of
ethanol

Hydrocarbon-degrading

does
not
pose
a

to
invertebrate

adult
fish
populations
there
is
limited
information
on
its
effect
on
microbial

We
determined
the

the

The

The

from
two

were
analyzed
using
a

on
the
basis
of

Comparison
of
the
overall
microbial
molecular

suggested
that
in
the
Kuujjuaq
sites
contamination
negatively
impacted
diversity
whereas
in
the
Alert
samples
diversity
was
maintained
or
increased
as
compared
to
uncontaminated
controls
Extraction
and
sequencing
analysis
of
selected
16S

demonstrated
a
range
of
similarity
of

to

the

clustered
into

similar
to
those
of
the

The
coinciding
results
reached
using

analyses
reinforces
the
conclusion
that
geographical
origin
of
the
samples
rather
than
petroleum

was
more
important
in
determining

these

bacterial
communities
1Introduction
The
expansion
of
human
settlements
to
remote
areas
of
the
globe
brings
with
it
potential
pollution
problems
In
the
Canadian
north
a
large
source
of
environmental
contamination
results
from
oil
exploration
and
the
spillage
during
transfer
of
petroleum
hydrocarbons
needed
to
generate
heat
and
electricity
Temperature
is
one
of
the
most
important
factors
influencing
the
metabolic
activity
of
microorganisms
1
directly
affecting
rates
of
degradation
in
polar
regions
Several
groups
have
observed
that
petroleum
hydrocarbons
can
be
biodegraded
in
cold
environments
2–6
and
that
the
application
of
oil
to
previously
uncontaminated
soil
results
in
an
increase
in
total
bacterial
numbers
under
near
Arctic
conditions
7,8
and
cold
climate
regions
of
the
southern
hemisphere

Estimates
of
microbial
diversity
within
an
environment
can
be
divided
into
two
broad
categories
culture-dependent
or
-independent
methods
Analysis
of
total
community
nucleic
acids
extracted
from
an
environment
using
culture-independent
methods
permits
the
detection
and
phylogenetic
identification
of
fastidious
or
as
yet
uncultured
organisms
Denaturing
gradient
gel
electrophoresis
DGGE
separation
of
16S
rDNA
amplification
products
has
been
largely
responsible
for
the
description
of
many
environments
at
the
molecular
level
10–12
The
total
number
of
bands
visualized
in
a
DGGE
gel
also
provides
an
estimate
of
the
genetic
diversity
found
within
a
given
environment
10
and
sequencing
of
selected
DGGE
bands
enables
phylogenetic
relationships
to
be
inferred
11,12
The
assignment
of
a
metabolic
capacity
to
a
particular
band
from
a
DGGE
gel
as
inferred
from
phylogenetic
analysis
has
been
postulated
although
this
remains
to
be
demonstrated
13,14
Culture-dependent
techniques
such
as
Biolog-generated
community
level
physiological
profiles
CLPP
15
have
been
used
to
estimate
the
ex
situ
metabolic
potential
of
members
of
the
microbial
community
from
a
variety
of
environments
see
review
by
Konopka
et
al
16
CLPP
provides
an
indication
of
the
metabolic
diversity
present
in
an
environment
with
respect
to
the
number
of
defined
substrates
that
can
be
oxidized
15
Recent
studies
have
suggested
that
the
faster
growing
species
such
as
the
pseudomonads
produce
the
generated
patterns
and
not
the
numerically
dominant
members
of
the
microbial
community
16,17
The
combination
of
culture-dependent
and
-independent
approaches
in
the
analysis
of
an
environment
may
result
in
a
more
detailed
description
of
the
experimental

either

soil
microbial

responses
to

and
to

respectively
In
both
studies
consistent
differences
between
control
and
test
systems
were
identified
with
the
culture-dependent
and
-independent
techniques
In
this
study
a
similar
approach
combining
culture-dependent
and
-independent
techniques
was
used
to
evaluate
the
cold-adapted
microbial
population

that
geographical
separation
between
the
two

and
differences
in
the

sites
were
more

specified
by
the
bacterial
16S
rDNA
primers
was
amplified
in
all
of
the
soils
Separation
of
these
fragments
by
DGGE
produced
distinct
and
reproducible
patterns
comprising
20–35
distinct
bands
for
each
of
the
soil
samples
Fig

Several
of
the
observed
bands
appeared
to
be
shared
between
samples
but
the
majority
were
unique
for
each
sample
site
Bands
which
were
clearly
separated
from
neighboring
bands
and
were
easily

were
isolated
for
sequencing

bp
were

is
shown
in

The

contained
in

was
86.1

The
majority
of
the
isolated
bands
were
sequenced
with
relative
ease
and
minimal
background
interference
suggesting
that
each
band
represented
a
unique
microorganism
Several
isolated
bands
were
not
amenable
to
sequencing
due
to
high
levels
of
background
in
the

This
result
suggests
that
these

were
actually
composites

of
two

Previous

an

Although
changes
in
the
total

were
not
measured
in
this
study
a
similar
increase
in
the
total
heterotrophic
population
was
observed
at
the
contaminated
Alert
and
Kuujjuaq
sites
The
bacterial
molecular
diversity
in
the
soil
samples
was
estimated
by
the
number
of
amplified
16S
rDNA
bands
following
DGGE
separation
as
performed
by
Muyzer
et
al
10
Each
band
was
assumed
to
represent
a
single
operational
taxonomic
unit
38
Several
interesting
differences
between
the
Alert
and
Kuujjuaq
sites
were
noted
Banding
patterns
within
the
Kuujjuaq
sites
could
be
grouped
into
two
categories
K1–K2
contaminated
and
K3–K4
uncontaminated
Kuujjuaq
samples
K1
and
K2
displayed
a
moderate
number
of
bands
whereas
samples
K3
and
K4
produced
a
greater
number
of
distinct
bands
all
of
equal
intensity
This
difference
in
the
number
of
bands
suggests
that
the
microbial
community
within
the
contaminated
samples
K1
and
K2
underwent
a
decrease
in
species
diversity
as
members
of
the
bacterial
population
were
subjected
to
selective
enrichment
The
apparent
decrease
in
diversity
of
a
microbial
community
following
contamination
by
petroleum
hydrocarbons
has
also
been
observed
by
others
39–42
The
greater
number
of
bands
observed
in
the
K3
and
K4
samples
suggested
a
greater
diversity
in
the
bacterial
species
present
The
relatively
equal
intensities
of
the
bands
within
the
K3
and
K4
samples
is
interesting
although
the
importance
of
band
intensity
remains
to
be
determined
The
response
of
the
Alert
microbial
communities
to
hydrocarbon
contamination
as
observed
using
DGGE
appeared
to
be
different
from
that
of
the
Kuujjuaq
sites
Samples
A2
uncontaminated
and
A3
contaminated
produced
very
similar
patterns
with
respect
to
the
number
of
bands
visualized
yet
contamination
levels
were
significantly
different
A1
the
most
heavily
contaminated
sample
produced
a
similar
number
of
bands
as
the
uncontaminated
site
Ac
yet
both
of
these
produced
significantly
fewer
bands
than
either
A2
or
A3
These
results
do
not
follow
the
observed
decrease
in
species
diversity
following
contamination
as
in
the
Kuujjuaq
samples
or
by
other
groups
39–42
In
the
case
of
A3
it
appears
that
molecular
diversity
is
maintained
or
increased
in
comparison
to
the
uncontaminated
controls
A2
and
Ac
respectively
Similar
observations
of
stable
or
increased
microbial
diversity
after
contamination
have
been
noted
by
other
researchers

Alert

species
which
would
limit
the
variety
and

Following
contamination
at
Alert
the
number
and
variety
of
potential
carbon
substrates
increased
resulting
in
an
increase
in
bacterial
activity
which
could
ultimately
increase
bacterial
diversity
Local

also

from
the

Many

The
examination
of
Siberian
soils
using

47
and
molecular
methods
48
identified
the
prevalence
of
the
same
groups
of
microorganisms
although
some
significant
differences
were
noted
Many
members
of
the
low
G+C
Gram-positives
were
identified
using
culturing
methods
47
whereas
in
this
study
none
of
the
sequenced
bands
showed
similarity
to
members
of
the
low
G+C
Gram-positive
microorganisms
The
percentages
of
isolated
Gram-positive
and
Gram-negative
culturable
organisms
isolated
were
65.5
and
35.5
respectively
47
which
were
almost
identical
to
the
values
observed
in
this
study
despite
the
difference
in
approaches
i.e
culture-dependent
vs.
-independent

In
the
study
using
molecular

48
Proteobacteria
made
up
60.5
of
all

were
less

12
None
of
the
samples
used
in
the
Siberian

were

suggesting
that
these

may
represent
typical

found
in

environments
Comparison
of
the

K11
and
A11
revealed
89
and

to

making
it
difficult
to
determine
more
than
a

Sequence
K11
consistently
grouped
with
the

whereas
sequence

grouped
with
the
β
Proteobacteria
Despite
these

both

most
likely
represent
two
novel

Metabolic

of
the

Clustering
of
the
samples
into
four
groups
based
on
the
total

suggested
that
the
TPH
levels
were
not
consequential
in
influencing
the
overall
metabolic
diversity
All
of
these
clusters
possessed

uncontaminated
and
contaminated
samples
None
of
the
other

Table

provided
an
explanation
for
these
divisions
suggesting
that
other
environmental
factors
were
important
in
influencing
the
metabolic
diversity
of
the
microbial
communities
Cluster
analysis
using
the
rates
of
oxidation
for
each
substrate
suggested
some
unique
relationships
between
the
samples
and
the
rates
at
which
substrates
were
oxidized
Three
of
the
four
clusters
on
the
dendrogram
followed
the
trends
observed
in
the
total
number
of
substrates
oxidized
The
three
clusters
included
samples
A2
and
A3
K2
and
K4
and
K1
and
K3
These
groupings
were
not
completely
unexpected
as
cluster
analysis
of
the
rates
of
oxidation
is
also
influenced
by
the
total
number
of
substrates
oxidized
The
most
interesting
cluster
was
the
fourth
one
composed
of
samples
A1
and
Ac
These
samples
were
grouped
together
based
on
rates
of
oxidation
yet
the
total
number
of
substrates
oxidized
by
each
of
the
samples
was
significantly
different
61
and
26
for
Ac
and
A1
respectively
All
of
the
clusters
observed
were
also
independent
of
the
level
of
TPH
contamination
and
were
primarily
based
on
the
geographic
origin
of
the
samples
i.e
Alert
samples
grouped
separately
from
the
Kuujjuaq
samples
A1
was
the
only
sample
to
demonstrate
a
significant
inhibition
of
metabolic
activity
probably
due
to
the
level
of
TPH
contamination
TPH
contamination
above
25
000
ppm
has
been
shown
to
be
inhibitory
to
soil
microbial
populations
49,50
In
addition
it
was
observed
that
despite
several
different
treatment
protocols
the
rates
and
levels
of
hexadecane
mineralization
in
soil
A1
were
markedly
decreased
compared
with
the
moderately
contaminated

In
conclusion
the
combination
of
culture-dependent
and
-independent
methods
to
characterize
the
cold-adapted
soil
microbial
population
of
two
northern
Canadian
communities
impacted
by
petroleum
hydrocarbons
suggests
that
the
influence
of
contamination
is
only
one
of
several
factors
that
determine
the
selective
pressures
on
indigenous
microbial
communities
The
only
trend
consistently
observed
between
the
culture-dependent
and
-independent
approaches
with
respect
to
the
level
of
microbial
diversity
was
that
of
a
geographical
separation
between
the
Alert
and
Kuujjuaq
samples
CLPP
results
were
not
able
to
differentiate
samples
based
on
level
of
contamination
In
the
Alert
soils
hydrocarbon
contamination
increased
the
apparent
microbial
diversity
while
in
Kuujjuaq
soils
the
bacterial
diversity
was
decreased
16S
rDNA

high

Gram-positive

as
the
predominant
microorganisms
which
are
known
to
be
important
in
the

we

benzene
is
oxidized

Alternatively
benzene
might
be
oxidized
to
acetate
by
a
single
sulfate
reducer
according

However
in
such
a
scenario
the
dominance
of
Desulfovibrio
sp
in
the
sand
consortium
can
not
be
explained
It
should
also
be
mentioned
that
all
currently
known
aromatic-degrading
sulfate-reducing
bacteria
are
complete
oxidizers
probably
due
to
the
high
energy
value
of
acetate
Acetate
might
be
oxidized
by
sulfate
reducers
related
to
Desulfobacca

possibly
by

We
assume
that
in
our
communities
the
member
of
the
Cryptanaerobacter/Pelotomaculum
group
ferments
benzene
to
acetate
according
to

thus
being
responsible
for
the
initial
transformation

of
the
benzene

pathway
As
shown
for
the
sand-associated

on
aromatic

other
than

the
relative
T-RF
abundance
of
this
phylotype
decreased
or
fell
below
the
detection
limit
Fig

By
contrast
after
prolonged
cultivation
on
benzene
270
days
the
relative
T-RF
abundance
of
Cryptanaerobacter/Pelotomaculum
increased
remarkably
indicating
a
further
enrichment
of
this
organism
within
the
consortium
Fig

Although
limitations
of
T-RFLP
analyses
e.g.
differences
in
amplification
efficiency
or
non-PCR-based
biases
might
impair
the
elucidation
of
real
community
structures
relative
changes
in
community
composition
are
reliably
reflected
by

A
significant
increase
of
the
relative
T-RF
abundance
of
the
Cryptanaerobacter/Pelotomaculum
phylotype
after
cultivation
on
benzene
was
consistently
detected
with
different
restriction
enzymes
Fig

and
with
different
amounts
of
template
DNA
in
the
range
of
1–5
ng
data
not
shown
Moreover
in
a
toluene-grown
culture
of
ZzBS1-4
that
had
been
shifted
back
to
benzene
as
the
sole
carbon
source
neither
benzene
degradation
nor
sulfide
production
could
be
restored
even
after
90
days
of
incubation
on
benzene
data
not
shown
indicating
outcompetition
of
the
benzene-attacking
key
organism
Therefore
we
conclude
that
this
organism
is
responsible
for
the
initiation
of
the
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
on
both
sand
and
lava
granules
Whereas
we
provide
strong
indications
at
the
functional
role
of
the
Cryptanaerobacter/Pelotomaculum
phylotype
and
the
Deltaproteobacteria
in
the
benzene-degrading
communities
the
physiological
role
of
the
Magnetobacterium-
and
Sulfurovum-related
phylotypes
and
their
possible
involvement
in
syntrophic
interactions
still
remain
to
be
elucidated
These
phylotypes
were
the
predominant
members
of
the
communities
colonizing
either
sand
or
lava
granules
respectively
Obviously
different
properties
of
sand
particles
and
lava
granules
gave
rise
to
different
community
compositions
However
theoretically
both
groups
of
organisms
might
occupy
the
same
ecological
niche
in
the
two
habitats
According
to
the
hypothesized
degradation
pathway
and
regarding
the
high
relative
T-RF
abundance
of
the
Sulfurovum-like
phylotype
they
might
also
act
as
hydrogen
consumers
or
acetate
oxidizers

Molecular
characterization
of
bacterial
communities
mineralizing
benzene
under
sulfate-reducing
conditions
The
microbial
communities
of
in
situ
reactor
columns
degrading
benzene
with
sulfate
as
an
electron
acceptor
were
analyzed
based
on
clone
libraries
and
terminal
restriction
fragment
length
polymorphism
fingerprinting
of
PCR-amplified
16S
rRNA
genes
The
columns
were
filled
with
either
lava
granules
or
sand
particles
and
percolated
with
groundwater
from
a
benzene-contaminated
aquifer
The
predominant
organisms
colonizing
the
lava
granules
were
related
to
Magnetobacterium
sp.
followed
by
a
phylotype
affiliated
to
the
genera
Cryptanaerobacter/Pelotomaculum
and
several
Deltaproteobacteria
From
the
sand-filled
columns
a
stable
benzene-degrading
consortium
was
established
in
sand-filled
laboratory
microcosms
under
sulfate-reducing
conditions
It
was
composed
of
Delta-
and
Epsilonproteobacteria
Clostridia
Chloroflexi
Actinobacteria
and
Bacteroidetes
The
most
prominent
phylotype
of
the
consortium
was
related
to
the
genus
Sulfurovum
followed
by
Desulfovibrio
sp
and
the
Cryptanaerobacter/Pelotomaculum
phylotype
The
proportion
of
the
latter
was
similar
in
both
communities
and
significantly
increased
after
repeated
benzene-spiking
During
cultivation
on
aromatic
substrates
other
than
benzene
the
Cryptanaerobacter/Pelotomaculum
phylotype
was
outcompeted
by
other
community
members
Hence
this
organism
appears
to
be
specific
for
benzene
as
a
growth
substrate
and
might
play
a
key
role
in
benzene
degradation
in
both
communities
Based
on
the
possible
functions
of
the
community
members
and
thermodynamic
calculations
a
functional
model
for
syntrophic
benzene
degradation
under
sulfate-reducing
conditions
is
proposed

that

two
materials
with
distinctly
different
physico-chemical

Description
of
the
field
site
The
contaminated
aquifer
examined
is
located
on
the
site
of
a
former
coal
hydrogenation
and
benzene
production
plant
near
Zeitz
Saxony-Anhalt
Germany
The
main
contaminant
is
benzene
which
reached
the
aquifer
by
several
leakages
and
accidents
during
the
operation
of
the
plant
between
1960
and
1990
Benzene
concentrations
are
as
high
as
13
mM
in
the
source
zone
At
the
site
an
upper
and
a
lower
aquifer
are
separated
by
a
lignite
and
a
clay
layer
Both
aquifers
are
heterogeneous
and
hydrogeologically
connected
due
to
discontinuities
of
the
lignite–clay
layer
The
aquifer
matrix
is
composed
of
river
gravel
and
sand
sediments
which
contain
more
than
95
quartz
Both
aquifers
are
anoxic
and
sulfate
is
the
main
electron
acceptor

In
order
to
investigate
the
anaerobic
benzene
bioremediation
potential
of
the
lower
aquifer
two
column
systems
consisting
of
four
columns
connected
in
series
25
cm
diameter
and
6
m
length
each
were
set
up
at
an
experimental
plant
in
2002
and
continuously
percolated
with
anoxic
sulfidic
groundwater
from
the
lower
aquifer
One
set
of
four
columns
was
filled
with
sand
and
the
other
one
with
lava
granules
The
sand
was
taken
from
a
nearby
aerobic
sand
pit
and
sieved
before
use
resulting
in
a
grain
size
between
2
and
3.15
mm
The
lava
is
a
volcanic
rock
from
the
Eifel
under-saturated
with
silicon
oxide
The
percolating
groundwater
contains
on
average
300
μM
benzene
Toluene
ethylbenzene
and
xylenes
are
present
in
trace
amounts

were
set
up
Furthermore
two

were
set
up
using
the
same

They
were
autoclaved
three
times
at
intervals
of
at

Then
the
medium
was
exchanged
by

The
phylogenetic

of
the

derived
from
the
ARDRA
patterns
was
verified
by
T-RFLP
analysis
applying
three
different
restriction
enzymes
As
shown
in
Fig
5
the
T-RFLP
analysis
confirmed
that
the
most
dominant
phylotype
was
the
Sulfurovum-like
organism
which
was
even
under-represented
in
the
clone
library
The
relative
T-RF
abundances
of
several
Deltaproteobacteria
were
also
higher
than
the
percentages
of
these
phylotypes
according
to
the
clone
library
This
bias
might
be
explained
by
the
use
of
different
restriction
enzymes
and
by
the
different
phylogenetic
resolution
of
ARDRA
and
T-RFLP
analysis
As
ARDRA
relies
on
all
restriction
sites
within
the
16S
rRNA
gene
amplicon
it
also
distinguishes
highly
similar
but
not
identical
sequence
types
leading
to
an
underestimation
of
phylogenetic
groups
with
high
micro-heterogeneity
Nevertheless
the
proportion
of
the
Cryptanaerobacter/Pelotomaculum
phylotype
was
consistently
determined
to
be
5
and
7
with

Besides
benzene
the

derived
from
sand
columns
degraded
toluene
all
xylene
isomers

benzoate
or
acetate
if
added
as
single
substrates
coupled
with
the

of
sulfide
data
not
shown
Benzoate
phenol
and
toluene
are
putative
intermediates
of
the
anaerobic
degradation
pathway
s
of
benzene
For
this
reason
we
set
up
microcosms
spiked
repeatedly
with
either
benzene
phenol
benzoate
or
toluene
as
the
sole
source
of
carbon
and
energy
and
monitored
the
developing
community
compositions
All
compounds
were
degraded
under
sulfate-reducing
conditions
Fig

No
sulfide
was
formed
in
the
absence
of
substrates
and
no
substrate
depletion
was
observed
in
the
sterile
controls
data
not
shown
The
stoichiometry
of
oxidized
substrate
and
produced
sulfide
indicated
that
phenol
was
mineralized
For
benzene
and
benzoate
as
substrates
sulfide
production
was
slightly
lower
than
expected
for
complete
substrate
oxidation
for
toluene
which
had
been
added
at
the
lowest
concentration
no
production
of
sulfide
was
observed
However
care
must
be
taken
when
interpreting
the
stoichiometries
of
the
oxidized
substrate
and
sulfide
produced
in
our
microcosms
because
sulfide
can
precipitate
as
FeS
or
Fe2S
coatings
on
sand
particles
as
observed
previously

Benzene
was
degraded
at
a
rate
of
5.22
μM

Benzoate
and

were
degraded
considerably
faster
at
rates
of
33.68
and
17.5
μM

respectively
Likewise
toluene
was

faster
than
benzene

After
120
and
270
days
of
cultivation
on
the
different
substrates
DNA
was
extracted
from
the
sand
material
and
used
for
T-RFLP
analyses
to
assess
changes
in
the
phylogenetic
composition
of
the
consortium
due
to
the
degradation
of
the
different
carbon
sources
As
shown
in
Fig
6
the
Cryptanaerobacter/Pelotomaculum
phylotype
decreased
in
its
relative
T-RF
abundance
after
cultivation
on
toluene
benzoate
and
phenol
and
significantly
increased
when
benzene
was
used
as
a
substrate
The
relative
T-RF
abundances
of
the
Sulfurovum-like
phylotype
were
also
higher
with
benzene
compared
with
the
other
substrates
Members
of
the
Desulfobacteraceae
became
more
dominant
when
benzoate
phenol
and
toluene
were
used
as
substrates
Furthermore
a
larger
proportion
of
other
phylotypes
T-RF
that
were
not
assigned
was
present
in
the
cultures
grown
on
benzoate
toluene
or
phenol
compared
with
the
culture
grown
on
benzene
It
therefore
appeared
that
the
Cryptanaerobacter/Pelotomaculum-
and
Sulfurovum-like
phylotypes
were
outcompeted
by
other
groups
when
shifted
from
benzene
to
other
aromatic
substrates
whereas
the
Cryptanaerobacter/Pelotomaculum
phylotype
was
further
enriched
after
prolonged
cultivation
on
benzene
270
days

In

to

genus
Desulfotomaculum
Pelotomaculum
and
Cryptanaerobacter
species
do
not
use

It
has
been
hypothesized
that
these
genera
also
termed
Desulfotomaculum

Ih
have
lost
their
ancestral
ability
of
sulfate
respiration
as
they
adopted
a
syntrophic
lifestyle
to
thrive
in
methanogenic
environments
Imachi
et

2006
Assuming
that
the
Cryptanaerobacter/Pelotomaculum
phylotype
detected
in
the
lava-
and
sand-associated
communities
has
conserved
the
ability
to
reduce
sulfate
it
might
be
able
to
oxidize
benzene
completely
Although
we
can
not
rule
out
this
possibility
altogether
it
appears
rather
unlikely
considering
the
communities
composition
As
explained
below
we
suggest
that
this
Pelotomaculum/Cryptanaerobacter-like
phylotype
represents
a
syntrophic
organism
responsible
for
the
initiation
of
the
observed
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
The
dominant
phylotype
in
the
clone
library
generated
from
the
lava
granules
was
a
member
of
the
Nitrospira
phylum
related
to
the
genus
Magnetobacterium
Because
most
relatives
described
hitherto
are
environmental
clones
that
have
not
been
cultivated
so
far
the
possible
physiological
function
of
the
Magnetobacterium-like
phylotype
in
the
lava
community
remains
unknown

with
an

Recently
in
a

experiment
with

Magnetobacterium-like
organisms
were
found
to
metabolize
acetate
in
a
methanogenic

et

The
physiological
role
of
the
Sulfurovum-like
phylotype
which
dominated
the
sand-derived
microcosms
is
not
clear
either
As
for
the
Magnetobacterium
group
most
sequences
found
for
Sulfurovum
relatives
stem
from
environmental
clones
and
not
from
cultivated
species
Members
of
this
genus
were
often
found
in
sulfidic
habitats
Campbell
et
al.

A
highly
similar
phylotype
was

from

Zhang
et

Besides
clones
from
various
sulfidic
habitats
such
as
hydrothermal
vents
springs
and
cave
streams
a
phylotype
retrieved
from
a
benzene-mineralizing
consortium
Phelps
et
al.
1998
was
also
affiliated
to
this
group
In
the
clone
library
from
the
sand
particles
sequences
affiliated
to
several
genera
of
sulfate-reducing
Deltaproteobacteria
were
detected
For
most
of
these
phylotypes
related
cultivated
species
have
been
described
Fig

The
most
abundant
Deltaproteobacterium
belongs
to
the
genus
Desulfovibrio
which
comprises
physiologically
versatile
sulfate
reducers
known
for
their
capability
to
consume
hydrogen
very
efficiently
Cord-Ruwisch
et
al.
1988
Bak
Pfennig

Hence
Desulfovibrio
spp
are
typical
hydrogenotrophs
in
syntrophic
associations
under
sulfate-reducing
conditions
e.g
Elshahed
et

Also
Desulfobulbus

are
generally
very
versatile
and
can
grow
on
a
wide

of

including

Laanbroek
et

Lien
et

Desulfovibrio
and
Desulfobulbus
species
are
not
known
for
acetate
oxidation
incomplete
oxidizers
Desulfobacca-like
sequences
were
detected
on
both
sand
particles
and
lava
granules
The
only
described
species
Desulfobacca
acetoxidans
is
specialized
on
the
metabolization
of
acetate
and
can
even
outcompete
acetoclastic
methanogens
Oude
Elferink
et
al.
1999
Furthermore
the
occurrence
of
several
sequences
related
to
Desulfuromonas
acetexigens
in
the
sand
consortium
indicates
a
function
in
acetate
degradation
because
D.
acetexigens
uses
exclusively
acetate
as
the
sole
source
of
carbon
and
energy
Finster
et
al.
1994
Several
phylotypes
of
the
sand
consortium
were
related
to
Desulfobacterium
and
Desulfobacula
spp
Species
of
these
genera
are
known
to
degrade
aromatics
completely
hence
they
are
also
able
to
oxidize
acetate
Desulfobacteraceae
are
involved
in
the
degradation
of
other
aromatic
substrates
used
by
the
sand
consortium
ZzBs1-4
as
reflected
by
higher
relative
T-RF
abundances
after
growth
on
toluene
phenol
and
benzoate

As
explained
below
we
suggest
that
the
mentioned
phylotypes
affiliated
to
sulfate-reducing
Deltaproteobacteria
are
mainly
responsible
for
hydrogen
and
acetate
oxidation
coupled
to
sulfate
reduction
in
the
course
of
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
Sequences
affiliated
to
the
genus
Syntrophus
were
mainly
detected
in
the
lava-derived
clone
library
Syntrophus
spp
have
been
shown
to
grow
syntrophically
on
benzoate
in
coculture
with
hydrogenotrophic
sulfate
reducers
or
methanogens
Mountfort
et
al.

et
al.

but
possibly
they
are
also
capable
of
syntrophic
acetate
oxidation
as
shown
recently
in
microcosm
experiments
with
13C-labeled

Phylogenetic
diversity
of
the
lava-
and
sand-associated
consortia
compared
with
other
benzene-degrading
consortia
Bacterial
communities
of
sediment-free
benzene-degrading
enrichment
cultures
were
examined
by
several
authors
Phelps
et
al
1998
and
Musat
Widdel
2008
investigated
cultures
originally
enriched
from
marine
sediments
under
sulfate-reducing
conditions
The
consortium
of
Musat
Widdel
2008
consists
only
of
Deltaproteobacteria
and
the
dominant
phylotype
is
a
Desulfobacterium
species
The
authors
postulate
that
this
organism
is
solely
responsible
for
benzene
mineralization
in
their
culture
A
clone
closely
related
to
this
phylotype
named
SB-21
had
been
described
before
by
Phelps
et
al
1998
in
a
sulfate-reducing
benzene-degrading
consortium
Ulrich
Edwards
2003
investigated
the
community
structure
of
a
methanogenic
consortium
originally
enriched
from
the
sediment
of
a
contaminated
aquifer
which
first
used
sulfate
as
an
electron
acceptor
before
switching
to
methanogenesis
A
Desulfobacterium
species
and
a
member
of
the
Peptococcaceae
were
the
dominant
phylotypes
however
it
was
not
clear
which
of
both
species
attacks
benzene
initially
Recently
Kunapuli
et
al
2007
characterized
the
community
structure
of
a
benzene-degrading
iron-reducing
consortium
by
stable
isotope
probing
A
member
of
the
Peptococcaceae
was
shown
to
assimilate
benzene
primarily
but
also
a
member
of
the
Desulfobulbaceae
and
members
of
the
Actinobacteria
were
prominent
indicating
a
syntrophic
relationship
during
the
course
of
benzene
degradation
Compared
with
the
consortia
described
above
the
sand-
and
lava-associated
communities
are
more
diverse
and
comprise
only
a
small
proportion
of
Desulfobacteraceae
In
the
consortium
ZzBs1-4
the
proportion
of
Desulfobacteraceae
increased
after
the
shift
from
benzene
to
toluene
phenol
or
benzoate
Fig
6
In
contrast
to
the
consortia
described
above
ZzBs1-4
contains
a
large
proportion
of
other
Deltaproteobacteria
like
Desulfovibrio
which
are
not
assumed
to
use
aromatic
substrates
and
other
bacteria
not
known
as
sulfate
reducers
Similarly
in
the
lava-associated
community
only
a
small
proportion
of
Deltaproteobacteria
was
detected
Except
for
the
Cryptanaerobacter/Pelotomaculum
phylotype
both
communities
are
very
different
in
their
phylogenetic
composition
although
they
were
inoculated
with
the
same
groundwater
These
results
form
the
basis
for
our
hypothesis
that
benzene
is
not
degraded
by
single
sulfate
reducers
in
the
sand-
and
lava-associated
communities
but
by
syntrophic
interactions
of
several
different
organisms
We
suggest
that
only
one
phylotype
originating
from
the
groundwater
percolating
the
column
system
can
initially
attack
benzene
in
our
communities
If
this
phylotype
could
metabolize
benzene
completely
one
would
expect
an
aromatic-degrading
organism
using
sulfate
as
an
electron
acceptor
likely
a
phylotype
related
to
other
typical
aromatic-degrading
sulfate
reducers
Because
no
other
organisms
could
grow
under
such
circumstances
in
considerable
amounts
besides
the
benzene
degrader
the
respective
phylotype
should
be
dominant
≥50
in
community
analyses
as
observed
for
example
by
Musat
Widdel
2008
–
but
this
is
not
the
case
in
our
consortia
Therefore
we
postulate
that
a
member
of
the
Cryptanaerobacter/Pelotomaculum
group
is
responsible
for
the
initial
attack
of
benzene
in
our
enrichments
Interestingly
a
member
of
the
family
Peptococcaceae
dominated
in
the
aquifer-derived
methanogenic
benzene-degrading
enrichment
culture
examined
by
Ulrich
Edwards
2003
It
might
be
capable
of
attacking
benzene
as
well
as
postulated
recently
for
a
member
of
the
Peptococcaceae
in
a
consortium
growing
on
benzene
under
iron-reducing
conditions
Kunapuli
et
al.
2007
Aquifers
are
rather
oligotrophic
environments
and
are
characterized
by
conditions
that
favor
slow-growing
organisms
with
low
energy
demands
The
capability
to
survive
long
starvation
periods
as
well
as
an
independence
from
specific
electron
acceptors
might
be
favorable
Spore-forming
fermenters
degrading
aromatic
compounds
in
syntrophic
association
with
methanogens
sulfate-reducers
or
iron-reducers
might
be
indigenous
in
subsurface
sediments
and
thus
predestined
to
develop
in
benzene-polluted
aquifers
at
least
in
the
sulfidic
methanogenic
or
iron-reducing
zones
Thermodynamic
considerations
and
a
functional
model
for
syntrophic
benzene
degradation
under
sulfate-reducing
conditions
The
mineralization
of
benzene
with
sulfate
as
an
electron
acceptor
is
thermodynamically
favorable
as
it
allows
synthesizing
up
to
three
ATP
at
60
kJ

As
reasoned
above
we
assume
that
a
syntrophic
association
rather
than
a
single
member
of
our
communities
mineralizes
benzene
Support
for
the
involvement
of
syntrophic
associations
in
benzene
degradation
by
the
consortium
ZzBs1-4
emerges
from
the
observation
that
cell
detachment
and
disaggregation
at
intensities
that
commonly
do
not
lead
to
cell
damage
resulted
in
the
loss
of
the
communities
ability
to
degrade
benzene
The
initial
step
of
benzene
degradation
under
anoxic
conditions
might
be
a
methylation
a
hydroxylation
or
a
carboxylation
reaction
Caldwell

Ulrich
et
al.

Benzoate
is
a
very
likely
central
intermediate
in
the
anaerobic
degradation
pathway
of
benzene
because
all
known
degradation
pathways
of
aromatics
under
anoxic
conditions
are
channeled
into
benzoate
or
benzoyl-coenzyme
A

also
been

However
the
conversion
of
benzene
to
benzoate
is
thermodynamically
unfavorable

Hence
a
putative
anaerobic
benzene
degrader
can
not
grow
at
the
expense
of
reaction
2
but
has
to
oxidize
benzoate
further
to
gain
energy
for
ATP
synthesis
We
assume
that
acetate
and
hydrogen
are
central
intermediates
at
least
in
the
consortium
ZzBs1-4
due
to
the
presence
of
several
phylotypes
related
to
acetate-
and
hydrogen-consuming
sulfate
reducers
as
discussed
above

However
after

most

These

demonstrate
that

Introduction
Bioremediation
is
often
a
cost-effective
method
to
treat
oily
soils
and
petroleum
wastes
containing
biodegradable
hydrocarbons
and
indigenous
microbes
This
soil
cleanup
technology
has
been
successfully
demonstrated
in
laboratory
and
field
tests
for
refineries
1−6
in
oil
and
gas
operations
in
the
treatment
of
oily
sludges
and
at
pipeline
sites
to
remediate
accidental
crude
oil
spills
7−9
The
land
treat
ment
process
requires
the
management
of
appropriate
levels
e.g.
oil
hydrocarbons
as
percentage
total
petroleum
hydrocarbons
TPH
of
applied
waste
to
soil
aeration
and

as
required
and

to

by

and
Sims
et

A
petroleum
industry
review
based
on
such
land
treatment
practices
several
years
ago
indicated
that
70−90
of
oily
sludge
hydrocarbons
were
removed
from
surface
soils
having
loading
rates
of
10
000−50
000
mg/kg
oil

Loehr
et

studied
the
treatability
of
an
oily
sludge
in
field
plots
in
a
silty
loam
soil
and
demonstrated
that
60−70
of
the
initial
O
G
20
000−55
000
mg/kg
hydrocarbons
were
biodegraded
within
2−3
years
There
have
been
numerous
studies
and
reviews
in
the
literature
documenting
the
ready
degradability
of
crude
oil
hydrocarbons
alkanes
alkenes
aromatics
and
polars
in
soils
sludges
sediments
and
the
marine
environment
by
naturally-occurring
microbes
Experiments
have
shown
that
differences
in
the
extent
of
soil
hydrocarbon
biodegradation
may
depend
upon
soil
and
crude
oil
types
concentration
of
total

and

In
these

optimum

were
observed
in
the
first

There
have
been
few
definitive
studies
on

the

of

that

showed
that
93
of
the
saturate
and
79
of
the
aromatic
compounds
having
carbon
numbers
in

In
this
same
study
however
the
polar
fraction
was
resistant
to
microbial
metabolism
and
did
not
degrade
during
the
5.5-month

on
the
limits
and
extent
of
bioremediating
TPH
in
different
oily
soils
showed
that
90
of
the
alkanes
and
monocyclic
saturates
and
50−70
of
aromatic

were
degraded
The
significance
of
this
work
is
that
overall
bioremediation
effectiveness
was
dependent
upon
hydrocarbon
types
present
and
was
not
affected
as
much
by
soil
type
nutrient
fertilizer

microbial
populations
or
treatment
conditions

versus
static
soil
conditions
It
was
also
shown
that
saturate
and
aromatic
compounds
with
polycyclic
structures
were
most
resistant
to
removal
by
enhanced
soil
biotreatment
methods
The
apparent
recalcitrance
of
petroleum
hydrocarbon
fractions
may
be
due
to
factors
such
as
lack
of
bioavailability
inaccessible
because
of
soil
sorption
and
uptake
by
soil
microbes
lack
of
requisite
oxidizing
enzymes
and/or
steric
hindrance
for
enzyme
attack
and
toxicity
to
soil
microorganisms
Currently
there
are
no
universal
TPH
cleanup
standards
that
have
been
adopted
by
federal
or
state
regulatory
agencies
for

with
fresh

soils
have
varying

allow
the

24
Based
on
our
current
understanding
of
bioremediation
of
crude
oil-impacted
soils
it
would
be
difficult
to
achieve
those
low
cleanup
levels
at
most
sites
containing
varying
types
of
residual
weathered
petroleum
hydrocarbons
Doyle
and
Sweet
25
have
suggested
that
soil
remediation
standards
should
be
based
upon
the
BTEX
components
in
crude
oil
and
oil
products
fuels
-impacted
soils
since
these
are
the
most
mobile
leachable
hydrocarbons
that
could
be
transported
to
groundwater
Ecologically
relevant
criteria
for
estimating
the
impacts
of
oil
hydrocarbons
in
soils
are
also
important
end
points
for
risk
assessment
In
this
respect
ecotoxicity
bioassays
such
as
seed
germination
and
plant
growth
have
been
used
for
monitoring
treatment
effects
and
restoration
of
oiled
land
sites
26−29
Plant
species
have
been
proposed
as
indicators
of
soil
quality
and
toxicity
of
leachable
constituents
in
assessing
damage
and
risk
to
impacted
ecosystems

There
have
been
relatively
few
studies
however
describing
the
effects
of
oil
hydrocarbons
on
soil-dwelling
invertebrates
such
as
earthworms
nematodes
other
polychaetes
and
microarthropods
32−34
Earthworms
have
been
used
to
evaluate
the
effects
of
chemicals
and
contaminated
soils
on
animal
survival
growth
and
reproduction
35−39
Another
factor
in
ecorisk
evaluation
of
oily
soils
is
the
potential
for
dissolution
and
leaching
of
water-soluble
aromatic
hydrocarbons
like
benzene
toluene
ethylbenzene
and
xylenes
BTEX
into
the
vadose
zone
and
groundwater
environments
Laboratory
soil
microcosm
experiments
and
field
investigations
in
aquifers
have
been
used
to
study
hydrocarbon
source
migration
from
oil
and
fuel
spills
40−42
Fate
and
transport
methodologies
have
been
developed
to
validate
those
natural
attenuation
factors
e.g.
inherent
biodegradation
of
hydrocarbons
in
groundwater
evaporation
rates
from
spills
and
soil
sorption/desorption
rates
governing
the
dissolution
and
dispersion
of
petroleum
compounds
into
the
subsurface

Clearly
the
integration
of
chemical
analysis
ecotoxicity
and

data
is
required
to
properly
assess
ecological
risk
in
the

In
the
present

as
analyzed

The

show
that
the

were
significantly
degraded
in
low

The
overall
maximum
decline
in
TPH
was
similar
for
the
two
soils
but
different
between
oil
types
For
example
the
decrease
in
TPH
in
soils
with

It
is
possible
that

are
summarized
in

The
extent

of

was
higher
70−90
for
those

for
those
in
the
C23−C33

showed
that

were
from

These

indicate
that

will
contain
very
low

of
leachable
aromatic
hydrocarbons
Oily
soils
of
similar

that
are

would
present
a
very
low
risk
from

infiltration
to
the
subsoil
and

environment
since
it
is
well
known
also
that
BTEX
concentrations
of
10−5000
μg/L
are
rapidly
biodegraded
by

Earthworm
Survival
and
Microtox
Assays
In
estimating
the
environmental
toxicology
and
efficacy
of
the
bioremediation
process
on
oily
soils
we
chose
tests
utilizing
representative
soil-dwelling
species
such
as
earthworms
and
plants
In
the
earthworm
bioassay
survival
of
adult
Eisenia
was
determined
after
a
2-week
exposure
to
soil
These
results
shown
in
Table

Section
A
indicate
that
all
oily
soils
were
acutely
toxic
to
Eisenia
in
the
first
2−4
weeks
of
the
bioremediation
experiment
The
Norwood
soils
with
heavy
medium
and
light
oils
were
toxic
to
earthworms
for
at
least
8
months
In
contrast
all
animals
survived
in
the
three
Norwood/Baccto
oily
soils
after
only
3−5
months
treatment
We
previously
showed
Figure
1
that
the
maximum
reduction
in
oil
hydrocarbons
TPH
was
usually
after
3−5
months
for
both
soil
types
In
general
loss
in
earthworm
toxicity
appeared
to
correlate
with
optimum
hydrocarbon
biodegradation
with
the
exception
of
the
low
organic
Norwood
soil
It
is
not
known
why
toxicity
persisted
in
the
Norwood
soils
however
it
is
possible
that
residual
or
uncharacterized
petroleum
compounds
undegraded
or
incompletely
metabolized
contributed
to
the
acute
effects
on
Eisenia
survival
In
contrast
hydrocarbons
may
have
degraded
more
rapidly
or
were
sequestered
not
bioavailable
in
the
higher
organic
Norwood/Baccto
soil

The

bioassays
before
and
after
bioremediation
are
summarized
in
Tables

and

In
the
untreated
soils
seed
germination
for
corn
wheat
and
oat
species
was
inhibited
50−100
by
the
presence
of
25

000
and
4200−9600
mg/kg
TPH
respectively
of
medium

light
crude

In
contrast
seed
germination
in
the
bioremediated
soils
was
not
significantly
different
from
control
soils
that
contained
no
crude

Table

It
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
residual
TPH
in
which
germination
was
not
affected
in
both
bioremediated
soils
varied
from
7000
to
10

from

and
from

The

in

This
enhanced
effect
of
crude

on
plant

has
been
reported
in
the
literature
Over
75
years
ago
Carr

observed
that
soybean
yields
increased
at

in

of
a

In
our

of

seeds
were
significantly
reduced
20−70

After
8−11
months

were
significantly
improved
and
similar
to
control

However
some
plant
growth
inhibition
was
still
apparent
in
both
soil
types
with
the
heavy

This
reduction
in
growth
between

corn
wheat
and
oat
varied
from
0
to
40
from

These
results
indicate
that
undegraded
petroleum
compounds
other
than
BTEX
or

may
be
affecting
plant

The
phytotoxicity
of

has
not
been

in

Work

indicated
that

Huddleston

applied
a

that

had
no
adverse
effects
on
wheat
and
bermuda

germination
and
growth
These
latter
studies
suggest
that
hydrocarbon
phytotoxicity
can
not
be
predicted
and
varies
widely
with
oil
and
soil
type
concentration
and
plant
species
tested
Thus
the
majority
presence
of
microbial
PAH
degraders
during
the
late
stage
could
be
linked
to
the
higher
TPH
degradation
rates
observed
especially
with
more
recalcitrant
PAHs
Both
changes
in
PAH
bioavailability
and
enrichment
of
more
recalcitrant
PAHs
could
change
the
microbial
population
and
the

We
found
13
different
genera
that
were

Trojanella
Agrobacterium
Alcaligenes

During
the
first
stage
of
biodegradation
in
the
2M
treatment
and
the
4M
treatment
the
Sphingomonas
and
Azospirillum
phylotypes
α-Proteoabacteria
were
the
dominant
taxa
Table

Furthermore
the
only
two
coincident
DGGE

for
the
two
treatments
belong
to
these
phylotypes
B2-11
B4-12
and
B2-20
B4-24
Therefore
taking
into
account
that
with
both
treatments
high
levels
of
TPH
and
PAH
biodegradation
were
observed
during
the
first
90
days
these
phylotypes
may
be
linked
to
the
fast
biodegradation
observed
for
acenaphthene
fluorene
phenanthrene
anthracene
alkyl-phenanthrenes
fluoranthene
and
pyrene
These
results
are
consistent
with
those
of
Roling-Wilfred
et
al
29
and
Kasai
et
al
19
who
observed
strong
dominance
of
α-Proteobacteria
in
bacterial

in
recently

in
Nakhodka

During

a
high

observed
that
could
have
been
due
to
the

However
the

In

in
the

indicating
that
the
inoculated
microorganisms
did
not
compete
favorably
with
the
indigenous
bacterial
community
even
though
they
were
originally
from
a
PAH-contaminated
soil
36
and
the
inoculum
size
was
at
least
equal
to
108
MPN
g
of
soil−1
if
not
larger
than
the
indigenous
population
and
organisms
were
periodically
inoculated
throughout
the
experiment
Table

Moreover
the
microbial
population
structure
of
inoculated
soil
was
very
similar
to
that
of
the
soil
biostimulated
with
nutrients
during
the
first
45
days
in
which
the
maximum
biodegradation
rates
were
observed
Therefore
the
indigenous
population
changed
independent
of
the
inoculum
indicating
that
the
biodegradation
process
was
probably
the
strongest
selection
factor
for
the
shifts
in
the
microbial
population
Conclusions.This
study
showed
that
specific
phylotypes
of
bacteria
are
related
both
to
inorganic

to
the
soil
and
to
different
phases
of

and
it
highlighted
the
importance
of
understanding
how
interspecies
interactions
nutrient

and
changes
in
PAH
bioavailability
and

influence

TPH
and
PAH
concentrations
were
monitored
during
the
bioremediation
process
TPH
and
PAHs
were
significantly
degraded
in
all
treatments
72
to
79
and
83
to
87
respectively
and
the
biodegradation
values
were
higher
when
nutrients
were
not
added
especially
for
benzo
a
anthracene
and
chrysene
The
moisture
content
and
aeration
were
determined
to
be
the
key
factors
associated
with
PAH
bioremediation
Neither
biosurfactant
addition
bioaugmentation
nor
ferric
octate
addition
led
to
differences
in
PAH
or
TPH
biodegradation
compared
to
biodegradation
with
nutrient
treatment
All
treatments
resulted
in
a
high
first-order
degradation
rate
during
the
first
45
days
which
was
markedly
reduced
after
90
days
A
sharp
increase
in
the
size
of
the
heterotrophic
and
PAH-degrading
microbial
populations
was
observed
which
coincided
with
the
highest
rates
of
TPH
and
PAH
biodegradation
At
the
end
of
the
incubation
period
PAH
degraders
were
more
prevalent
in
samples
to
which
nutrients
had
not
been
added
Denaturing
gradient
gel
electrophoresis
analysis
and
principal-component
analysis
confirmed
that
there
was
a
remarkable
shift
in
the
composition
of
the
bacterial
community
due
to
both
the
biodegradation
process
and
the
addition
of
nutrients
At
early
stages
of
biodegradation
the
α-Proteobacteria
group
genera
Sphingomonas
and
Azospirillum
was
the
dominant
group
in
all
treatments
At
later
stages
the
γ-Proteobacteria
group
genus
Xanthomonas
the
α-Proteobacteria
group
genus
Sphingomonas
and
the
Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides
group
Bacteroidetes
were
the
dominant
groups
in
the
nonnutrient
treatment
while
the
γ-Proteobacteria
group
genus
Xathomonas
the
β-Proteobacteria
group
genera
Alcaligenes
and
Achromobacter
and
the
α-Proteobacteria
group
genus
Sphingomonas
were
the
dominant
groups
in
the
nutrient
treatment
This
study
shows
that
specific
bacterial
phylotypes
are
associated
both
with
different
phases
of
PAH
degradation
and
with
nutrient
addition
in
a
preadapted
PAH-contaminated
soil
Our
findings
also
suggest
that
there
are
complex
interactions
between
bacterial
species
and
medium
conditions
that
influence
the
biodegradation
capacity
of
the
microbial
communities
involved
in
bioremediation
processes
Polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
PAHs
are
a
class
of
fused-ring
aromatic
compounds
that
are
ubiquitous
environmental
pollutants
13
Microorganisms
play
an
important
role
in
the
degradation
of
PAHs
in
terrestrial
and
aquatic
ecosystems
and
microbial
degradation
is
the
main
process
in
natural
decontamination
Enhancement
of
this
phenomenon
is
the
basis
of
bioremediation
technologies
2
Microbial
degradation
of
PAHs
in
soil
is
restricted
by
various
factors
that
often
result
in
a
lower-than-expected
bioremediation
efficiency
One
of
these
factors
is
the
low
bioavailability
of
the
compounds
In
a
recent
study
1
we
described
significant
enhancement
of
the
biodegradation
of
high-molecular-weight
PAHs
and
alkylated
derivatives
of
these
compounds
from
Casablanca
crude
oil
caused
by
a
microbial
consortium
in
the
presence
of
a
biosurfactant
produced
by
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
strain
AT10
Another
important
factor
in
bioremediation
of
contaminated
soils
is
the
availability
of
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
which
allows
the
necessary
increase
in
the
size
of
the
hydrocarbon-degrading
microbial
populations
Taking
into
account
the
fact
that
each
contaminated
site
can
respond
in
a
different
way
to
distinct
parameters
that
affect
microbial
biodegradation
laboratory-scale
bioremediation
protocols
have
been
developed
in
order
to
determine
the
effects
of
different
conditions
30
In
such
feasibility
studies
addition
of
nutrients
biosurfactants
exogenous
inocula
or
other
additives
can
be
assayed
Nevertheless
in
almost
all
of
these
studies
monitoring
of
the
process
is
based
on
chemical
analysis
of
contaminants
A
better
understanding
of
the
diversity
of
the
microbial
communities
inhabiting
PAH-contaminated
soils
and
their
response
to
different
biostimulation
or
bioaugmentation
strategies
could
provide
clues
about
the
type
of
bacteria
that
are
able
to
adapt
to
and
exploit
such
habitats
It
is
well
known
that
the
majority
of
microbes
in
environmental
samples
can
not
be
cultured
at
present
in
laboratory
media
which
are
biased
for
the
growth
of
specific
microorganisms
5
34
In
light
of
this
molecular
biological
techniques
offer
new
opportunities
For
example
denaturing
gradient
gel
electrophoresis
DGGE
allows
us
to
directly
determine
the
presence
and
relative
levels
of
different
16S
rRNA
gene
amplicons
both
qualitatively
and
semiquantitatively
in
order
to
perform
a
community
analysis
15
Although
there
has
been
much
research
on
the
bacterial
community
structure
associated
with
bioremediation
of
different
kinds
of
environmental
pollutants
18
23
26
little
is
known
about
bioremediation
of
PAH-contaminated
soils
The
few
studies
that
have
been
described
to
date
have
been
performed
either
with
soils
with
low
levels
of
PAH
contamination
6
41
28
or
with
spiked
soils
32
and
there
has
not
been
accurate
monitoring
of
the
microbial
population
dynamics
throughout
the
biodegradation
process
To
assess
both
the
potential
of

in
a
heavily
PAH-contaminated
soil
and
the
effects
of
different
treatments
on
the
bacterial
community
structure
we
used
a
series
of
bioremediation
treatments
in
microcosm

An
old

Degradation
of

The

It
is

to
note
that

During

was
slightly
lower

In

the

Interestingly
phenanthrene

One
possible
explanation
for
this

the

conditions
without
nutrient
addition
than
in

Furthermore
the

rates
were
significantly
higher

10-fold

this

implies
that

not
compete
favorably
with
the
indigenous
bacterial
community
during

at

the

quite
different

it
seems
that
at
early
stages
when
the

was
dominant
an
exogenous
inoculum
did
not
affect

while
at

DISCUSSION
A
creosote-contaminated
soil
from
a
wood
treatment
facility
that
had
been
operating
for
at
least
30
years
was
the
subject
of
the
present
study
A
high
proportion
of
PAH-degrading
bacteria
at
the
beginning
of
the
experiment
Fig
1
and
the
absence
of
a
lag
phase
at
the
beginning
of
TPH
degradation
data
not
shown
revealed
the
presence
of
a
preadapted
PAH-degrading
microbial
population
in
the
original
soil
Effects
of
different
treatments
on
the
degradation
of
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons.The
kinetics
of
TPH
degradation
displayed
a
biphasic
pattern
for
all
bioremediation
treatments
This
behavior
may
have
been
due
to
a
number
of
factors
such
as
a
decrease
in
PAH
bioavailability
3
accumulation
of
toxic
PAH
metabolites
11
or
enrichment
of
more
recalcitrant
compounds
30
In
a
parallel
study
a
decrease
in
bioavailability
was
demonstrated
31
The
accumulation
of
metabolites
resulting
from
oxidation
of
PAHs
can
reduce
the
viability
of
several
PAH
degraders
in
addition
to
inhibiting
the
degradation
of
PAH
11
20
21
Nevertheless
this
probably
was
not
the
case
in
this
study
because
polar
metabolites
determined
by
gas
chromatography-mass
spectrometry
of
the
derivatized
polar
fraction
did
not
accumulate
in
the
soil
31
In
addition
leachates
from
the
soil
after
the
different
treatments
showed
that
there
was
a
reduction
in
soil
toxicity
as
determined
by
Microtox
31
Taking
into
account
the
finding
that
in
the
original
dry
soil
water
content
1.6
the
TPH
concentration
was
not
reduced
during
the
experiment
water
content
and
aeration
became
the
key
factors
for
soil
bioremediation
The
quantities
of
nutrients
added
in
our
treatments
taking
into
account
only
the
inorganic
nitrogen
forms
were
established
in
order
to
obtain
a
molar
C/N/P
ratio
of
300:10:1
The
required
quantities
were
added
at
three
times
during
the
experiment
in
order
to
avoid
inhibition
caused
by
a
drastic
osmotic
change
as
has
been
described
elsewhere
38
Recently
Atagana
7
described
the
ratio
used
in
this
study
as
optimal
for
a
creosote-contaminated
soil
As
shown
in
Table
3
our
results
suggest
that
nutrient
addition
had
a
negative
effect
on
late-stage
biodegradation
of
four-ring
PAHs
and
TPHs
The
presence
of
an
excess
of
nutrients
could
have
inhibited
the
biodegradation
of
high-molecular-weight
PAHs
In
fact
Rhykerd
et
al
27
described
a
reduction
in
bioremediation
of
a
motor
oil
due
to
an
increase
in
the
salinity
produced
by
NaCl
and
Braddock
et
al
10
attributed
a
reduction
in
the
microbial
activity
of
an
Arctic
hydrocarbon-contaminated
soil
to
the
salinity
produced
by
an
excess
of
nutrients
In
a
recent
study
Roling-Wilfred
et
al
29
suggested
that
the
addition
of
nutrients
implies
that
there
are
differences
in
hydrocarbon
biodegradation
rates
and
variations
in
the
microbial
population
Therefore
for
the
present
study
the
differential
microbial
population
shifts
due
to
different
inorganic
nutrient
contents
may
also
explain
the
different
biodegradation
capabilities
observed
for
biostimulation
treatments
with
and
without
nutrient
addition
Response
of
the

early
stages
0
to
45
days
of
the
bioremediation
process
the
addition
of
nutrients
caused
significant
increases
in
both
the

This

Bacterial
community

and
biodegradation
processes
were
examined
in
a
highly
creosote-contaminated
soil
undergoing
a
range
of
laboratory-based
bioremediation
treatments
The

of
the
eubacterial

of

and
polycyclic
aromatic

and
the
total
petroleum
hydrocarbon
TPH
and
PAH
concentrations
were
monitored
during
the
bioremediation
process
TPH
and
PAHs
were
significantly
degraded
in
all
treatments
72
to
79
and
83
to
87
respectively
and
the
biodegradation
values
were
higher
when
nutrients
were
not
added
especially
for
benzo
a
anthracene
and
chrysene
The
moisture
content
and
aeration
were
determined
to
be
the
key
factors
associated
with
PAH
bioremediation
Neither
biosurfactant
addition
bioaugmentation
nor
ferric
octate
addition
led
to
differences
in
PAH
or
TPH
biodegradation
compared
to
biodegradation
with
nutrient
treatment
All
treatments
resulted
in
a
high
first-order
degradation
rate
during
the
first
45
days
which
was
markedly
reduced
after
90
days
A
sharp
increase
in
the
size
of
the
heterotrophic
and
PAH-degrading
microbial
populations
was
observed
which
coincided
with
the
highest
rates
of
TPH
and
PAH
biodegradation
At
the
end
of
the
incubation
period
PAH
degraders
were
more
prevalent
in
samples
to
which
nutrients
had
not
been
added
Denaturing
gradient
gel
electrophoresis
analysis
and
principal-component
analysis
confirmed
that
there
was
a
remarkable
shift
in
the
composition
of
the
bacterial
community
due
to
both
the
biodegradation
process
and
the
addition
of
nutrients
At
early
stages
of
biodegradation
the
α-Proteobacteria
group
genera
Sphingomonas
and
Azospirillum
was
the
dominant
group
in
all
treatments
At
later
stages
the
γ-Proteobacteria
group
genus
Xanthomonas
the
α-Proteobacteria
group
genus
Sphingomonas
and
the
Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides
group
Bacteroidetes
were
the
dominant
groups
in
the
nonnutrient
treatment
while
the
γ-Proteobacteria
group
genus
Xathomonas
the
β-Proteobacteria
group
genera
Alcaligenes
and
Achromobacter
and
the
α-Proteobacteria
group
genus
Sphingomonas
were
the
dominant
groups
in
the
nutrient
treatment
This
study
shows
that
specific
bacterial
phylotypes
are
associated
both
with
different
phases
of
PAH
degradation
and
with
nutrient
addition
in
a
preadapted
PAH-contaminated
soil
Our
findings
also
suggest
that
there
are
complex
interactions
between
bacterial
species
and
medium
conditions
that
influence
the
biodegradation
capacity
of
the
microbial
communities
involved
in
bioremediation
processes
Polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
PAHs
are
a
class
of
fused-ring
aromatic
compounds
that
are
ubiquitous
environmental
pollutants
13
Microorganisms
play
an
important
role
in
the
degradation
of
PAHs
in
terrestrial
and
aquatic
ecosystems
and
microbial
degradation
is
the
main
process
in
natural
decontamination
Enhancement
of
this
phenomenon
is
the
basis
of
bioremediation
technologies
2
Microbial
degradation
of
PAHs
in
soil
is
restricted
by
various
factors
that
often
result
in
a
lower-than-expected
bioremediation
efficiency
One
of
these
factors
is
the
low
bioavailability
of
the
compounds
In
a
recent
study
1
we
described
significant
enhancement
of
the
biodegradation
of
high-molecular-weight
PAHs
and
alkylated
derivatives
of
these
compounds
from
Casablanca
crude
oil
caused
by
a
microbial
consortium
in
the
presence
of
a
biosurfactant
produced
by
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
strain
AT10
Another
important
factor
in
bioremediation
of
contaminated
soils
is
the
availability
of
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
which
allows
the
necessary
increase
in
the
size
of
the
hydrocarbon-degrading
microbial
populations
Taking
into
account
the
fact
that
each
contaminated
site
can
respond
in
a
different
way
to
distinct
parameters
that
affect
microbial
biodegradation
laboratory-scale
bioremediation
protocols
have
been
developed
in
order
to
determine
the
effects
of
different
conditions
30
In
such
feasibility
studies
addition
of
nutrients
biosurfactants
exogenous
inocula
or
other
additives
can
be
assayed
Nevertheless
in
almost
all
of
these
studies
monitoring
of
the
process
is
based
on
chemical
analysis
of
contaminants
A
better
understanding
of
the
diversity
of
the
microbial
communities
inhabiting
PAH-contaminated
soils
and
their
response
to
different
biostimulation
or
bioaugmentation
strategies
could
provide
clues
about
the
type
of
bacteria
that
are
able
to
adapt
to
and
exploit
such
habitats
It
is
well
known
that
the
majority
of
microbes
in
environmental
samples
can
not
be
cultured
at
present
in
laboratory
media
which
are
biased
for
the
growth
of
specific
microorganisms
5
34
In
light
of
this
molecular
biological
techniques
offer
new
opportunities
For
example
denaturing
gradient
gel
electrophoresis
DGGE
allows
us
to
directly
determine
the
presence
and
relative
levels
of
different
16S
rRNA
gene
amplicons
both
qualitatively
and
semiquantitatively
in
order
to
perform
a
community
analysis
15
Although
there
has
been
much
research
on
the
bacterial
community
structure
associated
with
bioremediation
of
different
kinds
of
environmental
pollutants
18
23
26
little
is
known
about
bioremediation
of
PAH-contaminated
soils
The
few
studies
that
have
been
described
to
date
have
been
performed
either
with
soils
with
low
levels
of
PAH
contamination
6
41
28
or
with
spiked
soils
32
and
there
has
not
been
accurate
monitoring
of
the
microbial
population

throughout
the
biodegradation
process
To
assess
both
the
potential
of

in
a
heavily
PAH-contaminated
soil
and
the
effects
of
different
treatments
on
the
bacterial
community
structure
we
used
a
series
of
bioremediation
treatments
in
microcosm
experiments
An
old

Degradation
of

RESULTS
Soil
properties.The
soil
was
a
loamy
clay
soil
containing
40
clay
28
silt
and
32
sand
The
total
organic
carbon
and
total
nitrogen
contents
were
4.2
and
0.15
respectively
the
inorganic
nitrogen
content
was
20
mg
kg−1
nitrate
and
2.8mg
kg−1
ammonium
and
the
phosphate
content
was
low
less
than
1
mg
kg−1
The
soil
had
low
conductivity
228
μS
cm−2
the
pH
was
7,5
and
the
water
content
was
extremely
low
1.6
Conversely
the
soil
had
a
high
WHC
27.7
possibly
due
to
the
high
clay
content
The
PAH
degraders
accounted
for
up
to
12
of
the
total
heterotrophic
microbial
population
with

contaminated
soil
had
a
high
initial
TPH
concentration
around
8,000
mg
kg
dry
weight
of
soil−1
Table
2
When
aromatic
compounds
were
examined
no
phenol
derivatives
naphthalene
or
alkyl
derivatives
of
naphthalene
were
detected
the
detection
limit
was
more
than
0.5
μg
g
dry
weight
of
soil−1
Consequently
we
presumed
that
a
limited
amount
of
PAHs
and
TPH
was
lost
by
evaporation
and/or
biodegradation
prior
to
soil
sampling
PAHs
withthree
and
four
rings
were
the
most
abundant
components
and
their
concentrations
were
between
100
and
700
mg
kg−1
The
polyaromatic
fraction
accounted
for
90
of
the
TPH
fraction
as
determined
by
gravimetric
measurement
while
the
TPH
accounted
for
85
of
the
total
organic
extract
The
TPH
concentration
did
not
decrease
significantly
P
0.05
in
the
untreated
soil
treatment
1M
over
the
course
of
the
200-day
experiment
whereas
there
was
a
slight
decrease
in
autoclaved
soil
treatment
3M
The
same
behavior
was
observed
for
the
target
PAHs
Hence
untreated
dry
soil
treatment
1M
was
used
as
a
control
with
which
to
calculate
hydrocarbon
biodegradation
for
the
different
treatments
and
to
compare
changes
in
microbial
diversity
By
the
end
of
the
experiment
200
days
significant
TPH
biodegradation
was
observed
for
all
treatments
treatments
2M
and
4M
to
7M
Table

Biostimulation
without
nutrient
addition
treatment
2M
resulted
in
slightly
greater
TPH
depletion
P
0.05
than
the
treatments
in
which
nutrients
were
added
treatments
4M
to
7M
To
study
the
rates
of
biodegradation
of
TPH
and
target
PAHs
biphasic
TPH
degradation
kinetics
were
assessed
because
a
single
first-order
decay
curve
fitted
to
the
entire
data
set
did
not
adequately
explain
r2
0.8
the
changes
in
TPH
concentration
observed
during
the
course
of
the
experiment
Thus
two
degradation
rates
k1
and
k2
were
defined
according
to
the
breakpoints
that
best
fit
the
data
for
all
treatments
k1
was
used
for
the
early-stage
group
from
0
to
45
days
of
incubation
and
k2
was
used
for
the
late-stage
group
from
90
to
200
days
of
incubation
Table
3
It
is
important
to
note
that
k2
was
1
order
of
magnitude
lower
than
k1
for
all
treatments
with
values
near
zero
for
treatments
with
nutrients
During
the
first
45
days
the
first-order
TPH
degradation
rate
constant
k1
was
slightly
lower
for
the
treatment
without
nutrients
treatment
2M
than
for
the
other
treatments
In
contrast
the
rate
constant
k2
for
the
late
stage
90
to
200
days
was
higher
P
0.05
These
rate
constants
are
similar
to
those
reported
in
other
studies
of
bioremediation
in
hydrocarbon-contaminated
soils
18
35
Two-
and
three-ring
PAHs
were
highly
degraded
80
to
100
during
the
first
45
days
and
the
biodegradation
rate
k
was
the
same
for
all
treatments
P
0.05
Tables
2
and
3
An
exception
was
1-methyl-anthracene
for
which
the
biodegradation
rate
was
higher
P
0.05
in
treatments
without
nutrient
amendment
Interestingly
phenanthrene
and
anthracene
were
not
completely
degraded
Table
2
One
possible
explanation
for
this
could
be
the
low
bioavailability
of
the
residual
quantities
of
these
compounds
present
after
day
45
31
The
biodegradation
kinetics
of
fluoranthene
were
not
affected
by
nutrient
addition
Table
3
whereas
the
early-stage
biodegradation
kinetics
k1
of
pyrene
were
slower
in
the
absence
of
nutrient
addition
P
0.05
The
degree
of
benzo
a
anthracene
and
chrysene
degradation
was
significantly
different
when
biostimulation
without
addition
of
nutrients
treatment
2M
was
compared
with
treatments
in
which
nutrients
were
added
treatments
4M
to
7M
Both
compounds
were
degraded
more
P
0.05
under
biostimulation
conditions
without
nutrient
addition
than
in
treatments
with
nutrient
addition
Table
2
Furthermore
the
late-stage
biodegradation
rates
were
significantly
higher
P
0.05
without
nutrient
addition
10-fold
higher
for
benzo
a
anthracene
biodegradation
and
threefold
higher
for
chrysene
biodegradation
Table

Benzo
a
pyrene
and
benzo
b+k
fluoranthene
were
not
significantly
degraded
P

The
percentages
of
PAH
biodegradation
and
the
kinetics
are
similar
to
those
reported
in
other
studies

Monitoring
of
the
heterotrophic
and
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbon-degrading
microbial
populations.As
shown
in
Fig
1
the
sizes
of
both
the
heterotrophic
and
PAH-degrading
microbial
populations
increased
2
to
3
orders
of
magnitude
between
day
0
and
day
21
for
treatments
in
which
there
was
nutrient
addition
treatments
4M
to
7M
whereas
the
population
subjected
to
the
biostimulation
treatment
without
nutrient
addition
treatment
2M
increased
more
slowly
1
to
2
orders
of
magnitude
at
21
to
45
days
After
90
days
of
incubation
the
sizes
of
both
populations
returned
to
the
initial
values
for
treatments
in
which
there
was
nutrient
addition
treatments
4M
to
7M
whereas
for
treatment
2M
the
PAH-degrading
population
remained
1
order
of
magnitude
larger
than
the
population
at
the
initial
stage
In
untreated
dry
soil
treatment
1M
the
size
of
the
heterotrophic
population
remained
constant
until
day
135
and
the
size
of
the
PAH-degrading
population
remained
constant
until
day
90
Between
days
135
and
200
the
sizes
of
the
two
populations
decreased
by
approximately
1
order
of
magnitude
Aeration
and
the
optimal
humidity
treatment
2M
resulted
in
a
remarkable
shift
in
the
proportion
of
the
PAH-degrading
population

Analysis
of

by

biodegradation
results
and

revealed
three

i
untreated

ii
treated
soil
without

and
iii
treated

Thus
the
effects
of
different
biostimulation
conditions
on
the
structure
and
dynamics
of
the
bacterial
community
were
analyzed
by

using
samples

and
4M
like
treatment
2M
but
with
nutrient
addition
taken
during
the
200-day
experiment
In
addition
the
effect
of
bioaugmentation
treatment
6M
was
monitored
by
DGGE
and
this
treatment
was
compared
with
treatments
4M
and
1M
The
bacterial
community
in
untreated
soil
treatment
1M
was
complex

and
did
not
change
over
the
course
of
the
200-day
experiment
Fig

However
biostimulation
treatments
with
treatment
4M
and
without
treatment
2M
nutrient
addition
resulted
in
shifts
in
the
composition
of
the
microbial

In
particular
the
initial

the

with

respectively
Both
biostimulation

a
noticeable
and
regular
separation
from

in
the

of
the
variation
in
the

during
the

Furthermore
for
each
treatment
the
PC1
value
was
increasingly
far
from
the
initial
point
as
incubation
time
increased
The
highest
second
principal
component
PC2
for
the
2M
treatment
corresponded
to
positive
values
while
for
the

treatment
the
values
were
negative

This
could
explain
the
distance
in

observed
between
the
biostimulation

of
the

over

Coincidentally
the
greatest
change
in
PC2
occurred
during
the
first
45
days
of

during
which

were
more
significant

It
is
interesting
that
only
two
bands
were
shared
by
different
treatments
Bands
B2-11
and
B2-20
were
identical
to
bands
B4-12
and
B4-24
respectively
Furthermore
these
DGGE
bands
displayed
similar
dynamics
for
the
two
treatments
and
exhibited
the
most
negative
PC1
loading
values
0.909
and
0.961
respectively
Their
dynamics
could
explain
the
migration
along
PC1
observed
for
both
treatments
The
treatment
2M
bands
with
the
highest
PC2
loading
values
were
B2-3
and
B2-16
while
for
the
4M
treatment
B4-17
had
the
most
negative
PC2
loading
value
Band
B4-3
which
was
the
most
abundant
band
in
the
early
biodegradation
stage
at
0
to
45
days
for
the
4M

disappeared
after
90
days
and
did
not
have
a
high
PCA
loading
value
Table

Nevertheless
this
band
could
be
important
in
the
biodegradation
of
three-ring
PAHs
because
at
this
time
these
compounds
exhibited
maximum

this

implies
that
the

did
not
compete
favorably
with
the
indigenous
bacterial
community
during
the
first

However
at
200
days
the

were
quite
different
Hence
it
seems
that
at
early
stages
when
the
biodegradation
process
was
dominant
an
exogenous
inoculum
did
not
affect
the

population
while
at
late

the

slow
it
could

DISCUSSION
A
creosote-contaminated
soil
from
a
wood
treatment
facility
that
had
been
operating
for
at
least
30
years
was
the
subject
of
the
present
study
A
high
proportion
of
PAH-degrading
bacteria
at
the
beginning
of
the
experiment
Fig

and
the
absence
of
a
lag
phase
at
the
beginning
of
TPH
degradation
data
not
shown
revealed
the
presence
of
a
preadapted
PAH-degrading
microbial
population
in
the
original
soil
Effects
of
different
treatments
on
the
degradation
of
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons.The
kinetics
of
TPH
degradation
displayed
a
biphasic
pattern
for
all
bioremediation
treatments
This
behavior
may
have
been
due
to
a
number
of
factors
such
as
a
decrease
in
PAH
bioavailability
3
accumulation
of
toxic
PAH
metabolites
11
or
enrichment
of
more
recalcitrant
compounds
30
In
a
parallel
study
a
decrease
in
bioavailability
was
demonstrated
31
The
accumulation
of
metabolites
resulting
from
oxidation
of
PAHs
can
reduce
the
viability
of
several
PAH
degraders
in
addition
to
inhibiting
the
degradation
of
PAH
11
20
21
Nevertheless
this
probably
was
not
the
case
in
this
study
because
polar
metabolites
determined
by
gas
chromatography-mass
spectrometry
of
the
derivatized
polar
fraction
did
not
accumulate
in
the
soil
31
In
addition
leachates
from
the
soil
after
the
different
treatments
showed
that
there
was
a
reduction
in
soil
toxicity
as
determined
by
Microtox
31
Taking
into
account
the
finding
that
in
the
original
dry
soil
water
content
1.6
the
TPH
concentration
was
not
reduced
during
the
experiment
water
content
and
aeration
became
the
key
factors
for
soil
bioremediation
The
quantities
of
nutrients
added
in
our
treatments
taking
into
account
only
the
inorganic
nitrogen
forms
were
established
in
order
to
obtain
a
molar
C/N/P
ratio
of
300:10:1
The
required
quantities
were
added
at
three
times
during
the
experiment
in
order
to
avoid
inhibition
caused
by
a
drastic
osmotic
change
as
has
been
described
elsewhere
38
Recently
Atagana
7
described
the
ratio
used
in
this
study
as
optimal
for
a
creosote-contaminated
soil
As
shown
in
Table
3
our
results
suggest
that
nutrient
addition
had
a
negative
effect
on
late-stage
biodegradation
of
four-ring
PAHs
and
TPHs
The
presence
of
an
excess
of
nutrients
could
have
inhibited
the
biodegradation
of
high-molecular-weight
PAHs
In
fact
Rhykerd
et
al
27
described
a
reduction
in
bioremediation
of
a
motor
oil
due
to
an
increase
in
the
salinity
produced
by
NaCl
and
Braddock
et
al
10
attributed
a
reduction
in
the
microbial
activity
of
an
Arctic
hydrocarbon-contaminated
soil
to
the
salinity
produced
by
an
excess
of
nutrients
In
a
recent
study
Roling-Wilfred
et
al
29
suggested
that
the
addition
of
nutrients
implies
that
there
are
differences
in
hydrocarbon
biodegradation
rates
and
variations
in
the
microbial
population
Therefore
for
the
present
study
the
differential
microbial
population
shifts
due
to
different
inorganic
nutrient
contents
may
also
explain
the
different
biodegradation
capabilities
observed
for
biostimulation
treatments
with
and
without
nutrient
addition
Response
of

early
stages
0
to
45
days
of
the
bioremediation
process
the
addition
of
nutrients
caused
significant
increases
in
both
the
heterotrophic
and
PAH-degrading
microbial

while

only
by
aeration
and

smaller
increases
in
the

of
both
populations
and
a
marked
delay
in
the
increase
in
microbial
PAH

Fig

This
difference
in
behavior
is
consistent
with
the
kinetics
of
TPH
depletion
observed
during
the
early
stage
Table

As
shown
in
Table

a
higher
TPH
degradation
rate
was
observed
for
treatments
to
which
nutrients
were
added
In
contrast
the
proportion
of
the
PAH-degrading
microbial
population
compared
to
the
heterotrophic
population
for
the
treatment
without
nutrients
increased
noticeably
at
21
and
45
days
and
reached
100
at
135
days
while
lower
proportions
were
observed
for
treatments
with
nutrients
Fig

In
addition
at
the
end
of
the
experiment
a
larger
PAH-degrading
microbial
population
was
observed
for
the
treatment
without
nutrients
Thus
the
majority
presence
of
microbial
PAH
degraders
during
the
late
stage
could
be
linked
to
the
higher
TPH
degradation
rates
observed
especially
with
more
recalcitrant
PAHs
Both
changes
in
PAH
bioavailability
and
enrichment
of
more
recalcitrant
PAHs
could
change
the
microbial

We
found
13
different

During
the

stage
of

in
the
2M
treatment
and
the
4M
treatment
the
Sphingomonas
and
Azospirillum
phylotypes
α-Proteoabacteria
were
the
dominant
taxa
Table

Furthermore
the
only
two
coincident

for
the
two
treatments
belong
to
these
phylotypes
B2-11
B4-12
and
B2-20
B4-24
Therefore
taking
into
account
that
with
both
treatments
high
levels
of
TPH
and
PAH
biodegradation
were
observed
during
the
first
90
days
these
phylotypes
may
be
linked
to
the
fast
biodegradation
observed
for
acenaphthene
fluorene
phenanthrene
anthracene
alkyl-phenanthrenes
fluoranthene
and

These
results
are
consistent
with
those
of

who
observed

During

a

In

indicating
that
the
inoculated
microorganisms
did
not
compete
favorably
with
the
indigenous
bacterial
community
even
though
they
were
originally
from
a
PAH-contaminated
soil

and
the

was
at
least
equal
to
108
MPN
g
of
soil−1
if
not
larger
than
the
indigenous
population
and
organisms
were
periodically
inoculated
throughout
the
experiment
Table

Moreover
the
microbial
population
structure
of
inoculated
soil
was
very
similar
to
that
of
the
soil
biostimulated
with
nutrients
during
the
first
45
days
in
which
the
maximum
biodegradation
rates
were
observed
Therefore
the
indigenous
population
changed
independent
of
the
inoculum
indicating
that
the
biodegradation
process
was
probably
the
strongest
selection
factor
for
the
shifts
in
the

Conclusions.This
study
showed
that
specific
phylotypes
of
bacteria
are
related
both
to
inorganic
nutrient
addition
to
the
soil
and
to
different
phases
of
PAH
degradation
in
a
nonspiked
PAH-contaminated
soil
and
it
highlighted
the
importance
of
understanding
how
interspecies
interactions
nutrient
effects
and
changes
in
PAH
bioavailability
and
recalcitrance
influence
the

and

Molecular

properties
of
hydrate-forming
C1–C5
hydrocarbons

to
bacterially-mediated

Hydrate-bound
methane
is
altered
by
bacterial
oxidation
as
indicated
by
enrichment
of
13C
and
deuterium
D
and
by
CO2
depleted
in
13C
The
degree
of
gas
hydrate
alteration
appears
related
to
duration
of
exposure
at
the
sea
floor
In
hydrate-associated
sediments
bacterial
oxidation
of
a
mixed
pool
of
hydrocarbons
yields
a
net
production
of
CO2
depleted
in
13C
Bacterial
oxidation
of
hydrate-bound
methane
and
free
hydrocarbon
gases
in
adjacent
sediments
could
contribute
to
gas
hydrate
decomposition
Some
thermogenic
carbon
in
sediments
could
be
recycled
via
methanogenesis
to
yield
a
net
production
of
bacterial
methane
depleted
in

The

was
intended
to
encompass
zones
of

from

Therefore
the

may
not
be
representative
of
the
entire

we
studied
nor
of

Each

This

suggests
that
the

from
which
the

The

Gas

An
inverted
steel
cup
with
sharpened

was
used
to
chip
fragments
from
larger

which
floated
up
into
the

The
cup
and
gas

were
transferred
to
a
pressure
vessel
containing
ambient
sea
water
After
sealing
the

was
used
to
transport
the
gas
hydrate
samples
to
the
sea
surface
at
approximate

Discrete

was
decomposed
within
the

on
the

and
the
resultant
gas
was
transferred
to
vacutainers
and
frozen
at
−20°C
Samples
of
sediments
generally
representing
15–25

with
the

Sediment

Abstract
Coastal

are
highly
sensitive
wetland
ecosystems
that
can
sustain
long-term
impacts
from
anthropogenic
events
such
as
oil

In
this
study
we
examined
the
microbial
communities
of
a
Gulf
of
Mexico
coastal
salt
marsh
during
and
after
the
influx
of
petroleum
hydrocarbons
following
the
Deepwater
Horizon
oil
spill
Total
hydrocarbon
concentrations
in
salt
marsh
sediments
were
highest
in
June
and
July
2010
and
decreased
in
September
2010
Coupled
PhyloChip
and
GeoChip
microarray
analyses
demonstrated
that

Introduction
The
explosion
and
sinking
of
the
Deepwater
Horizon
drilling
rig
on
April
20
2010
released
an
estimated
4.9
million
barrels
of
crude
oil

and
an
estimated
1.7×1011
g
of
volatile
hydrocarbons
4
into
the
northern
Gulf
of
Mexico
GoM
Crude
oil
reached
the
coast
of
Alabama
by
June
2010
and
after
approximately
one
month
at
sea
the
oil
that
impacted
coastal
areas
was
weathered
and
presented
in
the
form
of
oil
sheens
and
tar
balls/mats
5
6
Coastal
wetlands
are
among
the
most
productive
habitats
in
the
world
that
act
as
nurseries
for
fisheries
sinks
for
anthropogenic
contaminants
and
provide
protection
from
shoreline
erosion
7
Wetland
environments
are
highly
sensitive
to
oil
contamination
due
to
low
tidal
wave
energy
and
the
presence
of
marsh
grasses
that
allow
pollutants
to
remain
sequestered
in
coastal
sediments
for
years
8
9
Traditional
mechanical
remediation
processes
such
as
low-pressure
flushing
and
vacuum/pumping
may
adversely
affect
marsh
environments
or
irreparably
damage
these
sensitive
ecosystems
10
11
Two
coastal
marshes
equally
affected
by
heavy
oiling
from
the
Amoco
Cadiz
in
1978
were
compared
after
one
site
received
aggressive
cleaning
and
the
other
was
left
untouched
Fifteen
years
later
the
cleaned
marsh
showed
∼30
decrease
in
vegetative
area
compared
to
a
21
increase
in
the
size
of
the
marsh
that
did
not
receive
cleanup
12
Thus
in
many
cases
natural
attenuation
through
microbial
oil
biodegradation
processes
is
a
preferred
course
of
action
in
contaminated
salt
marshes
to
limit
or
prevent
long-term
habitat
loss
A
number
of
environmental
factors
can
enhance
or
limit
natural
attenuation
or
in
situ
bioremediation
of
oil
including
temperature
salinity
nutrient
availability
oxygen
physical
state
of
the
oil
and
the
natural
microbial
community
13
Biodegradation
of
hydrocarbons
is
enhanced
at
higher
temperatures
during
summer
months
when
microbial
activity
is
increased
and
oil
viscosity
is
lower
when
compared
to
winter
months
Tar
balls
and/or
mousse
are
less
viscous
at
higher
temperatures
and
have
more
surface
area
available
for
physical
breakdown
and/or
microbial
degradation
within
sediments
14
The
most
rapid
rates
of
microbial
hydrocarbon
degradation
occur
under
aerobic
conditions
when
compared
to
anaerobic
hydrocarbon
degradation
15
16
Inorganic
nutrients
e.g
nitrogen
phosphorus
and
iron
essential
for
microbial
hydrocarbon
degradation
are
replete
in
many
marsh
systems
due
to
land
run-off
Another
critical
factor
affecting
the
bioremediation
of
oil
is
the
structure
of
the
natural
microbial
community
Within
GoM
coastal
ecosystems
microbial
communities
have
adapted
to
hydrocarbon
exposure
as
a
result
of
chronic
release
from
natural
hydrocarbon
seeps
17
18
19
20
21
Thus
these
GoM
microbial
communities
represent
a
unique
contrast
to
those
present
within
coastal
ecosystems
that
do
not
have
exposure
to
hydrocarbon
release
There
is
a
paucity
of
information
regarding
the
in
situ
structure
and
function
of
salt
marsh
microbial
communities
in
coastal
GoM
environments
impacted
by
oil
contamination
To
date
studies
that
examine
the
microbial
response
to
the
Deepwater
Horizon
oil
spill
have
described
beach

and
open

27
environments
To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
salt
marsh
microbial
community
structure
and
function
have
not
been
characterized
by
high-density
PhyloChip
and
GeoChip
microarray
analyses
These
high
throughput
culture-independent
analyses
have
been
shown
to
identify
a
greater
microbial
diversity
in
environmental
samples
compared
to
traditional
sequencing
of
clone
libraries
28
Therefore
the
goal
of
this
study
was
to
employ
microarray-based
methods
to
characterize
the
changes
to

Discussion
Salt
marshes
ecosystems
are
highly
productive
and
biologically
rich
environments
that
are
sensitive
to
anthropogenic
contamination
such
as
oil
spills
36
37
The
overall
impact
to
the
system
depends
on
the
amount
and
type
of
oil
physical
aspects
of
the
marsh
and
temperature
The
Deepwater
Horizon
oil
spill
occurred
approximately
77
km
offshore
during
the
late
spring
and
by
the
time
the
oil
reached
the
Alabama
coast
6
in
the
early
summer
it
presented
primarily
as
weathered
tar
balls
and/or
mousse
collecting
within
salt
marsh
sediments
and
along
the
shore
We
detected
oil
in
the
Point
Aux
Pins
salt
marsh
sediments
in
June
2010
that
persisted
through
our
samplings
in
September
2010
The
amount
of
oil
that
affected
the
Alabama
marsh
was
heterogeneously
distributed
and
did
not
saturate
the
sediments
as
was
observed
in
areas
of
coastal
Louisiana
38
Oil
saturated
sediments
can
form
“
pavements
”
that
sink
into
the
subsurface
39
These
reduced
water-oil
interfaces
effectively
preserve
oil
from
microbial
biodegradation
and
can
remain
sequestered
for
years
Analysis
of
sediment
cores
collected
one
year
after
the
arrival
of
oil
in
the
Point

salt
marsh
detected
no
TPH
within
the
top
30
cm
of
sediments
data
not
shown
The
absence
of
“
pavements
”
within
this
depth
profile
suggests
that
the
heterogeneity
and
amount
of
oil
in
the
sediment
did
not
appear
to
favor
oil
preservation
and
may
have
been
a
key
factor
that
contributed
to
the
efficient
removal
of
oil
from
these
marsh
sediments
possibly
by
natural
attenuation
The
relative
distribution
of
the
predominant
bacterial
phyla
detected
was
approximately
7
Bacteroidetes
11
Actinobacteria
16
Firmicutes
and
46
Proteobacteria
Table

Dominance

the

and
a

impacted

23
Both
the
relative
abundance
and
number
of
OTUs
of
bacterial
phyla
increased
during
oiling
suggesting
that
not
only
did
the
relative
community
richness
increase
in
response
to
the
hydrocarbon
input
but
the
relative
intensities
of
those
populations
already
at
detectable
levels
responded
as
well
Members
of
hydrocarbon-degrading
bacterial
families
that
demonstrated
the
largest
increases
in
relative
abundance
between
June
and
July
during
the
oiling
of
sediments
were
Actinomycetaceae
Dietziaceae
Nocardioidaceae
Rhizobiaceae
Xanthobacteraceae
Erythrobacteraceae
and
Aeromonadaceae
Members
of
these
families
have
been
shown
to
degrade
alkanes
46
and
polynuclear
aromatic
hydrocarbons

Interestingly
several
hydrocarbon-degraders
detected
in
the
salt
marsh
such
as
Aeromonadaceae
Bacillaceae
Pseudomonadales
and
Shewanellaceae
are
also

to
form
biofilms
and/or
produce
biosurfactants

Ordination

the

primarily
on

Increases

July
when
oil
concentrations
were
highest
and
subsequent
decreases
in
September
when
concentrations
were
lower
suggest
a
rapid
microbial
response
to
oil
concentrations
In
contrast
both
Bacilli
and
Clostridia
demonstrated
significant

Classes
of

in

that
immediately
declined
when
the
oil
was
undetectable
Community
enrichment
of
Firmicutes
in
salt
marsh
sediments
has
also
been
observed
in
response
to
hydrocarbon
contamination
in
a
simulated
spill
study
59
and
may
be
used
as
an
indicator
of
the
later
stages
of
hydrocarbon
degradation
when
more
recalcitrant
compounds
such
as
PAHs
are
present
23
The
function
of
the
microbial
community
in
salt
marsh
sediments
also
changed
during
the
time
of
oiling
The
overall
microbial
community
functional
structure
was
significantly
p
0.01
different
between
Marsh
and
Inlet
sediments
during
the
months
of
June
and
July
when
TPH
concentrations
were
increasing
in
the
Inlet
and
decreasing
in
the
Marsh
While
total
functional
gene
relative
abundances
increased
12.7
in
Inlet
samples
between
June
and
July
in
correlation
with
a
44
increase
in
total
TPH
genes
significantly
p
0.05
decreased
by
25.2
in
Marsh

where
total
TPH
decreased
by

in
July
compared
to
June
Figure

Table

This
positive
relationship
between
gene
abundance
particularly
hydrocarbon-degrading
genes
and
TPH
suggests
that
community
function
was
driven
by
oil
concentrations
This
association
is
further
supported
by
an
associated
decrease
in
relative
abundance
of
known
hydrocarbon-degrading
bacteria
specifically
members
of
Alteromonadaceae
Colwelliaceae
and
Shewanellaceae
between
June
and
July
in
Marsh
sediments
Significant

were
observed

aromatic
carboxylic
acids
chlorinated

suggesting
that
these
genes
were
actively
involved
in

the

that

The
salt

vegetation
appeared
to
act
as
traps
for
the
oil
coming
ashore
Oil
was
visible
on

and
higher
concentrations
were
detected
within
the
Marsh

compared
to
the
open
Inlet
during
the
early
months
of

Oil

decreased
significantly
within
one

by
September
2010
whereas
oil
in
the
Inlet

increased
in

before
declining
in

The
greater
decrease
of
oil
in
Marsh
sediments
compared
to
the
Inlet
sediments
may
have
been
a
result
of
microbial
degradation
that
was
enhanced
by
the
plant

The
presence
of
marsh
vegetation
such
as
S.
alterniflora
40
and
J.
roemerianus
41
has
been
shown
to
decrease
oil
concentrations
in
sediments
possibly
due
to
plant
uptake
increased
aeration
in
the
root
zone
and/or
production
of
root
exudates
that
may
promote

Enzymes

that
may
have
been
important
in
hydrocarbon

Anaerobic

suggesting
that
the

biodegradation
of

could
have
occurred
within
the

Our
results
indicate
that
the
microbial
community
structure
and
function
of
the
coastal
salt
marsh
was
altered
during
the
months
of
oil
inundation
from
the
Deepwater
Horizon
oil
spill
The
amount
of
incoming
oil
its
heterogeneous
distribution
within
the
sediments
of
the
salt
marsh
warm
summer
temperatures
and
available
nutrients
may
have
played
key
roles
in
the
efficient
removal
of
oil
that
was
undetectable
within
five
months
based
on
our
samplings
The
significant
increase
in
response
to
the
oil
of
the
indigenous
microbial
population
containing
known
hydrocarbon-degrading
bacteria
coupled
with
a
subsequent
increase
in
hydrocarbon
degradation
functional
genes
provides
evidence
that
in
situ
bioremediation
contributed
to
the
degradation
of
oil
at
this
site
These
results
suggest
that
in
highly
sensitive
environments
such
as
salt
marshes
and
estuaries
that
support
a
naturally
occurring
hydrocarbon-degrading
microbial
population
natural
attenuation
may
be
a
preferable
means
of
remediation
to
other
mechanical
strategies
that
can
cause
irreparable
damage
to
the
habitat
However
further
comprehensive
microbial
studies
are
needed
in
Gulf
of
Mexico
areas
where
the
threat
of
oil
spills
is
an
ongoing
issue
in
order
to
establish
base-line
microbial
and
ecological
data
so
that
the
impacts
of
oil
spills
such
as
the
Deepwater
Horizon
may
be
fully
evaluated
in
the
future
The
research
site
used
in
the
present
study
has
a
history
of
oil
pollution
due
to
accidental
spills
and
previous
oil
spill
experiments
30
Therefore
an
oil-degrading
community
may
already
have
been
established
and
active
at
Stert
Flats
and
no
changes
in
community
structure
may
have
been
required
in
order
to
express
the
degradation
potential
It
is
also
possible
that
changes
in
community
structure
as
the
result
of
oil
pollution
and
bioremediation
treatment
were
too
small
to
be
detected
by
our
PCR-DGGE
approach
and
statistical
analysis
The
occurrence
of
significant
lasting
changes
in
bacterial
community
composition
in
plots
treated
with
slow-release
fertilizer
appears
to
contradict
the
idea
that
the
Stert
Flats
sediments
harbored
an
already
established
bacterial
community
in
the
oil-treated
plots
that
received
no
fertilizer
or
were
treated
with
liquid
fertilizer
since
one
might
expect
that
the
same
communities
would
be
responsible
for
hydrocarbon
degradation
in
the
plots
treated
with
slow-release
fertilizer
However
in
the
plots
treated
with
slow-release
fertilizer
the
nutrient
concentrations
were
greater
than
the
concentrations
in
the
other
plots
Degradation
of
beached
oil
is
in
general
limited
by
the
supply
of
N
and
P

28
The
observed
stimulation
of
oil
degradation
by
nutrient
amendment
in
this
study
as
well
as
in
previous
laboratory
experiments
21
indicates
that
this
is
also
the
case
for
our
field
site
Resource
ratio
theory
predicts
that
different
communities
are
selected
as
the
result
of
competition
for
limiting
resources
31
The
outcome
of
competition
is
determined
by
differences
in
species-specific
substrate
affinity
the
maximum
growth
rate
and
the
mortality
rate
Therefore
the
sustained
higher
nutrient
concentrations
present
in
the
plots
containing
slow-release
fertilizer
granules
may
have
resulted
in
selection
of
a
bacterial
community
that
differed
from
that
in
the
other
oil-treated
plots
It
is
unlikely
that
the
differences
in
community
structure
between
the
plots
treated
with
slow-release
fertilizer
and
the
other
plots
were
due
to
growth
of
bacteria
on
the
oleophilic
coating
of
the
slow-release
fertilizer
granules
The
slow-release
fertilizer
was
added
to
the
oil-treated
plots
in
mesh
bags
and
thus
was
physically
separated
from
the
oil-treated
sediment
that
was
sampled
for
analysis
Also
the
hulls
of
the
granules
remained
in
the
mesh
bags
after
the
nutrients
had
been
lost
from
the
granules
Furthermore
a
population
of
bacteria
closely
related
to
A.
borkumensis
99.9
similarity
developed
quickly
in
the
plots
treated
with
slow-release
fertilizer
and
significant
carbon
dioxide
production
occurred
in
these
plots
but
the
type
strain
of
A.
borkumensis
DSM
11573
was
unable
to
grow
with
the
fertilizer
granules
as
a
sole
source
of
carbon
data
not
shown
The
statistical
analysis
performed
in
our
study
showed
that
there
were
clear
differences
in
bacterial
community
structure
in
the
plots
treated
with
slow-release
fertilizer
both
in
time
and
between
different
blocks
Sometimes
even
within
plots
significant
variation
was
observed
The
reasons
for
these
differences
are
not
understood
since
the
plots
were
treated
with
the
same
amount
of
slow-release
fertilizer
However
they
may
be
related
to
heterogeneity
in
the
beach
sediments
similar
observations
were
made
in
a
randomized
block
bioremediation
experiment
on
the
shoreline
of
Delaware
17
although
in
that
study
community
patterns
were
not
analyzed
in
a
rigorous
statistical
manner
Also
the
addition
of
the
slow-release
fertilizer
to
the
plots
in
single
mesh
bags
may
have
resulted
in
an
uneven
release
of
nutrients
and
a
heterogeneous
distribution
in
the
oil-contaminated
beach
sediment
This
factor
probably
contributed
to
heterogeneity
in
bacterial
communities
between
blocks
and
within
plots
However
in
replicate
microcosms
containing
homogenized
Stert
Flat
beach
sediment
and
treated
with
the
same
amount
of
liquid
fertilizer
clear
variation
in
community
structure
was
observed
21
Therefore
besides
heterogeneity
in
nutrient
levels
and
sediment
other
unknown
factors
may
have
contributed
to
heterogeneity
in
bacterial
communities
in
plots
treated
with
slow-release
fertilizer
Our
results
clearly
indicate
that
it
may
not
be
sufficient
to
sample
a
single
location
when
the
bacterial
community
structure
of
oil-contaminated
shorelines
is
studied
19
It
has
been
suggested
that
restoration
of
the
bacterial
community
structure
to
a
state
similar
to
that
present
prior
to
pollution
could
be
used
as
a
parameter
for
determination
of
the
ecological
end
point
of
bioremediation
26
For
this
study
such
a
measure
may
have
been
of
little
value
in
the
plot
treated
with
slow-release
fertilizer
in
block
1
the
bacterial
community
structure
after
315
days
was
comparable
to
the
prepollution
community
structure
while
considerable
amounts
of
oil
especially
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
remained
Also
the
community
structure
in
the
oil-treated
plots
that
received
no
fertilizer
or
were
treated
with
liquid
fertilizer
could
in
general
not
be
distinguished
from
that
in
non-oil-treated
plots
despite
the
presence
of
oil
and
the
occurrence
of
significant
oil
degradation
In
conclusion
the
randomized
block
experiment
showed
that
biodegradation
of
buried
oil
is
stimulated
by
addition
of
nutrients
either
in
a
liquid
form
or
in
a
solid
form
The
relationship
between
community
structure
and
degradation
appears
to
be
complex
since
communities
with
similar
structures
showed
different
rates
of
degradation
while
communities
with
different
structures
showed
similar
degrees
of
degradation

A
field-scale
experiment
with
a
complete
randomized
block
design
was
performed
to
study
the
degradation
of
buried
oil
on
a
shoreline
over
a
period
of
almost
1
year
The
following
four
treatments
were
examined
in
three
replicate
blocks
two
levels
of
fertilizer
treatment
of
oil-treated
plots
one
receiving
a
weekly
application
of
liquid
fertilizer
and
the
other
treated
with
a
slow-release
fertilizer
and
two
controls
one
not
treated
with
oil
and
the
other
treated
with
oil
but
not
with
fertilizer
Oil
degradation
was
monitored
by
measuring
carbon
dioxide
evolution
and
by
chemical
analysis
of
the
oil
Buried
oil
was
degraded
to
a
significantly
greater
extent
in
fertilized
plots
but
no
differences
in
oil
chemistry
were
observed
between
the
two
different
fertilizer
treatments
although
carbon
dioxide
production
was
significantly
higher
in
the
oil-treated
plots
that
were
treated
with
slow-release
fertilizer
during
the
first
14
days
of
the
experiment
Bacterial
communities
present
in
the
beach
sediments
were
profiled
by
denaturing
gradient

electrophoresis
DGGE
analysis
of
PCR-amplified
16S
rRNA
gene
fragments
and
16S

amplified
by

PCR
Similarities
between
the
DGGE
profiles
were
calculated
and
similarity
matrices
were
subjected
to
statistical
analysis
These
analyses
showed
that
although
significant
hydrocarbon
degradation
occurred
both
in
plots
treated
with
oil
alone
and
in
the
plots
treated
with
oil
and
liquid
fertilizer
the
bacterial
community
structure
in
these
plots
was
in
general
not
significantly
different
from
that
in
the
control
plots
that
were
not
treated
with
oil
and
did
not
change
over
time
In
contrast
the
bacterial
community
structure
in
the
plots
treated
with
oil
and
slow-release
fertilizer
changed
rapidly
and
there
were
significant
differences
over
time
as
well
as
between
blocks
and
even
within
plots
The
differences
were
probably
related
to
the
higher
concentrations
of
nutrients
measured
in
interstitial
water
from
the
plots
treated
with
slow-release

Field
data
were
compared
to
the
results
of
previous
laboratory
microcosm
experiments
which
revealed
significant
differences
The
ability
to
degrade
hydrocarbon
components
of
crude
oil
is
widespread
among
marine
bacteria
10
and
bioremediation
has
proven
to
be
an
effective
method
for
cleaning
up
residual
oil
in
a
variety
of
coastal
environments
such
as
rocky
shorelines
6
and
pebble
29
and
coarse
sand
33
beaches
Due
to
the
high
carbon
content
of
oil
and
the
low
levels
of
other
nutrients
essential
for
microbial
growth
treatment
of
beached
oil
with
phosphorus
and
nitrogen
is
generally
required
to
enhance
the
growth
of
hydrocarbon-degrading
bacteria
and
to
stimulate
oil
degradation

Most
oil

have
focused
on
surface
contamination
of
relatively
coarse
shoreline
sediments
6
28
29
33
and
much
less
attention
has
been
paid
to
fine
sediments
such
as
those
found
in
the
upper
reaches
of
mudflats
around
the
coast
of
the
United
Kingdom
Oil
deposited
on
these
beaches
is
readily
buried
under
clean
sediment
by
tidal
action
and
is
therefore
difficult
to
clean
by
conventional
methods
Suitable
nutrient
amendment
levels
required
for
optimal
hydrocarbon
biodegradation
are
often
determined
by
laboratory
incubations
Laboratory
microcosm
studies
performed
with
sediment
collected
from
a
beach
used
in
the
present
field
study
demonstrated
that
a
wide
range
of
nutrient
additions
selected
for
different
bacterial
communities
but
oil
was
degraded
to
similar
extents
irrespective
of
the
structure
of
the
predominant
bacterial
communities
present
21
However
laboratory
incubations
do
not
necessarily
accurately
reflect
field
conditions
and
field
trials
must
be
conducted
to
corroborate
findings
of
laboratory
experiments
28
In
experiments
to
assess
hydrocarbon
degradation
on
contaminated
shorelines
careful
attention
must
be
paid
to
experimental
design
33
Unknown
and
uncontrollable
factors
like
longshore
currents
spatially
distinct
underground
flows
and
winds
may
have
different
effects
on
different
parts
of
the
same
experimental
area
These
effects
can
be
accounted
for
by
using
a
completely
randomized
block
design
in
which
treatments
are
replicated
and
randomly
assigned
to
replicate
blocks
A
completely
randomized
block

allows
assignment
of
statistically
significant
differences
to
treatments
In
recent
years
such
a
design
has
been
used
to
determine
the
effects
of
bioremediation

Microbial

in
detail
in
only
one

in
which
a
completely

was
used
17
However
in
that
study
samples
from
the
early

of
the

were
not

and
the

were

In

in
our
understanding
of
the

The
fine
sand
is
highly
mobile
and
moves
between
7
and
13
cm
during
a

The
site
has
a

The
beach
has
a
shallow

and
is
generally
subjected
to

The
amount
of
time
that
the
experimental
plots
were
covered
by
the
tide
depended
on
the
height
of
the
tide
and
the
lunar
cycle
however
observations
made
during
the
experiment
showed
that
the
minimum
coverage

was
approximately
1
h
for
each
tidal

addition
alone
and

appeared
to
have

might
have

These

could
have
been
obscured
by
the
DGGE
approach
in
which
rRNA

The

were
screened
by

which
revealed
that
five

occurred
more
than

DGGE
analysis
of
representatives
of
these
five
ARDRA

showed
that
two
of
these
representatives
comigrated
with
bands
a
and

in

These
ARDRA
types
represented
12.5
and
37.5
of
the
clones
in
the
library
respectively
Sequencing
of
the
cloned
nearly
complete

indicated
that
the
ARDRA

that
comigrated
with

was
very
similar
to

identical

DISCUSSION
In
this
study
by
using
a
randomized
block
design
we
demonstrated
that
buried
oil
was
degraded
significantly
in
the
field
during
the
first
3
months
of
the
experiment
when
plots
were
fertilized
with
nutrients
When
fertilizer
treatment
was
stopped
the
extent
of
oil
degradation
percent
removed
in
unfertilized
plots
equaled
the
extent
of
degradation
in
the
fertilizer-treated
plots
However
the
time
that
it
took
to
achieve
the
same
level
of
hydrocarbon
degradation
was
longer
in
plots
that
did
not
receive
fertilizer
treatment
The
type
of
treatment
did
not
influence
the
oil
components
that
were
degraded
Although
during
the
first
2
weeks
significant
differences
were
observed
between
blocks
as
determined
from
carbon
dioxide
production
differences
were
not
evident
from
oil
chemistry
measurements
after
3
months
Interestingly
however
the
absolute
amount
of
oil
was
smaller
with
both
fertilizer
treatments
25
The
results
of
this
study
of
bioremediation
of
buried
oil
are
consistent
with
the
results
of
two
previous
experiments
in
which
a
randomized
block
design
was
used
which
showed
that
bioremediation
treatment
significantly
enhanced
oil
degradation
on
surface-contaminated
shorelines
29
33
To
the
best
of
our
knowledge
our
study
uniquely
integrated
a
robust
randomized
block
design
with
a
comprehensive
statistical
analysis
of
bacterial
community
dynamics
In
addition
higher-resolution
molecular
analysis
demonstrated
the
importance
of
and
rapid
proliferation
of
the
oil-degrading
organism
Alcanivorax
in
oil
spill
bioremediation
under
field
conditions
suggesting
that
Alcanivorax
spp
are
key
for
dissipation
of
hydrocarbon
pollution
on
maritime
beaches
Previous
laboratory
experiments
performed
with
beach
sediment
from
the
site
of
the
field
experiment
reported
here
Stert
Flats
United
Kingdom
had
shown
that
addition
of
nutrients
strongly
stimulated
oil
degradation
in
this
beach
sediment
21
However
a
comparison
of
the
characteristics
of
oil
degradation
revealed
differences
between
the
laboratory
and
field
experiments
Degradation
in
nutrient-amended
laboratory
experiments
was
faster
and
n-alkanes
were
depleted
within
1
month
Also
the
extent
of
oil
degradation
was
greater
in
the
laboratory
experiments
In
laboratory
microcosms
phenanthrenes
and
dibenzothiophenes
were
degraded
but
this
was
not
observed
in
the
field
experiment
Large
changes
in
community
structure
occurred
in
the
laboratory
experiments
in
which
the
preparations
were
amended
with
liquid
fertilizer
while
addition
of
liquid
fertilizer
had
only
some
short-term
effects
on
community
structure
in
the
field
The
differences
probably
are
related
to
differences
in
the
experimental
conditions
in
the
laboratory
and
field
studies
In
the
laboratory
experiment
a
temperature
of
20°C
was
maintained
Although
tidal
cycles
were
simulated
in
the
laboratory
experiment
the
amount
of
water
added
to
the
microcosm
per
cycle
1
liter
per
microcosm
containing
1.3
kg
of
sediment
was
relatively
small
compared
to
the
field
situation
and
this
was
probably
the
cause
of
the
relatively
high
residual
concentrations
of
nutrients
that
were
maintained
in
the
microcosms
despite
the
use
of
water-soluble
fertilizer
In
the
field
experiment
the
nitrogen
concentrations
in
the
plots
treated
with
liquid
fertilizer
were
in
general
not
significantly
different
from
those
in
the
unfertilized
oil-treated
plots
and
this
may
well
explain
the
minor
differences
in
bacterial
communities
noted
in
the
majority
of
these
plots
Nutrient
levels
are
an
important
factor
in
structuring
microbial
communities
as
discussed
below
The
obvious
differences
between
the
field
and
laboratory
experiments
indicate
that
great
care
should
be
taken
when
results
of
laboratory
experiments
are
extrapolated
to
field
situations
and
they
underline
the
need
to
support
results
obtained
in
the
laboratory
with
field
experiments
27
Nevertheless
some
similarities
between
field
and
laboratory
experiments
were
observed
With
the
slow-release
fertilizer
treatment
significantly
higher
nutrient
concentrations
were
maintained
in
the
pore
water
similar
to
the
high
nutrient
concentrations
maintained
in
the
laboratory
experiments
with
liquid
fertilizer
21
In
both
cases
a
sustained
change
in
bacterial
community
structure
occurred
Furthermore
in
both
field
and
laboratory
experiments
selection
for
Alcanivorax-like
bacteria
was
noted
A.
borkumensis
is
capable
of
using
only
a
few
organic
substrates
especially
alkanes
36
and
the
alkyl
groups
of
n-alkylbenzenes
and
n-alkylcycloalkanes
7
Alkanes
are
among
the
most
easily
degradable
oil
components
2
Our
observation
is
the
second
observation
that
these
bacteria
are
important
components
of
an
oil-degrading
community
in
the
field
indicating
their
significance
in
hydrocarbon
degradation
Previously
the
presence
of
Alcanivorax
was
noted
in
beach
oil
paste
and
seawater
after
an
oil
spill
in
the
Japan
Sea
14
Clear
selection
for
P.

was
also
observed

20
Interestingly
16S
rRNA
gene
sequences
related
to
P.
stutzeri
were
not
detected
in
laboratory
experiments
in
which
sediments
from
the
same
beach
used
in
this
field
study
were
used
515
clones
were
screened
21
Significantly
greater
hydrocarbon
degradation
during
the
first
80
days
of
the
experiment
occurred
in
the
oil-treated
plots
treated
with
fertilizer
than
in
the
oil-treated
plots
that
received
no
fertilizer
However
the
oil-treated
plots
that
received
no
fertilizer
did
show
significant
degradation
over
time
Remarkably
only
a
few
very-short-lived
significant
differences
in
bacterial
community
structure
were
observed
between
the
oil-treated
plots
that
received
no
fertilizer
and
the
oil-treated
plots
treated
with
liquid
fertilizer
while
no
significant
differences
were
observed
between
the
oil-treated
plots
that
received
no
fertilizer
and
the
non-oil-treated
control
plots
Interestingly
in
laboratory
experiments
Wikström

noted
changes
in
the
microbial
community
of
groundwater
contaminated
with
nitroaromatic
compounds
following
amendment
with
hydrocarbons
to
which
the
microbial
community
had
not
been
previously
exposed
but
not
after

with
excessive
amounts
of
hydrocarbons
to
which
the
microbial

had
been
exposed
previously
Naturally
occurring
microbial
consortia
have
been
utilized
in
a
variety
of
bioremediation
processes
Recent
developments
in
molecular
microbial
ecology
offer
new
tools
that
facilitate
molecular
analyses
of
microbial
populations
at
contaminated
and
bioremediated
sites
Information
provided
by
such
analyses
aids
in
the
evaluation
of
the
effectiveness
of
bioremediation
and
the
formulation
of
strategies
that
might
accelerate
bioremediation
Bioremediation
is
a
technology
that
utilizes
the
metabolic
potential
of
microorganisms
to
clean
up
contaminated
environments
One
important
characteristic
of
bioremediation
is
that
it
is
carried
out
in
non-sterile
open
environments
that
contain
a
variety
of
organisms
Of
these
bacteria
such
as
those
capable
of
degrading
pollutants
usually
have
central
roles
in
bioremediation
whereas
other
organisms
e.g
fungi
and
grazing
protozoa
also
affect
the
process
A
deeper
understanding
of
the
microbial
ecology
of
contaminated
sites
is
therefore
necessary
to
further
improve
bioremediation
processes
In
the
past
two
decades
molecular
tools
exemplified
by
rRNA
approaches
have
been
introduced
into
microbial
ecology
these
tools
have
facilitated
the
analysis
of
natural
microbial
populations
without
cultivation
Microbiologists
have
now
realized
that
natural
microbial
populations
are
much
more
diverse
than
those
expected
from
the
catalog
of
isolated
microorganisms
This
is
also
the
case
for
pollutant-degrading
microorganisms
implying
that
the
natural
environment
harbors
a
wide
range
of
unidentified
pollutant-degrading
microorganisms
that
have
crucial
roles
in
bioremediation
This
article
summarizes
the
results
of
recent
studies
of
microbial
populations
that
are
relevant
to
bioremediation
Molecular
ecological
information
is
thought
to
be
useful
for
the
development
of
strategies
to
improve
bioremediation
and
for
evaluating
its
consequences
including
risk
assessment
Molecular
tools
are
especially
useful
in
bioaugmentation
in
which
exogenous
microorganisms
that
are
introduced
to
accelerate
pollutant
biodegradation
need
to
be
monitored
This
article
discusses
recent
examples
of
the
successful
application
of
molecular
ecological
tools
to
the
study
of
bioremediation
Microorganisms
relevant
to
methane
oxidation
Traditionally
studies
on
pollutant
biodegradation
have
been
initiated
by
the
isolation
of
one
or
more
microorganisms
capable
of
degrading
target
pollutants
however
conventional
isolation
methods
have
resulted
in
the
isolation
of
only
a
fraction
of
the
diverse
pollutant-degrading
microorganisms
in
the
environment
In
addition
most
isolated
organisms
have
shown
pollutant-degradation
kinetics
that
differ
from
those
observed
in
the
environment
1
For
example
laboratory-cultivated
methanotrophs
exhibit
half-saturation
constants
for
methane
oxidation
which
are
one
to
three
orders
of
magnitude
higher
than
those
observed
in
soil
Using
molecular
phylogenetic
analyses
of
isotope-labeled
DNA
Radajewski
et
al
2••
successfully
identified
two
novel
methanotrophs
that
actively
degrade
methane
under
environmental
conditions
Molecular
approaches
that
target
the
16S
rRNA
gene
16S
rDNA
and
genes
encoding
enzymes
involved
in
key
metabolic
steps
e.g
those
encoding
particulate
methane
mono-oxygenase
have
been
applied
to
the
analysis
of
methanotrophs
in
rice
field
soil
3
lake
sediments
4
and
forest
soil
5
Methanotrophs
are
considered
to
be
important
for
reducing
the
emission
of
methane
a
greenhouse
gas
from
soil
and
sediment
In
addition
methanotrophs
co-metabolize
trichloroethylene
TCE
therefore
TCE
bioremediation
often
employs
methane
injection
as
a
means
to
stimulate
the
TCE-degrading
activity
of
indigenous
methanotrophs
i.e
methane
biostimulation
Methanotrophs
which
occurred
at
a
methane
biostimulation
site
were
recently
analyzed
using
denaturing
gradient
gel
electrophoresis
DGGE
of
polymerase
chain
reaction

Marine
petroleum
hydrocarbon
degradation
Molecular
ecological
approaches
have
also
been
used
to
analyze
bacterial
populations
that
occur
in
petroleum-contaminated
marine
environments
Spilled-oil
bioremediation
experiments
conducted
at
a
sandy
beach
found
that
phylotypes
affiliated
with
the
α
subclass
of
Proteobacteria
α-Proteobacteria
appeared
in
the
DGGE
fingerprints
obtained
for
oiled
plots
but
not
in
those
for
unoiled

suggesting
their
importance
in
spilled-oil
bioremediation
Another
oil-spill
experiment
conducted
at
a
beach
in
the
Norwegian
Arctic
showed
that
16S
rDNA
types
affiliated
with
the
γ-Proteobacteria
especially
those
belonging
to
the
Pseudomonas
and
Cycloclasticus
groups
were
abundant
in
fertilized
oil

Microbial
populations
which
occurred
in
seawater
after
supplementation
with
petroleum
and
inorganic
fertilizers
have
been
analyzed
using
rRNA
approaches
it
was
reported
that
bacterial

showed
accelerated
growth
These
studies
have
indicated
that
some
groups
of
bacteria
commonly
occur
in
oil-contaminated
marine
environments
although
other
populations
change
under
different
environmental
conditions
Anaerobic
petroleum
hydrocarbon
degradation
As
petroleum
hydrocarbons
are
persistent
under
anaerobic
conditions
their
contamination
of
groundwater
is
a
serious
environmental
problem
The
microbial
diversity
in
a
hydrocarbon-
and
chlorinated-solvent
contaminated
aquifer
undergoing
intrinsic
bioremediation
was
assessed
by
cloning
and
sequencing
bacterial
and
archaeal
16S
rDNA
fragments
11
This
study
detected
phylotypes
that
were
closely
related
to
Syntrophus
spp
anaerobic
oxidizers
of
organic
acids
with
the
production
of
acetate
and
hydrogen
and
Methanosaeta
spp
aceticlastic
methanogens
suggesting
their
syntrophic
association
Phylotypes
affiliated
with
candidate
divisions
that
do
not
contain
any
isolated
organisms
were
also
obtained
in
abundance
from
the
contaminated
aquifer
11
although
their
physiology
is
completely
unknown
A
similar
syntrophic
association
of
bacteria
and
archaea
has
also
been
reported
in
a
methanogenic
enrichment
that
slowly
degrades
hexadecane
12
Likewise
a
toluene-degrading
methanogenic
consortium
was
characterized
by
rRNA
approaches
13
The
consortium
comprised
two
archaeal
species
related
to
the
genera
Methanosaeta
and
Methanospirillum
and
two
bacterial
species
one
related
to
the
genus
Desulfotomaculum

the
other
unrelated
to
any
previously
described
genus
Fluorescence
in

hybridization
FISH
with

a
denitrifying
microbial
community
degrading
alkylbenzenes
and
n-alkanes
14
the
Azoarcus/Thauera
group
was
found
to
be
the
major
bacterial
group
Bacteria
affiliated
with
the
ε-Proteobacteria
were
found
to
grow
in
petroleum-contaminated
groundwater
which
accumulated
at
the
bottom
of
underground
crude-oil
storage
cavities
15
Microbial
communities
associated
with
anaerobic
benzene
degradation

-reducing
conditions
in
a
petroleum-contaminated
subsurface
aquifer
were
also
analyzed
by
DGGE
analysis
16
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
Fe
III
-reducing
Geobacter
spp
have
an
important
role
in
the
anaerobic
oxidation
of
benzene
The
available
electron
acceptors
are
the
principal
determinants
for
the
types
of
microorganisms
that
occur
in
anaerobic
environments
and
microbial
populations
identified
in
the
above
papers
are
considered
important
for
petroleum
hydrocarbon
degradation
in
subsurface
environments
under
the
respective
conditions
On
the
basis
of
these
results
future
developments
in
anaerobic
hydrocarbon
bioremediation
are
anticipated
17
It
is
noteworthy
that
phylotypes
that
are
only
distantly
related
to
known
genera
are
often
detected
as
major
members
of
the
anaerobic
communities
suggesting
that
parts
of
anaerobic
hydrocarbon
biodegradation
processes
remain
unidentified
Polycyclic

A
soil-derived

analyzed
by
DGGE

19
The
analysis
detected

e.g
Burkholderias
Sphingomonas
and
Mycobacterium
although
the
degradation
mechanisms
have
yet
to
be
resolved
In
soil
environments
the
reduced
bioavailability
of
PAHs
due
to
sorption
to
natural
organic
matter
is
an
important
factor
controlling
their
biodegradation
20
Friedrich
et
al
reported
that
different
phenanthrene-degrading
bacteria
occurred
in
soil
enrichments
when
different
sorptive
matrices
were
present
21•
It
has
also
been
shown
that
the
application
of
surfactants
to
soil
enrichments
that
degrade
phenanthrene
and
hexadecane
altered
the
microbial
populations
responsible
for
the
degradation
22
These
results
have
common
implications
for
bioremediation
that
is
nature
harbors
diverse
microbial
populations
capable
of
pollutant
degradation
from
which
a
few

populations
are
selected
according
to
bioremediation
strategies
Metal

Because
of

soil

for
many
years

heavy
metals
were
assessed
using
rRNA
approaches
including
FISH
and
cloning
and
sequencing
23
The
study
found
that
two
sequence
groups
affiliated
with
the
α-Proteobacteria
and
Actinobacteria
were
frequently
obtained
from
clone
libraries
from
the
metal-contaminated
soil

most
Actinobacteria
sequences
showed
low
similarity
85
to
the
sequences
of
any
hitherto
cultured
actinomycete
The
detoxification
machineries
that
some
of
these
organisms
may
have
are
considered
useful
for
metal
bioremediation
and
comparisons
with
the
machineries
of
previously
isolated
metal-resistant
bacteria
may
yield
interesting
results

Conclusions
Bioremediation
is
still
considered
to
be
a
developing
technology
One
difficulty
is
that
bioremediation
is
carried
out
in
the
natural
environment
which
contains
diverse
uncharacterized
organisms
Most
pollutant-degrading
microorganisms
isolated
and
characterized
in
the
laboratory
are
now
thought
to
make
a
minor
contribution
to
bioremediation
Another
difficulty
is
that
no
two
environmental
problems
occur
under
completely
identical
conditions
for
example
variations
occur
in
the
types
and
amounts
of
pollutants
climate
conditions
and
hydrogeodynamics
These
difficulties
have
caused
the
bioremediation
field
to
lag
behind
knowledge-based
technologies
that
are
governed
by
common
rationales
As
summarized
in
this
review
information
on
microbial
populations
relevant
to
bioremediation
is
accumulating
rapidly
with
the
aid
of
molecular
ecological
approaches
Although
our
knowledge
is
not
yet
complete
it
is
time
to
initiate
more
comprehensive
approaches
to
find
common
rationales
in
bioremediation
In
some
cases
for
example
marine
petroleum
bioremediation
we
have
already
found
that
similar
bacterial
populations
occur
even
at
geographically
distant
sites
Understanding
the
physiology
and
genetics
of
such
populations
may
prove
very
useful
to
assess
and
improve
bioremediation
Most
importantly
we
need
to
identify
general
aspects
in
certain
types
of
bioremediation
For
this
purpose
I
wish
to
propose
the
construction
of
a
database
that
collects
the
results
of
molecular
ecological
assessments
of
contaminated
and
bioremediated
sites
The
database
would
provide
bioremediation
with
ecological
backgrounds
and
in
concert
with
currently
available
databases
relevant
to
bioremediation
would
facilitate
the
development
of
commonly
applicable
schemes
for
certain
types
of
bioremediation
Although
in
the
contaminated
microcosms
without
nutrient
treatment
0
N
no
significant
oil
degradation
occurred
over
the
28-day
incubation
period
remarkably
the
bacterial
communities
changed
considerably
and
the
predominance
of
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter-like
sequences
in
the
corresponding
clone
library
was
apparent
This
may
be
explained
by
the
release
of
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
from
biomass
killed
by
the
oil
supporting
limited
hydrocarbon
degradation
Interestingly
hydrocarbon
pollutants
can
induce
prophages
resulting
in
lysis
of
a
large
proportion
of
the
bacterial
community
9
23
and
this
may
explain
changes
in
community
composition
independent
of
extensive
oil
degradation
Even
in
the
absence
of
significant
hydrocarbon
degradation
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter-like
sequences
constituted
about
40
of
the
clone
libraries
constructed
from
samples
taken
at
days
6
and
26
from
the
unamended
oil-contaminated
control
microcosm
To
assess
if
this
is
a
consequence
of
relatively
very
low
rates
of
hydrocarbon
degradation
by
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter-like
bacteria
under
these
conditions
information
on
their
activity
would
be
required
for
example
measurement
of
mRNA
that
encodes
enzymes
involved
in
biodegradation
The
members
of
the
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter
group
appear
to
have
a
cosmopolitan
distribution
as
their
presence
has
been
noted
in
coastal
waters
and
on

The

Alcanivorax
spp
indicates
that
they
may
be
of
considerable
global
significance
in
marine
hydrocarbon
degradation
and
a
project
to

of
this
important

Degradation
of
oil
on
beaches
is
in
general
limited
by
the
supply
of
inorganic
nutrients
In

to
obtain
a
more
systematic
understanding
of
the
effects
of

addition
on

bioremediation
beach
sediment
microcosms
contaminated
with
oil
were
treated
with
different
levels
of
inorganic
nutrients
Oil
biodegradation
was
assessed
respirometrically
and
on
the
basis
of
changes
in
oil
composition
Bacterial
communities
were
compared
by
numerical
analysis
of
denaturing
gradient
gel

DGGE
profiles
of
PCR-amplified
16S

genes
and
cloning
and

Nutrient
amendment
over
a
wide
range
of
concentrations
significantly
improved
oil
degradation
confirming
that
N
and
P
limited
degradation
over
the
concentration
range
tested
However
the
extent
and
rate
of
oil
degradation
were
similar
for
all
microcosms
indicating
that
in
this
experiment
it
was
the
addition
of
inorganic
nutrients
rather
than
the
precise
amount
that
was
most
important
operationally
Very
different
microbial
communities
were
selected
in
all
of
the
microcosms
Similarities
between
DGGE
profiles
of
replicate
samples
from
a
single
microcosm
were
high
95
±
5
but
similarities
between
DGGE
profiles
from
replicate
microcosms
receiving
the
same
level
of
inorganic
nutrients
68
±
5
were
not
significantly
higher
than
those
between
microcosms
subjected
to
different
nutrient
amendments
63
±
7
Therefore
it
is
apparent
that
the
different
communities
selected
can
not
be
attributed
to
the
level
of
inorganic
nutrients
present
in
different
microcosms
Bioremediation
treatments
dramatically
reduced
the
diversity
of
the
bacterial
community
The
decrease
in
diversity
could
be
accounted
for
by
a
strong
selection
for
bacteria
belonging
to
the
alkane-degrading
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter
group
On
the
basis
of
Shannon-Weaver
indices
rapid
recovery
of
the
bacterial
community
diversity
to
preoiling
levels
of
diversity
occurred
However
although
the
overall
diversity
was
similar
there
were
considerable
qualitative
differences
in
the
community
structure
before
and
after
the
bioremediation
treatments
Although
accidental
releases
account
for
only
a
small
percentage
of
the
oil
released
into
the
marine
environment
large
oil
spills
attract
much
public
attention
and
cause
environmental
concern
Spill
incidents
have
prompted
research
on
cost-effective
environmentally
benign
cleanup
strategies
Physical
and
on
rare
occasions
chemical
methods
are
capable
of
rapidly
removing
the
majority
of
beached
oil
but
they
are
rarely
completely
successful
33
Natural
degradative
processes
aid
in
removing
the
remaining
oil
Bacteria
are
considered
to
represent
the
predominant
agents
of
hydrocarbon
degradation
in
the
environment
27
and
hydrocarbon-degrading
bacteria
are
ubiquitous
More
than
20
genera
of
marine
hydrocarbon-degrading
bacteria
distributed
over
several
sub
phyla
α-
β-
and
γ-proteobacteria

positives

As
a
single
species
typically
is
capable
of
degrading
only
a
limited
number
of
the
compounds
found
in
crude
oil
a
consortium
composed
of
many
different
bacterial
species
is
usually
involved
in
oil
degradation
Because
of
the
high
carbon
content
of
oil
and
the
low
level
of
other
nutrients
essential
for
microbial
growth
the
rate
and
extent
of
degradation
are
in
general
limited
by
the
low
availability
of
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
2
33
Consequently
growth
of
hydrocarbon-degrading
bacteria
and
hydrocarbon
degradation
can
be
strongly
enhanced
by
fertilization
with
inorganic
N
and
P.
This
has
proven
an
effective
bioremediation
treatment
on
several
types
of
shorelines

Bioremediation
studies
have
in
general
been
dominated
by
an
empirical
approach
and
optimum
nutrient
amendment
levels
are
often
informed
by
laboratory
incubations
In
the
field
care
must
be
taken
in
supplying
optimum
concentrations
of
inorganic
nutrients
Too
high
concentrations
may
result
in
eutrophication
and
too
low
concentrations
may
result
in
suboptimal
biodegradation
A
better
understanding
of
the
systematic
effects
of
nutrient
amendment
on
biodegradative
microbial
populations
and
the
progress
of
bioremediation
would
assist
the
development
of
more
rational
bioremediation
strategies

Therefore
laboratory
beach
microcosm
experiments
were
performed
to
determine
the
effects
of
different
levels
of
N
and
P

on
oil
degradation
and
bacterial

sediment
was
collected
from
this

Sediment
was
transported
to
the

at
ambient

10°C
and
used
for
microcosm

within
1
day
of

The
sediment
was
a
fine

80
of
the

The
average

The

at
the

On
the
basis
of
this
slope
and
tide
information
a
tidal
regimen
for
the
laboratory
microcosms
was
set
at
a

of

of
1.6

a
submergence
of
the

in
every

Fresh

To
allow
equilibration
of
physical

chemical
parameters
the
microcosms
were
subjected
to
six
tidal

before
the

was
mixed
vigorously
with

to
form
a
stable
water-in-oil

The

was
added
to
the

of
3.7
kg/m2
by
pouring
it

added
24

after
oil
addition
and
also
after
7
14
and
21
days
Each
nutrient
addition
50
ml

was
calculated
to

The
stability
of
the

The

were
selected

DGGE
analysis
revealed

range
of

with
none
dominating
the
clone
libraries
Table

and
Fig

Almost
half
of
the
clones
were
unique
meaning
that
their
ARDRA
type
was
only
encountered
once
in
a
clone
library
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
not
to
catalogue
the
wider
diversity
of
the
bacterial
populations
present
in
the
beach
sediments
and
these
were
not
analyzed
further
The
high
diversity
was
also
indicated
by
the
fact
that
of
the
49
clones
sequenced
clones
with
similar
ARDRA
profiles
and

were
encountered
only
twice

In

resulted
in
strong
dominance
by
a
few
ARDRA/sequence
types

This
decrease
in
diversity
was
also
illustrated
by
the
calculation
of
the
Shannon-Weaver
index
for
the

The

was
observed

significantly
improved

thus
showing
as
expected
21
that
oil
degradation
was
limited
by
the
supply
of
N
and
P.
Upon
repeated
fertilization
a
temporary
increase
in
carbon

evolution
was
observed
indicating
that
at
these

N

were
still

in
the
oil-contaminated
nutrient-amended

Bragg
et

noted
a
positive
relationship
between
the
rate
of
oil
biodegradation
and
nitrogen
concentration
in
beach
sediment
pore
water
demonstrating
that
the
pore
water
nutrient
content
was
the
most
significant
factor
controlling
the
rate
of
oil
degradation
Our
results
concur
with
this
only
partly
Nutrient
addition
did
significantly
increase
the
oil
biodegradation
rate
However
even
though
the
various
nutrient
amendments
resulted
in
different
nutrient
levels
in
the
microcosms
and
initially
carbon
dioxide
production
rates
correlated
with
the
amount
of
added
inorganic
nutrients
over
the
full
period
of
the
experiment
the
rates
and
extent
of
oil
degradation
were
comparable
Experiments
conducted
with
lower
oil
concentrations
also
demonstrated
that
above
a
particular
level
of
nutrient
addition
nutrient
levels
did
not
further
enhance
oil
biodegradation
3
Furthermore
Lee
et
al
29
obtained
similar
results
and
showed
no
significant
difference
in
oil
degradation
in
a
field
experiment
using
low
and
high
concentrations
of
fertilizers
although
degradation
was
higher
than
in
oiled
unamended
plots
Reasons
for
these
differences
are
unknown
but
may
relate
to
differences
in
the
geology
of
the
beach
and
therefore
different
retention
characteristics
of
the
inorganic
nutrients
within
the
sediment
Bragg
et

studied

a
cobble
beach
while
the
study
by
Lee
et
al
28
and
our
study
were
performed
on
sandy
beach
material
Nevertheless
the
results
indicate
that
bioremediation
should
be
effective
despite
the
usual
patchy
oil
deposition
on
a
heterogeneous
beach
after
a
spill
and
similarly
uneven
distribution
of
inorganic
nutrients
supplied
during
bioremediation
N
and
P
were
supplied
at
different
concentrations
which
according
to
resource
ratio
theory
44
should
select
different
microbial
communities
dominated
by
the
organisms
most
capable
of
utilizing
the
inorganic
nutrients
at
the
levels
added
to
the
polluted
habitat
In
principle
this
could
offer
opportunities
to
direct
oil
degradation
21

Clear-cut
differences
in
bacterial
community
structure
were
found
in
microcosms
treated
with
different
levels
of
inorganic
nutrients
which
appears
consistent
with
the
predictions
of
resource
ratio
theory
However
statistical
analysis
of
DGGE
profiles
revealed
that
the
average
similarities
between
DGGE
profiles
from
three
independently
prepared
microcosms
receiving
the

N
were
not
significantly
different
from
the
similarities
between
microcosms
subjected
to
different
nutrient
amendments
Therefore
it
can
not
be
concluded
that
the
different
communities
selected
resulted
from
differences
in
nutrient
amendment
alone
It
is
unlikely
that
heterogeneity
within
the
microcosms
as
the
result
of
stratification
or
poor
mixing
of
oil
and
sediment/water
contributed

between
days
6
and

after
major
changes

were
similar

Nevertheless
the
results
revealed
that

to

showed
similar
rates
and

of

degradation
at
different
nutrient
concentrations
This
observation
may
be
due
largely
to
the
strong
selection
for
a
few
members
of
the
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter
group
which
are

observations
have
been
made
for
a

This
reactor
revealed
considerable

Bioremediation
treatments
are
aimed
at
stimulating
pollutant-degrading
microorganisms
to
speed
the
recovery
of
contaminated
ecosystem
to
a
prepollution
state
in

of

and
ecosystem

In
this
study
changes
in
the
predominant
bacterial
populations
occurred
in
all
of
the
microcosms
except
that
which
received
inorganic
nutrients
but
not
oil
Oiling
and
especially
bioremediation
led
to
a
strong
decrease
in
bacterial
community
diversity
at
day
6
but
a
rapid
recovery
to
near
preoiling
levels
of
diversity
occurred
subsequently
Still
despite
having
a
similar
level
of
biodiversity
the
component
organisms
contributing
to
that
diversity
were
somewhat
different
from
the
original
community
as
revealed
by
DGGE
analysis
and
clone
libraries
Following
bioremediation
α-proteobacteria
were
dominant
by
day
26
of
the
experiment
whereas
prior
to
oil
contamination
they
had
only
represented
8
of
the
clones
in
the
libraries
Sequences
from
α-proteobacteria
most
closely
related
to
Erythrobacter
spp
were
most
commonly
encountered
Erythrobacter
spp
belong
to
the
aerobic
anoxygenic
phototrophic
bacteria
49
They
metabolize
organic
substrates
with
light
enhancing
their
growth
Recently
it
was
revealed
that
aerobic
anoxygenic
phototrophic
bacteria
play
a
critical
role
in
the
carbon
cycle
in
the
ocean
26
Aerobic
anoxygenic
phototrophic
bacteria
grow
well
in
high-nutrient
media
and
are
often
isolated
from
environments
with
a
high
level
of
organic
matter
content
49
as
well
as
from
intertidal
beach
sediments
36
Recently
a
PAH-degrading
bacterium
most
closely
related
to
Erythrobacter
spp.
Lutibacterium
anuloederans
LC8
was
isolated
from

The

of
L.
anuloederans
shows
95.3
to
96.1
similarity
to
our
Erythrobacter-like
sequences
An
α-proteobacterial
sequence
related
to
Erythrobacter
spp
was
also
detected
in
beach
sediments
from
an
oil
spill

field
experiment
conducted
in
Delaware

Perhaps
the
most
dramatic
observation
made
in
the
present
study
was
the
rapid
and
strong
selection
for
γ-proteobacteria
in
oil-treated
microcosms
The
γ-proteobacteria
persisted
in
clone
libraries
from
sediment
samples
treated
with
oil
alone
taken
on
day
26
while
they
were
replaced
by
α-proteobacteria
in
microcosms
treated
with
oil
and
inorganic
nutrients
This
may
reflect
slow
ongoing
alkane
degradation
in
the
microcosms
not
treated
with
inorganic
nutrients
and
selection
of
organisms
growing
on
residual
PAH
and
secondary
products
of
hydrocarbon
degradation
in
the
bioremediated
microcosms
A
field
experiment
on
shoreline
sediments
in
the
Norwegian
Arctic
19
revealed
an
increase
in
γ-proteobacteria
in
oil-contaminated
beach
sediments
while
the
microbial
community
of
beached
oil
paste
after
the
Nakhodka
oil
spill
accident
in
the
Japan
Sea
was
also
dominated
by
γ-proteobacteria
25
These
results
are
consistent
with
our
observation
of
a
strong
dominance
by
γ-proteobacteria
and
this
may
be
a
characteristic
of
bacterial
communities
associated
with
recently
spilled
oil
In
our
case
it
was
mainly
members
of
the
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter
group
that
were
selected
Alcanivorax
borkumensis
48
and
Fundibacter
jadensis
5
were
described
recently
Both
are
capable
of
using
only
a
few
organic
substrates
especially
alkanes
5
48
and
the
alkyl
groups
of
n-alkylbenzenes
and
n-alkylcycloalkanes
11
Alkanes
are
major
oil
components
explaining
why
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter-like
sequences
made
a
significant
contribution
up
to
73
to
clone
libraries
early
in
the
bioremediation
process
and
for
a
longer
period
when
the
hydrocarbon
degradation
rate
was
lower
Because
of
biases
associated
with
PCR
and
cloning
47
these
clone
percentages
probably
do
not
directly
represent
Alcanivorax
cell
numbers
but
since
all
samples
were
analyzed
in
the
same
fashion
and
the
predominance
of
Alcanivorax-like
sequences
in
the
clone
libraries
was
so
dramatic
it
is
likely
that
our
results
do
reflect
a
genuine
increase
in
the
relative
abundance
of
this
group
of
bacteria
Furthermore
fluorescence
in
situ
hybridization
analyses
have
shown
that
Alcanivorax
constituted
more
than
90
of
the
entire
microbial
community
in
laboratory
incubations
of
seawater
supplemented
with

Degradation
of

respirometrically

Nutrient
amendment
over
a
wide
range
of
concentrations
significantly
improved
oil
degradation
confirming
that
N
and
P
limited
degradation
over
the
concentration
range
tested
However
the
extent
and
rate
of
oil
degradation
were
similar
for
all
microcosms
indicating
that
in
this
experiment
it
was
the
addition
of
inorganic
nutrients
rather
than
the
precise
amount
that
was
most
important
operationally
Very
different
microbial
communities
were
selected
in
all
of
the
microcosms
Similarities
between
DGGE
profiles
of
replicate
samples
from
a
single
microcosm
were
high
95
±
5
but
similarities
between
DGGE
profiles
from
replicate
microcosms
receiving
the

were
not
significantly
higher
than
those
between
microcosms
subjected
to

63
±
7
Therefore
it
is
apparent
that
the
different
communities
selected
can
not
be
attributed
to
the
level
of
inorganic
nutrients
present
in
different
microcosms
Bioremediation
treatments
dramatically
reduced
the
diversity
of
the
bacterial
community
The
decrease
in
diversity
could
be
accounted
for
by
a
strong
selection
for
bacteria
belonging
to
the
alkane-degrading
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter
group
On
the
basis
of
Shannon-Weaver
indices
rapid
recovery
of
the
bacterial
community
diversity
to
preoiling
levels
of
diversity
occurred
However
although
the
overall
diversity
was
similar
there
were
considerable
qualitative
differences
in
the
community
structure
before
and
after
the
bioremediation
treatments
Although
accidental
releases
account
for
only
a
small
percentage
of
the
oil
released
into
the
marine
environment
large
oil
spills
attract
much
public
attention
and
cause
environmental
concern
Spill
incidents
have
prompted
research
on
cost-effective
environmentally
benign

strategies
Physical
and
on
rare
occasions
chemical
methods
are
capable
of
rapidly
removing
the
majority
of

but
they
are
rarely

Natural

Bacteria
are
considered
to
represent
the
predominant
agents
of
hydrocarbon
degradation
in
the
environment
27
and
hydrocarbon-degrading
bacteria
are
ubiquitous
More
than
20
genera
of

bacteria

over
several
sub

As
a
single
species
typically
is
capable
of
degrading
only
a
limited
number
of
the
compounds
found
in
crude
oil
a
consortium
composed
of
many
different
bacterial
species
is
usually
involved
in
oil
degradation
Because
of
the
high
carbon
content
of
oil
and
the
low
level
of
other
nutrients
essential
for
microbial
growth
the
rate
and
extent
of
degradation
are
in
general
limited
by
the
low
availability
of
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
2
33
Consequently
growth
of
hydrocarbon-degrading
bacteria
and
hydrocarbon
degradation
can
be
strongly
enhanced
by
fertilization
with
inorganic
N
and
P.

has

Bioremediation
studies
have
in

been
dominated
by
an
empirical
approach
and
optimum
nutrient

levels
are
often
informed
by
laboratory
incubations
In
the
field
care
must
be
taken
in
supplying
optimum
concentrations
of
inorganic
nutrients
Too
high
concentrations
may
result
in
eutrophication
and
too
low
concentrations
may
result
in
suboptimal
biodegradation
A
better
understanding
of
the
systematic
effects
of
nutrient
amendment
on
biodegradative
microbial
populations
and
the
progress
of
bioremediation
would
assist
the
development
of
more
rational

Therefore
laboratory

The

to
the

by
the

The

by

phylogenetic

The

were
selected
because
DGGE
analysis
revealed
the

that

the

phylogenetic

of
the

that
they
belonged
to
a

range
of
phylogenetic
groups
with
none
dominating
the
clone

Table

and
Fig

Almost
half
of
the
clones
were
unique
meaning
that
their
ARDRA
type
was
only
encountered
once
in
a

library
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
not
to
catalogue
the
wider
diversity
of
the
bacterial
populations
present
in
the
beach
sediments
and
these
were
not
analyzed
further
The
high
diversity
was
also
indicated
by
the
fact
that
of
the
49
clones
sequenced
clones
with
similar
ARDRA
profiles
and

identity
were
encountered
only
twice
in

In

oiling

resulted
in
strong
dominance
by
a
few
ARDRA/sequence
types

This
decrease
in
diversity
was
also
illustrated
by
the
calculation
of
the
Shannon-Weaver
index
for
the

The

was
observed
for

indicated
that

significantly
improved

thus
showing
as
expected
21
that
oil
degradation
was
limited
by
the
supply
of
N
and
P.
Upon
repeated

a
temporary
increase
in
carbon

was
observed
indicating
that
at
these
time
points
N

were
still

factors
did
not
become

argues
against

other
than
oil
components
in
the
oil-contaminated
nutrient-amended
microcosms
Bragg
et

noted
a
positive
relationship
between
the
rate
of
oil
biodegradation
and
nitrogen
concentration
in
beach
sediment
pore
water
demonstrating
that
the
pore
water
nutrient
content
was
the
most
significant
factor
controlling
the
rate
of
oil
degradation
Our
results
concur
with
this
only
partly
Nutrient
addition
did
significantly
increase
the
oil
biodegradation
rate
However
even
though
the
various
nutrient
amendments
resulted
in
different
nutrient
levels
in
the
microcosms
and
initially
carbon
dioxide
production
rates
correlated
with
the
amount
of
added
inorganic
nutrients
over
the
full
period
of
the
experiment
the
rates
and
extent
of
oil
degradation
were
comparable
Experiments
conducted
with
lower
oil
concentrations
also
demonstrated
that
above
a
particular
level
of
nutrient
addition
nutrient
levels
did
not
further
enhance
oil
biodegradation

Furthermore
Lee

obtained
similar
results
and
showed
no
significant
difference
in
oil
degradation
in
a
field
experiment
using
low
and
high
concentrations
of
fertilizers
although
degradation
was
higher
than
in
oiled
unamended
plots
Reasons
for
these
differences
are
unknown
but
may
relate
to
differences
in
the
geology
of
the
beach
and
therefore
different
retention
characteristics
of
the
inorganic
nutrients
within
the
sediment
Bragg

the
study
by
Lee
et
al
28
and
our
study
were
performed
on
sandy
beach
material
Nevertheless
the
results
indicate
that
bioremediation
should
be
effective
despite
the
usual
patchy
oil
deposition
on
a
heterogeneous
beach
after
a
spill
and
similarly
uneven
distribution
of
inorganic
nutrients
supplied
during
bioremediation
N
and
P
were
supplied
at
different
concentrations
which
according
to
resource
ratio
theory
44
should
select
different
microbial
communities
dominated
by
the
organisms
most
capable
of
utilizing
the
inorganic
nutrients
at
the
levels
added
to
the
polluted
habitat
In
principle
this
could
offer
opportunities
to
direct
oil
degradation
21

Clear-cut
differences
in
bacterial
community
structure
were
found
in
microcosms
treated
with
different
levels
of
inorganic
nutrients
which
appears
consistent
with
the
predictions
of
resource
ratio
theory
However
statistical
analysis
of
DGGE
profiles
revealed
that
the
average
similarities
between
DGGE
profiles
from
three
independently
prepared
microcosms
receiving
the
same
amount

nutrients

N
were
not
significantly
different
from
the
similarities
between
microcosms
subjected
to
different
nutrient
amendments
Therefore
it
can
not
be
concluded
that
the
different
communities
selected
resulted
from
differences
in
nutrient
amendment
alone
It
is
unlikely
that
heterogeneity
within
the
microcosms
as
the
result
of
stratification
or
poor
mixing
of
oil
and
sediment/water
contributed
significantly
to
the
observed

the

constraints
on

Also
the

between
days

communities
had

the

revealed
that

similar

of

at
different
nutrient

This
observation
may
be
due
largely
to
the
strong
selection
for
a
few
members
of
the
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter
group
which
are

that
which

Oiling

bioremediation
led
to
a
strong

a

Recently
a
PAH-degrading
bacterium
most
closely
related
to
Erythrobacter
spp.
Lutibacterium
anuloederans
LC8
was
isolated
from
intertidal
beach
sediments

The
rRNA
gene
of
L.
anuloederans
shows
95.3
to
96.1
similarity
to
our
Erythrobacter-like
sequences
An
α-proteobacterial
sequence
related
to
Erythrobacter
spp
was
also
detected
in
beach
sediments
from
an
oil
spill
bioremediation
field
experiment
conducted
in
Delaware
30
Perhaps
the
most
dramatic
observation
made
in
the
present
study
was
the
rapid
and
strong
selection
for
γ-proteobacteria
in
oil-treated
microcosms
The
γ-proteobacteria
persisted
in
clone
libraries
from
sediment
samples
treated
with
oil
alone
taken
on
day
26
while
they
were
replaced
by
α-proteobacteria
in
microcosms
treated
with
oil
and
inorganic
nutrients
This
may
reflect
slow
ongoing
alkane
degradation
in
the
microcosms
not
treated
with
inorganic
nutrients
and
selection
of
organisms
growing
on
residual
PAH
and
secondary
products
of
hydrocarbon
degradation
in
the
bioremediated
microcosms
A
field
experiment
on
shoreline
sediments
in
the
Norwegian
Arctic
19
revealed
an
increase
in
γ-proteobacteria
in
oil-contaminated
beach
sediments
while
the
microbial
community
of
beached
oil
paste
after
the
Nakhodka
oil
spill
accident
in
the
Japan
Sea
was
also
dominated
by
γ-proteobacteria
25
These
results
are
consistent
with
our
observation
of
a
strong
dominance
by
γ-proteobacteria
and
this
may
be
a
characteristic
of
bacterial
communities
associated
with
recently
spilled
oil
In
our
case
it
was
mainly
members
of
the
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter
group
that
were
selected
Alcanivorax
borkumensis
48
and
Fundibacter
jadensis
5
were
described
recently
Both
are
capable
of
using
only
a
few
organic
substrates
especially
alkanes
5
48
and
the
alkyl
groups
of
n-alkylbenzenes
and
n-alkylcycloalkanes
11
Alkanes
are
major
oil
components
explaining
why
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter-like
sequences
made
a
significant
contribution
up
to
73
to
clone
libraries
early
in
the
bioremediation
process
and
for
a
longer
period
when
the
hydrocarbon
degradation
rate
was
lower
Because
of
biases
associated
with
PCR
and
cloning
47
these
clone
percentages
probably
do
not
directly
represent
Alcanivorax
cell
numbers
but
since
all
samples
were
analyzed
in
the
same
fashion
and
the
predominance
of
Alcanivorax-like
sequences
in
the
clone
libraries
was
so
dramatic
it
is
likely
that
our
results
do
reflect
a
genuine
increase
in
the
relative
abundance
of
this
group
of
bacteria
Furthermore
fluorescence
in
situ
hybridization
analyses
have
shown
that
Alcanivorax
constituted
more
than
90
of
the
entire
microbial
community
in
laboratory
incubations
of
seawater
supplemented
with
oil
43
Although
in
the
contaminated
microcosms
without
nutrient
treatment
0
N
no
significant
oil
degradation
occurred
over
the
28-day
incubation
period
remarkably
the
bacterial
communities
changed
considerably
and
the
predominance
of
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter-like
sequences
in
the
corresponding
clone
library
was
apparent
This
may
be
explained
by
the
release
of
nitrogen
and
phosphorus
from
biomass
killed
by
the
oil
supporting
limited
hydrocarbon
degradation
Interestingly
hydrocarbon
pollutants
can
induce
prophages
resulting
in
lysis
of
a
large
proportion
of
the
bacterial
community
9
23
and
this
may
explain
changes
in
community
composition
independent
of
extensive
oil
degradation
Even
in
the
absence
of
significant
hydrocarbon
degradation
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter-like
sequences
constituted
about
40
of
the
clone
libraries
constructed
from
samples
taken
at
days
6
and
26
from
the
unamended
oil-contaminated
control
microcosm
To
assess
if
this
is
a
consequence
of
relatively
very
low
rates
of
hydrocarbon
degradation
by
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter-like
bacteria
under
these
conditions
information
on
their
activity
would
be
required
for
example
measurement
of
mRNA
that
encodes
enzymes
involved
in
biodegradation
The
members
of
the
Alcanivorax/Fundibacter
group
appear
to
have
a
cosmopolitan
distribution
as
their
presence
has
been

The

indicates
that
they
may
be
of
considerable
global
significance
in

The
physiology
of
two
particularly
abundant
sequence
types
obtained
from
the
methanogenic
zone
could
be
inferred
from
their
phylogenetic
association
with
groups
of
microorganisms
with
a
consistent

One
of
these

types
is
associated
with
the
genus
Syntrophus
Syntrophus
spp
produce
energy
from
the
anaerobic

the

Methanosaetaspp.
which
are
known
to
be
capable
of
energy
generation
only
through
aceticlastic
methanogenesis
We
hypothesize
therefore
that
the
terminal
step
of
hydrocarbon
degradation
in
the
methanogenic
zone
of
the
aquifer
is
aceticlastic
methanogenesis
and
that
the
microorganisms
represented
by
these
two
sequence
types
occur
in
syntrophic
association
The
use
of
natural
attenuation
as
a
cleanup
method
for
underground
storage
tank
sites
with
petroleum-contaminated
soil
and
groundwater
has
increased
dramatically
over
the
last
few
years
Since
1995
natural
attenuation
has
been
the
most
common
treatment
for
contaminated
groundwater
and
the
second
most
common
treatment
for
contaminated
soil
at
these
sites
About
17,000
contaminated
groundwater
sites
47
of
active
sites
and
29,000

In
order
for
a
regulatory
agency
to
approve
the
cleanup
of
a
contaminated
site
via
natural
attenuation
the
occurrence
of
natural
attenuation
must
be
demonstrated
by
various
lines
of
evidence
One
such
line
of
evidence
is
historical
groundwater
and/or
soil
chemistry
data
that
demonstrate
decreasing
contaminant
mass
and/or
concentration
over
time
at
relevant
sampling
points
44
This
decrease
may
be
due
to
contaminant
sorption
dilution
volatilization
and
nonbiological
and
biological
breakdown
The
biological
breakdown
or
intrinsic
bioremediation
of
hydrocarbons
is
particularly
beneficial
because
it
ultimately
converts
hydrocarbons
to
carbon
dioxide
water
and
methane
rather
than
simply
repartitioning
the

alternate
methods

acceptors
in
the
plume
relative
to
the
uncontaminated
aquifer
for
the
occurrence

bioremediation
The
general
view
of
the
course
of
intrinsic
bioremediation
of
a
hydrocarbon-contaminated
aquifer
is
stepwise
microbial
utilization
of
electron
acceptors
with
sequential
utilization
of
the
electron
acceptors
that
provide
the
most
potential
energy
upon
concomitant
oxidation
of
the
hydrocarbon
Thus
oxygen
is
utilized
first
and
then
nitrate
bioavailable
ferric
iron
and
sulfate
are
utilized
After
sulfate
is
depleted
methanogenesis
is
thought
to
be
the
final
mode
of
carbon
cycling
5
Recent
studies
have
shown
however
that
sulfate
reduction
and
methanogenesis
may
take
place
concurrently
32
Also
aquifer
heterogeneity
and
influx
of
electron
acceptors
such
as
nitrate
and
sulfate
from
rainwater
complicate
the
picture
of
redox
zone
distribution
To
describe
the
microbial
constituents
of

we
conducted

of

Candidate

is
represented
by
13
Wurtsmith

including
one

WCHB1-26

to
be

in
all

of
the

Table

The
apparent

suggest
that
organisms
represented

may
play
significant

unknown
roles
in
the

for

The
present
study
of
the
Wurtsmith
aquifer
suggests
the
existence
of
six
novel
candidate
divisions
WS1
to
WS6
Fig

and

indicating
that
despite
recent

our
knowledge
of
the
extent
of
microbial
diversity
is
still
incomplete
even
at
the
division
level
Candidate
divisions
WS1
to
WS6
are
each
represented
by
only
one
to
three
Wurtsmith
sequence
types
but
together
comprise
10
of
the
total
number
of
sequence
types
analyzed
Study
of
additional
representatives
of
these

will
be

The

had
the
same
set
of
numerically
dominant
sequence
types
sequence
types
that
occurred
infrequently
differed
between
the
libraries
Table

The
composition
of
the
WSA
library
was
very
similar
to
those
of
the
WCHA
and
WsCH
libraries
indicating
that
the
two
soil
samples
were
possibly
from
geochemically
similar
environments
These
results
indicate
that
the
classification
of
the
two
samples
as
originating
from
different
redox
zones
may
need
reassessment
The
WFeA
library
had
a
suite
of
sequence
types
different
from
those
of
the
other
libraries
consistent
with
the
expectation
that
Fe3+
as
the
predominant
electron
acceptor
results
in
a
community
physiologically
distinct
from
the
methanogenic
community
Sequence
type
WFeA1-06
representing
17
of
the
WFeA
library
is
essentially
identical
to
sequence
types
found
in
several
environmental
clonal
studies
performed
on
diverse
habitats
by
our
laboratory
and
others
as
well
as
in
a
negative
control
no-sample
extraction
indicating
that
it
may
be
a
laboratory
contaminant
possibly
from
widely
used
reagents
42
The
amount
of
biomass
in
the
WFeA
sample
as
approximated
by
the
DNA
extracted
from
samples
was
much
lower
10-fold
than
in
the
other
samples
Since
the
Fe
horizon
is
at
the
leading
edge
of
hydrocarbon
dispersal
downward
in
the
plume
there
is
less
carbon
source
to
drive
communities
than
there
is
in
the
upper
horizons
Laboratory
contaminants
presumably
have
a
greater
chance
of
being
detected
in
libraries
created
from
low-biomass

The
composition
of
the
WCHD

reinforces
the
results
obtained
with
the
universal
methanogenic

that

This

to
gauge
the

at

The
only
previous
evidence
for
these
tertiary
interactions
was
the
occurrence
of
covariations
in
rRNA
sequences
from
some
organelles
and
a
few
Mycoplasma
spp
As
shown
in
Fig

the
environmental
sequences
significantly
expand
support
for
the
proposed
interactions
Although
most
of
the
new
sequences
support
the
proposed
tertiary
interactions
some
do
not
show
canonical
covariation

As
mentioned

these
changes

Physiological
hypotheses.Environmental
rDNA
sequences
in
principle
can
be
used
to
infer
some
properties
of
the
organisms
that
they
represent
If
a
sequence
is
related
to
those
of
a
group
of
cultivated
organisms
with
common
properties
then
the
environmental
organism
represented
only
by
the
sequence
also
is
expected
to
have
those
properties
One
barrier
to
deriving
physiological
hypotheses
from
this
study
is
that
many
of
the
sequences
are
not
specifically
related
to
cultivated
organisms
Indeed
the
numerically
dominant
sequence
types
in
the
bacterial
and
universal
libraries
from
methanogenic
soil
in
this
study
are
members
of
newly
recognized
candidate
divisions
OP11
and
OP5
for
which
no
cultivated
representatives
are
known
Nothing
is
known
about
the
physiology
of
these
bacteria
since
they
are
defined
only
by
sequences
obtained
from
the
environment
Any
physiological
interpretations
must
therefore
rely
heavily
on
the
environmental
conditions
of
a
sample
from
which
a
sequence
is
isolated
Based
on

that
organisms
in
a
Yellowstone

may
engage
in
sulfate

Of
course
many
organisms
that
are
closely
related
by
16S

have
different
physiologies

Some
of
the

encountered
at
the
Wurtsmith

however
are
related
sufficiently
closely
to
studied

that
reasonable

Consequently
we
believe
that
the
determination
of
abundances
of
sequence
types
in
a
clonal

survey
is
a
useful
first

in

in

In
a
methanogenic
ecosystem
polymers
such
as
polysaccharides
proteins
lipids
and
nucleic
acids
typically
are
broken
down
by
the
action
of
extracellular
hydrolytic
enzymes

Fatty
acids
in
turn
are
fermented
to
simpler
acids
including
acetate
hydrogen
and
carbon
dioxide
by
syntrophic
bacteria
that
rely
on
the
removal
of

by
other
microorganisms
to
render
the
energetics
of

The
fate
of
acetate
hydrogen
and
carbon
dioxide
depends
on
the
organisms
involved
hydrogen-oxidizing
methanogens
can
produce
methane
from
hydrogen
and
carbon
dioxide
homoacetogens
can
produce
acetate
from
hydrogen
and
carbon
dioxide
and
aceticlastic
methanogens
can
produce
methane
and
carbon
dioxide
from
acetate
Environmental
conditions
dictate
the
most
favorable
processes
Recent
studies
on
lake
sediments
and
other
cold
freshwater
environments
have
shown
that
at
temperatures
lower
than
20°C
methane
production
occurs
predominantly
by
aceticlastic
methanogenesis
and
that
hydrogen
is
consumed
preferentially
by
homoacetogens

This
temperature
effect
also
has
been
rationalized
thermodynamically
by
Schink
34
The
low
temperature
10
to
12°C
of
the
Wurtsmith
aquifer
and
the
dominance
in
the
methanogenic
zone
of
probable
aceticlastic
methanogens
indicate
that
aceticlastic
methanogenesis
is
primarily
important
in
hydrocarbon
degradation
in
this
environment
as
well
The
low
abundance
of
sequences
that
correspond
to
organisms
known
for
H2-CO2methanogenesis
is
consistent
with
this
notion
and
suggests
that
hydrogen
utilization
may
be
dominated
by
acetogenic
bacteria
that
are
not
yet
identifiable
by
rDNA
sequences
Overall
then
we
propose
that
the
degradation
of
petroleum
hydrocarbons
in
the
methanogenic
zone
of
the
Wurtsmith
aquifer
proceeds
by
initial
hydrolytic
attack
on
hydrocarbons
fermentation
of
the
resulting
organic
acids
by
syntrophic
bacteria
including
fermentation
of
the
simple
acids
by
microorganisms
represented
by
theSyntrophus-related
sequence
type
WCHB1-12
and
aceticlastic
methanogenesis
by
microorganisms
represented
by
theMethanosaeta-related
sequence
type
WCHD3-03
These
two
types
of
organisms
may
be
involved
in
a
syntrophic
relationship
in
the
Wurtsmith
aquifer
and
may
be
useful
indicator
organisms
for
the
evaluation
of
methanogenic
intrinsic
bioremediation
in
this
and
other
aquifers
It
remains
to
be
seen
however
if
these
or
similar
types
of
microorganisms
are
present
in
other
contaminated
aquifers
undergoing
methanogenic
intrinsic
bioremediation
Three
crude
oil
bioremediation
techniques
were
applied
in
a
randomized
block
field
experiment
simulating
a
coastal
oil
spill
Four
treatments
no
oil
control
oil
alone
oil
plus
nutrients
and
oil

plus
an
indigenous
inoculum
were
applied
In

microbial
community
structures
were
monitored
by
phospholipid
fatty

PLFA
analysis
and
16S

identify
the
bacterial

responsible
for
the

of
the
site
and
ii
define
an
end
point
for
the
removal
of
the
hydrocarbon
substrate
The
results
of
PLFA
analysis
demonstrated
a
community
shift
in
all
plots
from
primarily
eukaryotic
biomass
to
gram-negative
bacterial
biomass
with

PLFA
profiles
from
the
oiled
plots
suggested
increased
gram-negative
biomass
and
adaptation
to
metabolic
stress
compared
to
unoiled

DGGE
analysis
of
untreated
control
plots
revealed
a
simple
dynamic
dominant
population
structure
throughout
the
experiment
This
banding
pattern
disappeared
in
all
oiled
plots
indicating
that
the
structure
and
diversity
of
the
dominant
bacterial
community
changed
substantially
No
consistent
differences
were
detected
between
nutrient-amended
and
indigenous
inoculum-treated
plots
but
both
differed
from
the
oil-only
plots
Prominent
bands
were
excised
for
sequence
analysis
and
indicated
that
oil
treatment
encouraged
the
growth
of
gram-negative
microorganisms
within
the
α-proteobacteria
andFlexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides
phylum
α-Proteobacteria
were
never
detected
in
unoiled

PLFA

indicated
that
by

the
microbial
community
structures
of
the
oiled
plots
were
becoming
similar
to
those
of
the
unoiled
controls
from
the
same
time
point
but
DGGE
analysis
suggested
that
major
differences
in
the
bacterial
communities
remained
The
study
of
microbial
diversity
and
community
dynamics
is
rapidly
growing
in
microbial
ecology
Interest
in
this
area
has
been
catalyzed
by
the
rapid
advancement
of
molecular
ecological
methodologies
Through
the
use
of
culture-independent
molecular
techniques
new
insights
into
the
composition
of
uncultivated
microbial
communities
have
been
gained
see
reference11
for
an
excellent
review
It
is
now
becoming
possible
to
define
the
causes
of
time-dependent
changes
in
the
health
of
a
stressed
ecosystem
on
the
basis
of
the

of

In
particular
analysis
of
the
microbial
communities
that
take
part
in
in

hydrocarbon
biodegradation
activities
has
been
a
challenge
to
microbiologists
The
reason
for
this
is
that
most
∼90
to
99
of
the
species
making
up
competent

communities
do
not

These
methods
provide
insight
into
several
important
characteristics
of
microbial
communities
specifically
the
viable
biomass
community
structure
and
nutritional
status

of

37

Microbial
communities
within
contaminated
ecosystems
tend
to
be
dominated
by
those
organisms
capable
of
utilizing
and/or
surviving
toxic
contamination
As
a
result
these
communities
are
typically
less
diverse
than
those
in
nonstressed
systems
although
the
diversity
may
be
influenced
by
the
complexity
of
chemical
mixtures
present
and
the
length
of
time
the
populations
have
been
exposed
However
when
gram-negative
bacteria
dominate
the
system
as
is
usually
the
case
in
hydrocarbon-contaminated
environments
the
insight
gained
from
lipid
biomarker
analysis
primarily
concerns
nutritional
or
physiological
status
with
little
differentiation
among
bacterial
species
A
complementary
method
by
which
the
shift
in
such
a
microbial
community
structure
can
be
monitored
in
greater
detail
is
denaturing
gradient
gel
electrophoresis
DGGE
This
method
makes
use
of
the
16S
rDNA
molecule
carried
by
all
bacteria
the
sequences
of
which
provide
molecular
markers
for

Results
were

the

changed
during
the
course
of
the
14-week

whether
the

was
returning
to
the

structure
by
the

Such
a

would
strongly
indicate
that

These
represented
two
closely
related
sequences
within
the
gram-negative
Flexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides
phylum
it
might
be
significant
that
these
two
bands
did
not
appear
in
any
of
the
natural
attenuation
plots
but
the
contribution
of
these
species
to
the
enhanced
bioremediation
of
hydrocarbons
remains
speculative
Although
PLFA
analysis
suggested
the
presence
of
actinomycetes
and
sulfate-reducing
bacteria
no
sequences
related
to
cultured
members
of
either
group
were
recovered
from
any
sample
plot
indicating
that
both
groups
were
present
below
PCR-DGGE
detection
levels
as
applied

of

of

with
the

from
those
test
plots
at
week

showed
little
commonality
in
banding
pattern
Fig.8
Only
a
single
band
comigrating
with
Dw20
was
common
to
the
inoculum
and
the
inoculated
plots
but
this
band
was
also
common
to
uninoculated
plots
Thus
PCR-DGGE
did
not
suggest
that
any
part
of
the
inoculum
had
become
established
as
detectable
components
of
the
bacterial
community
The
results
of
PCR-DGGE
analysis
coupled
with
band
excision
and
sequence
analysis
were
in
good
agreement
with
the
PLFA
analysis
as
it
applied
to
the
bacterial
community
DGGE
analysis
suggested
that
the
bacterial
communities
of
the
unoiled
plots
were
dominated
by
gram-positive
microorganisms
during
the
14-week
study
The
bacterial
community
structures
revealed
by
PCR-DGGE
of
all
oiled
plots
demonstrated
a
marked
rise
in
the
proportion
of
species
belonging
to
the
α
subgroup
of
the
proteobacteria
and
also
a
less
pronounced
increase
in
species
of
the
Flexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroidesphylum
By
week
14
no
strong
bands
representing
gram-positive
microorganisms
were
detectable
in
any
oiled
plot
Thus
the
increase
in
the
relative
abundance
of
gram-negative
biomass
detected
in
oiled
plots
by
PLFA
analysis
could
be
tentatively
ascribed
to
the
growth
of
a
limited
number
of
species
related
to
these
two
groups
This
conclusion
is
in
close
agreement
with
the
viable
MPN
observations
showing
that
both
alkane
and
PAH
degraders
increased
significantly
within
the
first
2
weeks
after
oil
was
applied
to
the
plots
compared
to
the
unoiled
plots
The
disappearance
of
γ-subgroup
proteobacterial
species
as
a
major
component
of
the
bacterial
community
after
time
zero
was
common
to
all
samples
and
therefore
not
related
to
oiling
The
only
apparent
differences
between
oiled
treatments
that
were
related
to
the
abundance
of
gram-negative
bacteria
were
between
plots
receiving
nutrients
and
those
that
did
not
An
α-proteobacterium
related
to
the
genus
Sphingomonas
reached
detection
levels
in
at
least
one
natural
attenuation
plot
but
was
not
detected
in
plots
receiving
nutrients
In
all
plots
receiving
nutrients
two
closely
related
sequences
derived
from
members
of
theFlexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides
phylum
and
differing
by
a
single
base
pair
over
the
region
recovered
were
detected
It
is
noteworthy
that
these
two
bands
appeared
only
in
the
nutrient-amended
plots
and
not
in
the
natural
attenuation
plots
It
is
possible
that
the
appearance
of
the
source
microorganism
s
of
these
bands
was
directly
related
to
the
addition
of
biostimulating
nutrients
which
may
have
been
limiting
in
the
natural
attenuation
plots
thus
precluding
their
development
If
this
was
the
case
then
this
would
be
evidence
that
nutrient
addition
brought
about
a
change
in
the
microbial
ecology
in
the
treated
plots
that
may
at
least
partially
have
caused
the
significantly
higher
biodegradation
rates
in
these
plots
Although
PLFA
analysis
indicated
that
the
overall
microbial
community
structures
of
all
plots
were
becoming
more
similar
by
week
14
PCR-DGGE
analysis
indicated
that
at
a
finer
scale
considerable
differences
between
the
bacterial
communities
of
oiled
and
unoiled
samples
persisted
It
is
well
established
that
PCR-DGGE
as
applied
can
detect
microorganisms
which
represent
only
1
to
2
of
the
target
group
19
28
Therefore
the
method
used
is
incapable
of
detecting
minor
community
components
that
may
be
essential
in
the
degradation
of
specific
hydrocarbon
classes
When
the
plots
treated
by
addition
of
nutrients
and
those
treated
by
addition
of
nutrients
and
a
hydrocarbon-degrading
inoculum
derived
from
the
same
site
were
compared
no
differences
in
the
rate
of
bioremediation
of
crude
oil
or
community
structure
as
determined
by
either
PLFA
PCR-DGGE
or
MPN
analysis
were
detected
In
an
attempt
to
explain
this
PCR-DGGE
was
used
to
compare
the
bacterial
community
structures
of
the
inoculum
with
those
of
the
plot
to
which
it
was
added
Although
the
results
are
not
definitive
few
if
any
of
the
bands
recovered
from
the
inoculum
comigrated
with
any
of
the
visible
bands
recovered
from
the
inoculation
plots
indicating
that
the
inoculated
bacteria
did
not
compete
favorably
with
the
indigenous
bacterial
community
even
though
they
were
originally
derived
from
a
nearby
beach
This
may
be
one
explanation
for
the
ineffectiveness
of
the
inoculum
Another
explanation
would
be
the
relatively
low
numbers
of
degraders
present
in
the
inoculum
to
begin
with
The
density
of
viable
alkane
and
PAH
degraders
in
the

1.9

For

to

should
be

equal
to

than

This
second
activation
strategy
was
mainly
developed
from
the
growth
pattern
of
the
sulfidogenic
strain
Hxd3
On
the
basis
of
metabolite
analysis
C-even
and
C-odd
cellular
fatty
acids
were
formed
from
C-odd
and
C-even
n-alkanes
respectively
Aeckersberg
et
al.
1998
So
et
al.
2003
Growth
of
Hxd3
with
different
chain
lengths
of
non-labeled
alkanes
in
the
presence
of
H13CO3−
resulted
in
the
formation
of
fatty
acids
that
are
one
carbon
atom
shorter
than
the
original
alkane
Furthermore
their
fatty
acids
carboxyl
group
contains
a
13C
atom
suggesting
that
H13CO3−
was
directly
involved
in
the
initial
activation
of
alkanes
in
strain
Hxd3
Therefore
strain
Hxd3
would
metabolize
an
alkane
to
fatty
acids
via
carboxylation
with
inorganic
carbon
HCO3−/CO2
most
likely
at
C-3
with
subsequent
removal
of
two
sub-terminal
carbon
atoms
from
the
alkane
chain
Fig
3B
More
recently
from
an
alkane-degrading
nitrate-reducing
consortium
Callaghan
et
al
2009
indicated
that
a
carboxylation-like
mechanism
analogous
to
the
activation
strategy
previously
proposed
by
So
et
al
2003
was
the
likely
route
for
the
anaerobic
biodegradation
of
hexadecane
However
in
both
cases
the
hypothetical
fatty
acid
intermediate
2-ethylalkanoate
which
should
result
from
the
incorporation
of
inorganic
carbon
at
C-3
of
the
alkane
has
never
been
detected
There
is
an
on-going
debate
about
this
initial
activation
mechanism
From
an
energetic
point
of
view
the
carboxylation
of
alkanes
is
not
feasible
under
standard
conditions
ΔG°′
+28
kJ/mol
unless
the
concentration
of
the
fatty
acid
2-ethylalkanoate
is
in
the
micromolar
order
of
magnitude
or
less
otherwise
this
reaction
will
not
proceed
under
physiological
conditions
Thauer
and
Shima
2008
The
possibility
of
other
reaction
s
preceding
the
carboxylation
has
also
been
proposed
So
et
al
2003

Alternative
activation
mechanisms
Depending
on
the
microorganisms
and
electron
acceptors
available
in
a
selective
environment
anaerobic
degradation
of
alkanes
may
proceed
via
alternative
activation
mechanisms
not
involving
addition
of
fumarate
or
carboxylation
For
instance
Pseudomonas
chloritidismutans
AW-1T
is
able
to
produce
its
own
oxygen
via
chlorate
respiration
for
subsequent
metabolism
of
alkanes
Fig
3C-1
Mehboob
et
al
2009
This
would
indicate
the
requirement
for
oxygenases
to
incorporate
molecular
oxygen
thus
generated
from
the
dismutation
of
chlorite
into
the
alkane
Such
a
reaction
is
referred
to
as
“
unusual
oxygenation
”
of
alkane
since
it
takes
place
in
the
total
exclusion
of
air
A
similar
activation
strategy
via
“
intra-cellular
oxygen
production
”
is
also
possible
with
electron
acceptors
such
nitrate
or
nitrite
Ettwig
et
al
2010
However
in
a
recent
work
it
was
presumed
that
nitrite
or
nitric
oxide
generated
during
the
reduction
of
nitrate
may
be
directly
involved
as
a
co-reactant
for
the
activation
of
alkanes
in
strain
HdN1
Fig
3C-2
Zedelius
et
al
2010
Given
that
the
activation
metabolite
of
NO2−
or
NO
co-reacting
with
alkanes
is
still
unknown
this
hypothesis
remains
to
be
demonstrated
Another
recently
proposed
strategy
may
involve
anaerobic
hydroxylation
of
oil
alkanes
Fig
3C-3
Pyrosequencing
of
total
genomic
DNA
retrieved
from
methanogenic
enrichment
cultures
degrading
crude
oil
revealed
the
presence
of
genes
encoding
the
β-oxidation
pathway
and
also
alcohol
and
aldehyde
dehydrogenase
genes
The
absence
of
assA-like
genes
and
metabolites
that
would
have
indicate
an
addition
to
the
double
bond
of
fumarate
or
even
likely
a
carboxylation
suggest
that
oil
alkanes
in
the
methanogenic
enrichment
culture
are
probably
activated
via
anaerobic
hydroxylation

Conclusions
and
future
perspectives
Alkanes
are
quantitatively
the
most
important
fraction
in
crude
oil
The
anaerobic
biodegradation
of
alkanes
which
has
now
been
documented
to
occur
in
anoxic
habitats
is
of
great
importance
for
the
oil
industry
Today
this
process
remains
an
exciting
area
of
investigation
to
understand
the
factors
that
govern
the
biodegradation
of
oil
in
deep-subsurface
reservoirs
and
for
the
bioremediation
of
oil-contaminated
environments
It
is
now
well-established
that
microbial
activities
associated
with
petroleum
reservoirs
have
led
to
the
decrease
of
oil
quality
making
refining
more
costly
and
recovery
more
difficult
Head
et
al
2003
Examination
of
deep-subsurface
petroleum
reservoirs
has
revealed
the
presence
of
live
microbial
communities
dominated
by
anaerobes
therefore
oil
reservoirs
have
been
referred
to
as
“
geobioreactors
”
in
which
different
physiological
types
of
anaerobic
microorganisms
including
fermentative
syntrophic
sulfidogenic
and
methanogens
may
be
responsible
for
the
biodegradation
of
crude
oil
in
situ
with
the
preferential
removal
of
the
saturated
hydrocarbon
fraction

Petroleum
reserves
have
been
depleted
to
certain
levels
and
anaerobic
degradation
is
considered
to
be
one
of
the
major
processes
responsible
for
this
phenomenon
Moreover
biogenic
methane
that
is
commonly
associated
with
biodegraded
oil
reservoirs
is
believe
to
be
a
result
of
the
microbial
decomposition
of
oil
alkanes
Jones
et
al
2008
While
methanogenic
degradation
of
oil
alkanes
has
significant
effect
on
the
recovery
of
high-value
light
crude
oil
on
the
positive
side
in

methanogenic
biodegradation
activities
may
offer
a
route
for
potential
alternative
and
innovative
energy
recovery
strategies
from
existing
oil
reservoirs
after
extraction
After
extensive
water
flooding
at
least
two-third
of
the
crude
oil
still
remains
entrapped
in
pores
within
the
formation
the
recovery
of
energy
from
conventional
reserves
via
in
situ
conversion
of
even
a
smaller
fraction
of
the
residual
oil
to
methane
gas
could
represent
a
considerable
supply
of
energy
This
is
great
interest
because
world
requirements
for
methane
are
estimated
to
increase
within
the
next
three
decades

and
methanogenic
conversion
of
oil
alkanes
is
seen
as
a
future
solution
for
world
energy
needs

However
there
are
still
many
questions
regarding
the
anaerobic
biodegradation
of
alkanes
that
need
to
be
addressed
For
instance
though
the
isolation
of
anaerobic
microorganisms
capable
of
utilizing
alkanes
has
been
essential
for
a
comprehensive
understanding
of
their
role
and
behavior
in
anoxic
habitats
the
complex
interactions
within
methanogenic
alkane-degrading
communities
are
still
not
well
understood
Further
research
is
needed
to
explore
multidisciplinary
e.g.
molecular
microbiological
and
chemical
or
geochemical
approaches
to
establish
the
key
organisms
biochemical
reactions
and
mechanisms
involved
in
such
complex
associations
For
instance
there
is
now
reasonable
circumstantial
evidence
that
some
fermentative
bacteria
such
as
Firmicutes
might
be
directly
implicated
in
the
degradation
of
hydrocarbons
It
is
also
worth
noting
that
microorganisms
affiliated
to
Firmicutes
are
the
most
commonly
encountered
bacterial
taxon
in
samples
retrieved
from
oil
reservoirs
Gray
et
al
2010
hence
diverse
and
abundant
members
of
the
Firmicutes
should
not
only
be
considered
as
“
traditional
”
fermentative
bacteria
they
could
have
adapted
to
metabolize
oil
components
in
situ
and
in
methanogenic
oil
degrading
enrichment
cultures
Sulfidogenic
prokaryotes
however
are
metabolically
versatile
and
are
able
to
grow
either
by
using
sulfate
as
electron
acceptor
or
by
syntrophic
lifestyle
in
the
absence
of
electron
acceptor
This
characteristic
makes
them
important
members
of
degradative
microbial
communities
Davidova
et
al
2006
reported
that
Desulfoglaeba
alkanexedens
ALDCT
is
able
to
syntrophically
degrade
alkanes
in
co-culture
with
hydrogenotrophic
methanogens
Interestingly
several
sulfudogenic
with
the
capacity
for
alkane
oxidation
are
able
to
utilize
thiosulfate
sulfite
or
elemental
sulfur
as
electron
acceptors
to
enhance
their
growth
yield
and
rates
This
is
of
great
importance
because
organic
sulfur
compounds
present
in
crude
oils
can
serve
as
sulfur-based
electron
acceptors
Röling
et
al
2003
The
capability
of
T.
sibiricus
and
related
organisms
to
use
organic
substrates
such
alkanes
without
needs
for
exogenous
electron
acceptors
makes
them
potential
key
players
of
the
complex
metabolic
food
web
existing
in
habitats
such
as
high
temperature
petroleum
reservoirs

The
role
of
hyperthermophilic
organisms
such
as
Thermococcus
sp
and
Archaeglobus
sp
in
oil
reservoirs
is
not
well
understood
Analysis
of
existing
genomic
data
has
started
to
reveal
their
potentiality
It
is
tempting
to
speculate
that
in
high
temperature
petroleum
reservoirs
these
archaeal
members
play
a
considerable
role
during
the
initial
steps
of
the
anaerobic
metabolism
of
alkanes
Information
on
the
potential
of
biodegradation
can
be
obtained
from
specific
intermediates
metabolites
where
their
detection
is
indicative
of
microbial
activities
on
a
given
substrate
Moreover
functional
genes
encoding
key
enzymes
of
specific
degradation
pathways
can
also
serve
as
biomarkers
For
instance
studies
on
alkylsuccinate
genes
by
means
of
assA-targetd
primer
sets
have
provided
evidence
for
the
importance
of
novel
groups
of
anaerobic
alkane-degraders
and
the
major
role
played
by
glycyl
radical
dependent
addition
to
fumarate
Callaghan
et
al
2010
However
physiologically
distinct
microorganisms
e.g.
strain
Hxd3
utilize
fumarate-independent
mechanisms
to
activate
their
alkane
substrates
Therefore
additional
research
at
the
genomic
level
will
be
necessary
to
reveal
the
genetic
associated
with
these
new
biochemical
pathways
Finally
understanding
the
alkanes
degrading
communities
with
their
biochemical
function
will
significantly
advance
the
knowledge
about
the
organisms
mediating
the
specialized
biochemical
reaction
steps
This
will
allow
us
to
better
understand
the
biological
processes
responsible
for
oil
biodegradation
in
natural
environments
and
in
petroleum
reservoirs
for
possible
biotechnological
innovation
and
applications
in
utilization
of
the
residual
oils
Saturated
hydrocarbons
are
quantitatively
the
most
abundant
fraction
among
all
petroleum
hydrocarbons
Significant
advances
have
been
made
in
the
understanding
of
the
anaerobic
biodegradability
of
alkanes
in
terms
of
the
microorganisms
involved
and
the
biochemical
pathways
over
the
past
two
decades
They
can
be
used
as
carbon
and
energy
sources
by
diverse
physiological
groups
of
microorganisms
isolates
or
consortia
grown
under
chlorate-reducing
nitrate-reducing
sufidogenic
or
methanogenic
conditions
Two
general
biochemical
mechanisms
have
been
proposed
for
the
initial
activation
of
alkanes
including
addition
of
fumarate
and
carboxylation
However
glycyl
radical
enzymes
dependent
fumarate
addition
which
yields
alkyl-substituted
succinate
appear
to
be
the
most
commonly
shared
mechanism
for
the
anaerobic
attack
of
alkanes
under
various
redox
conditions
by
phylogenetically
diverse
microorganisms
The
genes
encoding
the
candidate
alkylsuccinate
synthase
have
been
recently
described
in
alkane-degrading
sulfate-
and
nitrate-reducers
as
well
as
in
hydrocarbon-rich
environments
Alternative
mechanisms
may
also
be
available
depending
on
the
alkane-degrading
microbial
community
and
electron
acceptors
utilized
Petroleum
crude
oil
is
a
complex
mixture
that
contains
thousands
of
distinctively
different
chemical
components
but
mainly
hydrocarbon
Hydrocarbon
composition
of
crude
oil
can
be
separated
into
four
main
fractions
namely
saturated
hydrocarbons
aromatic
resins
and
asphaltenes
These
compounds
are
relatively
less
reactive
due
to
the
lack
of
functional
groups
and
low
water
solubility
Nevertheless
microorganisms
can
grow
with
hydrocarbons
as
the
sole
source
of
carbon
and
energy
coupled
with
different
electron
acceptors
However
the
initial
attack
of
hydrocarbons
remains
the
critical
step
for
the
subsequent
metabolism
of
these
apolar
substrates
Furthermore
the
incorporation
of
molecular
oxygen
into
the
hydrocarbon
molecules
by
the
activity
of
oxygenases
in
the
initial
step
is
a
strictly
oxygen-dependent
biochemical
process
and
energetically
favorable
Chakraborty
and
Coates
2004
Wentzel
et
al.
2007
However
biodegradation
of
hydrocarbons
in
the
absence
of
molecular
oxygen
is
often
hindered
by
the
chemical
inertness
of
the
carbon–carbon
bonds
Obviously
microorganisms
capable
of
anaerobic
biodegradation
of
hydrocarbons
must
have
developed
alternative
oxygen-independent
biochemical
reactions
and
the
required
enzymes
for
the
initial
attack
of
these
substrates
under
oxygen-limited
conditions
Today
anaerobic
degradation
of
hydrocarbons
remains
an
interesting
area
of
research
for
understanding
the
mechanisms
of
petroleum
biodegradation
in
oil
reservoirs
and
for
bioremediation
of
oil-contaminated
environments
Major
attention
has
recently
been
paid
to
the
microbial
ecology
of
petroleum
reservoirs
where
anaerobes
are
the
dominant
microorganisms

Isolation
and/or
characterization
of
such
microorganisms
are
of
great
importance
for
understanding
of
the
biochemical
mechanisms
responsible
for
oil
biodegradation
in
natural
environments
and
in
petroleum

The
anaerobic
biodegradability
of
hydrocarbons
has
been
investigated
since
the
1940s
however
the
biodegradation/biotransformation
of
these
compounds
in
the
absence
of
molecular

Biodegradation
of
alkanes
in
anoxic
environments
has
been
for
years
a
subject
of
debate
only
at
the
theoretical
level
The
first
experimental
demonstration
of
this
hypothesis
was
accomplished
by
the
quantitative
measurement
of
the
consumption
of
n-alkanes
by
sulfate-reducing
bacteria
Aeckersberg
et
al
1991
Since
then
sulfate-
nitrate-
and
chlorate-reducing
bacteria
grown
anaerobically
with
saturated
hydrocarbons
as
the
sole
carbon
and
energy
sources
have
been
demonstrated
Furthermore
the
isolated
anaerobic
alkane-degrading
microorganisms
were
not
closely
related
to
previously
established
species
e.g.
Desulfovibrio
or
Pseudomonas
strains

revealed
novel

The
main
scope
of
this
review
lies
on
the
diversity
and
physiology
of
microorganisms
capable
of
anaerobic
degradation
of
alkanes
under
nitrate
sulfidogenic

methanogenic

No
studies
have
been
reported
on
the
degradation
of
alkanes
under

For

Given
the

of
the
current
review
a
brief
overview
of
the
anaerobic

is
provided
with
emphasize
on
the
predominant
role
of

Anaerobic

of
alkanes
Alkanes
that
have
been
shown
to
be
biodegradable
under
anoxic

can
be
classified
into

From
a
thermodynamic
point
of
view
anaerobic
biodegradation
of
alkanes
with
various
electron
acceptors
is
feasible

Biodegradation
of
alkanes
by
specific
groups
of
microorganisms
is
discussed
below
Anaerobic
degradation
of
hydrocarbons
under
nitrate-reducing
conditions
has
been
regarded
as
an
effective
strategy
for
bioremediation
of
crude
oil
fuel-contaminated
aquifers
and
underground
storage
tanks
Rabus
and
Widdel
1996
The
use
of
nitrate
for
in
situ
remediation
of
these
contaminated
environments
has
been
driven
not
only
by
the
favorable
energetics
of
nitrate
reduction
but
also
by
high
water
solubility
and
mobility
of
nitrate
92.1
g/100
ml
water
at
25
°C
Crude
oil
and
its
refined
products
constitute
the
major
sources
of
alkanes
in
the
environment
Ehrenreich
et
al
2000
Due
to
their
very
low
solubility
in
water
long-chain
alkanes
C12
are
generally
not
considered
as
toxic
However
at
high
concentrations
relatively
short-chain
alkanes
C5–C12
and
cyclic
alkanes
have
negative
effects
on
biological
membranes

and
Ratledge

The
fate
of
alkanes
and
the
effectiveness
of
bioremediation
strategies
under
such
conditions
require
a
better
knowledge
of
the
biochemical
capacities
of
nitrate-reducing
microorganisms
Anaerobic
oxidation
of
hydrocarbons
coupled
to
the
reduction
of
nitrate
was
first
demonstrated
with
pure
isolates
strains
ToN1
mXyN1
EbN1
and
PbN1
for
utilization
of
alkylbenzenes
in
crude
oil
Rabus
and
Widdel
1996
Furthermore
a
nitrate-reducing
enrichment
culture
incubated
with
crude
oil
did
not
show
any
degradation
of
alkanes
C5
to
C12
until
alkylbenzenes
C1
to
C3
were
completely
depleted
This
indicated
that
the
enrichment
culture
exhibited
biphasic
growth
in
which
alkanes
were
only
partially
consumed
and
among
them
n-hexane
appeared
to
be
the
preferred
substrate
Cell
hybridization
further
revealed
that
the
majority
of
the
enriched
denitrifiers
affiliated
with
the
β-subclass
of
the
Proteobacteria
Rabus
et
al
1999
Ecological
distribution
of
anaerobic
hydrocarbons
degrading
denitrifiers
is
not
restricted
to
hydrocarbon-contaminated
habitats
since
they
have
been
commonly
isolated
from
non-contaminated
environments

The
currently
known
pure
isolates
of
alkane-degrading
nitrate
respiring
bacteria
NRB
are
affiliated
with
the
β-
and
γ-subclass
of
the
Proteobacteria
At
least
six
axenic
cultures
of
alkane-degrading
NRB
have
been
documented
so
far
Fig

and
Table

Strains
OcN1
and
HxN1were
isolated
with
n-octane
and
n-hexane
respectively
from
enrichment
cultures
prepared
from
ditch
sediments
The
two
isolates
are
members
of
the
family
Rhodocyclaceae
within
the
β-Proteobacteria
Ehrenreich
et
al
2000
These
strains
are
able
to
grow
for
complete
oxidation
of
C6–C12n-alkanes
to
CO2
with
transitory
production
of
nitrite
observed
during
the
growth
of
strain
HxN1
Ehrenreich
et
al
2000
When
grown
anaerobically
with
crude
oil
strain
HxN1
has
been
shown
to
co-metabolize
short-chain
C4–C5
and
cyclic
alkanes
cyclopentane
and
methylcyclo-pentane
in
addition
to
the
utilization
of
C6
to
C8n-alkanes
as
substrates
Wilkes
et
al
2003
This
is
of
great
interest
because
n-butane
n-propane
and
cyclic
alkanes
as
single
substrate
could
not
support
the
growth
of
strain
HxN1
indicating
that
such
co-metabolism
of
structurally
diverse
substrates
is
catalyzed
by
enzymes
which
are
needed
for
the
metabolism
of
the
growth-supporting
substrates
but
exert
activities
on
co-substrates
due
to
“
relaxed
substrate
specificities
”
similar
to
that
observed
with
anaerobic
alkylbenzene-degrading
bacteria
Beller
and
Spormann

et

Based

however
is
closely

Anaerobic
oxidation
of
long-chain
n-alkanes
C12
coupled
to
the
reduction
of
nitrate
is
apparently
restricted
to
members
of
the
γ-Proteobacteria
Axenic
cultures
include
strain
HdN1
from
activated

bacterium
Pseudomonas
balearica
strain
BerOc6
from
a
brakish
lagoon
Grossi
et

These
cultured
members
of
the
γ-Proteobacteria
are
able
to
oxidize
n-alkanes
ranging
from
C14
to
C20
Phylogenetic
analysis
based
on
16S
rRNA
gene
sequences
shows
that
strain
HdN1
forms
its
own
cluster
and
probably
represent
a
new
lineage
within
the
γ-Proteobacteria

the
dominant
presence
of
several
members
of
the

One

retrieved

Anaerobic
oxidation
of
branched
and
cyclic
alkanes
has
also
been
demonstrated
to
occur
under
nitrate-reducing
conditions
Pristane
2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane
C19H40
formerly
regarded
as
recalcitrant
under
anaerobic
conditions
has
been
shown
to
be
biodegraded
under
nitrate-reducing
conditions
in
enrichment
cultures
obtained
from
a
diesel
fuel-contaminated
sediments
Bregnard
et
al
1997
Within
the
cycloalkanes
family
cyclohexane
has
always
been
the
model
substrate
for
biodegradation
studies
Trower
et
al.
1985
Rouvière
and
Chen
2003
however
all
these
studies
were
conducted
under
aerobic
conditions
As
described
above
the
first
direct
evidence
for
the
anaerobic
oxidation
of
cycloalkanes
e.g.
cyclopentane
was
found
in
the
nitrate-reducing
strain
HxN1
grown
anaerobically
with
n-alkanes
from
crude
oil
the
identity
of
the
microorganisms
capable
of
anaerobic
degradation
of
cycloalkanes
under
nitrate-reducing
conditions
is
still
unknown
A
recent
study
on
anaerobic
degradation
of
cyclohexane
under
nitrate-reducing
conditions
resulted
in
the
co-enrichment
of
members
of
the
δ-Proteobacteria
and
Planctomycetales
This
enriched
culture
of
freshwater
denitrifying
bacteria
grown
anaerobically
with
cyclohexane
as
the
sole
carbon
and
energy
source
was
dominated
by
16S
rRNA
gene
sequence
related
to
Geobacter
spp
∼75
of
all
cells
as
detected
by
phylogenetic
analysis
and
fluorescent
whole-cell
hybridization
using
type-specific
probe
the
likely
cyclohexane-degrader
Subsequent
nitrite
produced
during
growth
of
the
consortium
was
not
consumed
unless
extra
ammonium
was
added
to
the
medium
These
observations
indicated
that
the
Planctomycetales
anammox
bacteria
as
a
partner
approximating
18
of
all
cells
was
consuming
nitrite
via
anaerobic
ammonium
oxidation
Musat
et
al
2010
Such
symbiotic
association
between
hydrocarbon-degraders
and
anammox
bacteria
can
be
extrapolated
from
environments
such
as
petroleum
reservoirs
where
anammox
bacteria
have
also
been
identified
as
potential
contributors
to
the
nitrogen
recyclers
Li
et
al
2010
It
should
be
reminded
that
Geobacter
species
are
often
the
predominant
microorganisms
found
in
hydrocarbon-contaminated
environments
in
which
Fe
III
-reduction
occur
Zwolinski
et
al
2000
and
given
that
Fe
III
-reduction
coupled
to
alkanes
degradation
has
not
yet
been
unequivocally
demonstrated
despite
some
experimental
attempts
So
and
Young
2001
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
Geobacter
spp
related
to
those
identified
by
Musat
et
al
2010
may
be
able
to
accomplish
this
task
The
research
interest
in
hydrocarbons
utilization
by
sulfidogenic
microorganisms
stems
from
observations
of
sulfide
formation
during
maturation
of
oil
reservoirs
Indeed
these
microorganisms
have
always
been
identified
or
isolated
from
hydrocarbon-rich
environments
such
as
in
petroleum
deposits
hydrocarbon
seeps
methane
hydrates
petroleum-rich
hydrothermal
sediments
underground
oil
storage
tanks
and
hydrocarbon-contaminated
sediments

Phylogenetic
analysis
based
on
16S
rRNA
and
functional
genes
suggest
that
sulfate-reducing
bacterial
SRB
communities
retrieved
from
these
environments
are
predominantly
affiliated
with
members
of
the
family
Desulfobacteraceae
within
the
δ-Proteobacteria
Most
members
of
this
family
are
strict
anaerobes
that
perform
complete
oxidation
of
organic
compounds
In
contrast
to
nitrate
reducers
sulfate-reducers
that
anaerobically
oxidize
saturated
hydrocarbons
are
likely
indigenous
to
hydrocarbon-rich
environments

it

that

compared
to
the
Paleococcus

Methanogenesis
Methanogenesis
is
referred
to
as
the
biological
formation
of
methane
that
is
carried
out
by
strictly
anaerobic
microorganisms
The
anaerobic
decomposition
of
complex
organic
matter
to
methane
requires
the
concerted
effort
of
metabolically
different
types
of
microorganisms
Typically
this
mutual
dependence
is
commonly
described
as
syntrophic
cooperation
based
on
the
transfer
of
formate
hydrogen
and
acetate
from
fermentative
organisms
to
methanogens
The
overall
biodegradation
process
becomes
thermodynamically
favorable
only
when
the
methanogenic
substrates
generated
during
the
‘
cracking
’
of
complex
organic
matter
are
promptly
used
by
methanogens
in
order
to
keep
their
concentrations
at
a
very
low
level
Schink
1997
The
greatest
energy
conservation
with
a
given
alkane
substrate
is
obviously
to
be
expected
when
nitrate
nitrite
chlorate
or
ferric
iron
is
used
as
the
final
electron
acceptor
Methanogenic
degradation
is
the
least
energetically
favorable
process
when
compared
to
other
anaerobic
respirations
Table

The
biodegradation
of
alkanes
under
methanogenic
conditions
was
first
demonstrated
in
highly
enriched
cultures
obtained
from
ditch
mud
with
the
ability
to
convert
hexadecane
into
methane
and
CO2
Zengler
et
al
1999
so
far
no
isolates
had
been
obtained
and
only
a
few
studies
have
provided
the
phylogeny
of
microorganisms
potentially
involved
in
this
syntrophic
association
Zengler
et
al.
1999
Gieg
et

Jones
et
al.
2008
In
the
ditch
mud
methanogenic
enrichment
degrading
hexadecane
it
was
assumed
that
the
community
was
essentially
composed
of
i
syntrophic
proton-reducing
acetogenic
bacteria
Syntrophus
spp
which
decompose
the
alkane
to
acetate
and
H2
ii
a
group
of
archaea
Methanosaeta
which
form
methane
and
CO2
from
acetate
and
iii
another
group
of
archaea
Metanospirillum
and
Methanoculleus
converting
CO2
and
H2
to
methane
Zengler
et
al
1999
In
this
enrichment
it
was
suggested
that
more
than
2/3
of
the
methane
produced
was
from
acetate
Similarly
in
the
methanogenic
residual
oil
degrading
enrichment
culture
derived
from
a
gas
condensate
contaminated
subsurface
sediments
the
archaeal
sequences
whose
closest
matches
were
almost
exclusively
cultivated
methanogens
were
predominantly
affiliated
with
acetoclastic
Methanosaeta
spp
The
eubacterial
clone

was
more
diverse
with
the
majority
of

based
on
16S

related
to

phylotypes
including
some
presumptive
Gram-positive
sulfate-reducing
hydrocarbon-degrading
genera
related
to
Pelotomaculum
spp
Gieg
et
al.
2008
Abu
Laban
et
al.
2009
as
well
as
the
syntrophic
bacteria
Desulfotomaculum
cluster
I
Gieg
et
al
2008
Among
the
other
constituents
of
the
eubacterial
community
were
members
of
the
δ-Proteobacteria
Desulfobulbus
Desulfovibrio
and
Smithella
as
well
as
fermentative
bacteria
affiliated
with
Chloroflexi
Bacteroidetes
and
Actinobacteria
Gieg
et
al
2008
Data
obtained
from
the
methanogenic
enrichment
cultures
described
above
suggest
that
acetoclastic
methanogenesis
may
represent
an
important
biochemical
pathway
for
the
formation
of
methane
from
crude
oil
components
This
assumption
is
further
supported
by
thermodynamic
calculations
indicating
that
hexadecane
conversion
to
methane
is
driven
primarily
through
acetoclastic
methanogenesis
Dolfing
et
al
2008
In
contrast
the
methanogenic
oil
alkane-degrading
enrichment
derived
from
estuarine
sediments
was
found
to
be
dominated
by
Syntrophus
spp
and
CO2-reducing
methanogens
among
several
other
phylotypes
Jones
et
al
2008
Thus
the
principal
route
whereby
oil
alkanes
are
converted
to
methane
was
assumed
to
involve
syntrophic
alkane
conversion
to
acetate
and
hydrogen
linked
to
syntrophic
acetate
oxidation
to
H2
and
CO2
and
coupled
with
methanogenesis
from
CO2-reduction—the
so
called
MADCOR
process
This
assumption
is
supported
by
modeling
of
isotopic
signatures
for
CO2
and
methane
gases
collected
from
heavily
degraded
oils
of

Overall
these

Biochemical

The

of
alkanes
is
critical
for
their

During
the

numerous

the

mechanisms
of
alkanes

developed
unprecedented
biochemical
strategies
to

of

Heider

These
strategies
involved
in
the

of

include
activation

Abstract
Marine
subsurface
environments
such
as
deep-sea
sediments
house
abundant
and
diverse
microbial
communities
that
are
believed
to
influence
large-scale
geochemical
processes
These
processes
include
the
biotransformation
and
mineralization
of
numerous
petroleum
constituents
Thus
microbial
communities
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
are
thought
to
be
responsible
for
the
intrinsic
bioremediation
of
crude
oil
released
by
the
Deepwater
Horizon
DWH
oil
spill
While
hydrocarbon
contamination
is
known
to
enrich
for
aerobic
oil-degrading
bacteria
in
deep-seawater
habitats
relatively
little
is
known
about
the
response
of
communities
in
deep-sea
sediments
where
low
oxygen
levels
may
hinder
such
a
response
Here
we
examined
the
hypothesis
that
increased
hydrocarbon
exposure
results
in
an
altered
sediment
microbial
community
structure
that
reflects
the
prospects
for
oil
biodegradation
under
the
prevailing
conditions
We
explore
this
hypothesis
using
metagenomic
analysis
and
metabolite
profiling
of
deep-sea
sediment
samples
following
the
DWH
oil
spill
The
presence
of
aerobic
microbial
communities
and
associated
functional
genes
was
consistent
among
all
samples
whereas
a
greater
number
of
Deltaproteobacteria
and
anaerobic
functional
genes
were
found
in
sediments
closest
to
the
DWH
blowout
site
Metabolite
profiling
also
revealed
a
greater
number
of
putative
metabolites
in
sediments
surrounding
the
blowout
zone
relative
to
a
background
site
located
127
km
away
The
mass
spectral
analysis
of
the
putative
metabolites
revealed
that
alkylsuccinates
remained
below
detection
levels
but
a
homologous
series
of
benzylsuccinates
with
carbon
chain
lengths
from
5
to
10
could
be
detected
Our
findings
suggest
that
increased
exposure
to
hydrocarbons
enriches
for
Deltaproteobacteria
which
are
known
to
be
capable
of
anaerobic
hydrocarbon
metabolism
We
also
provide
evidence
for
an
active
microbial
community

aromatic
hydrocarbons
in
deep-sea
sediments

As

been
suggested
that
the

little
is
known
about
the
microbial
capacity
for
oil-degradation
within
deep-sea
sediment
communities
under
the
circumstances
presented
by
the
DWH
spill
including
the
extreme
depth
~1500
m
and
the
sudden
hydrocarbon
exposure
To
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
sediment-associated
microbial
response
to
the
DWH
oil
spill
deep-sea

the
area
surrounding
the
DWH
oil
spill
between
September
19
and
October

2010
Preliminary
chemical
analysis
revealed
that
the
cores
closest
to
the
DWH
spill
contained
high
levels
of
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons

to

Although
it
is
likely
that
the
DWH
oil
spill
contributed
to
the
higher
PAH
levels
observed
other
sources
that
could
have
influenced
these
levels
include
natural
seeps
located
near
the
DWH
site
and
drilling
fluids
In
this
study
we
hypothesized
that
increased
hydrocarbon
exposure
results
in
the
alteration
of
microbial
community
structure
such
that
it
reflects
the
selection
for
organisms
capable
of
the
anaerobic
metabolism
of
petroleum
constituents
We
performed
metagenomic
sequencing
on
three
of
the
deep-sea
sediment
samples
collected
by

To
complement
the
metagenomic
analysis
metabolic
profiling
was
used
to
detect
homologous
series
of
putative
signature
metabolites
associated
with
anaerobic
hydrocarbon
biodegradation
Our
data
indicated
significant
differences
among
the
microbial
communities
examined
in
this
study
compared
to
those
detected
prior
to
the
DWH
oil
spill
Moreover
the
metabolite
profiling
revealed
significantly
more
putative
metabolites
in
the
two
samples
closest
to
the
DWH
site
relative
to
the
more
distant
background
site
These
findings
were
consistent
with
the
metagenomic
data
showing
an
increase
in
the
number
of
functional
genes
associated
with

DISCUSSION
In
this
study
we
present
three
new
metagenomic
data
sets
from
deep-sea
sediments
of
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
following
the
DWH
oil
spill
Due
to
logistical
and
political
circumstances
surrounding
the
DWH
oil
spill
three
samples
were
the
extent
of
which
we
were
able
to
obtain
These
data
however
present
a
unique
opportunity
to
examine
deep-sea
sediments
following
a
massive
anthropogenic
hydrocarbon
loading
event
and
triples
the
number
of
metagenomic
datasets
previously
available
one
metagenome
Biddle
et
al.
2011
for
deep-sea
subsurface
sediments
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
Although
the
lack
of
replication
makes
it
difficult
to
draw
wide
conclusions
regarding
the
effects
of
hydrocarbon
exposure
on
microbial
community
composition
and
activity
these
metagenomes
provide
important
data
to
make
baseline
observations
that
will
need
to
be
examined
more
thoroughly
in
future
studies
Two
previous
deep-sea
metagenomic
studies
resulted
in
the
suggestion
that
there
is
a
core
metagenomic
structure
for
deep-sea
sediments
composed
of
four
main
microbial
groups
Euryarchaeota
Proteobacteria
Firmicutes
and
Chloroflexi
that
can
vary
depending
on
specific
parameters
such
as
depth
organic
carbon
content
and
geography
Biddle
et
al.
2008
Biddle
et
al.
2011
These
four
microbial
taxa
were
also
detected
in
GoM
sediment
samples
in
the
present
work
however
they
do
not
constitute
the
four
major
groups
detected
in
this
report
Proteobacteria
Bacteroidetes
Firmicutes
and
Actinobacteria
Despite
similarities
to
the
microbial
communities
described
previously
Biddle
et
al.
2008
Biddle
et
al.
2011
our
cross-study
comparisons
via
hierarchical
clustering
and
principal
component
analyses
reveal
a
distinct
separation
between
the
Peru
Margin
communities
Biddle
et
al.
2008
and
both
Gulf
of
Mexico
communities
Biddle
et
al.
2011
and
current
report
This
is
of
particular
interest
since
the
two
previous
studies
were
subsurface
samples
compared
to
our
surficial
samples
A
metagenomic
fosmid
library
of
deep-sea
sediments
from
the
organic-rich
Qiongdongnan
Basin
in
the
South
China
Sea
Hu
et
al.
2010
revealed
a
community
structure
that
was
more
similar
to
this
study
than
to
those
of
the
Biddle
et
al
2008
2011
studies
These
data
suggest
the
possibility
that
organic
carbon
content
is
more
relevant
to
microbial
community
structure
than
geography
Hu
et
al
2010
detected
Proteobacteria
as
the
dominant
~43
bacterial
phylum
and
Deltaproteobacteria
as
the
most
abundant
class
within
this
phylum
KEGG
analysis
of
the
fosmid
ends
also
revealed
genes
associated
with
the
biodegradation
pathways
of
numerous
xenobiotics
including
but
not
limited
to
dichloroethane
benzoate
biphenyl
ethylbenzene
fluorene
naphthalene
anthracene
styrene
tetrachloroethene
and
gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane
The
detection
of
genes
related
to
the
biodegradation
of
xenobiotic
compounds
in
their
study
and
ours
supports
the
premise
that
deep-sea
sediment
microbial
communities
have
the
potential
to
metabolize
a
diverse
array
of
organic
compounds
including
many
that
are
found
in
oil
Numerous
bacterial
species
have
evolved
the
ability
to
metabolize
aliphatic
e.g.
alkanes
and
alkenes
and
aromatic
hydrocarbons
e.g.
mono-
and
polynuclear
with
the
most
rapid
and
complete
degradation
achieved
through
aerobic
processes
Fritsche
and
Hofrichter
2008
The
majority
of
characterized
oil-degraders
within
marine
systems
are
aerobic
members
of
the
Alpha-
and
Gammaproteobacteria

to
be

i.e.
more
than

of
the
sequences
were
classified
as
Oceanospirillales
predominantly
from
one
monophylectic
lineage
Hazen
et

2010
Our
metagenomic
analysis
revealed
the
presence
in
all
three
deep-sea
sediment
libraries
of
bacteria
belonging
to
the
broader
Oceanospirillales
order
including
51–61
sequences
specifically
recruited
to
the
Alcanivorax
borkumensis
genome
in
each
sample
Figure

was

2010
Mason
et

2012
GoM315
GoM278
and
GoM023
exhibited
similar
levels
of
Oceanospirillales
spp

1.7
and
1.4
of
bacterial
sequences
respectively
and
Gammaproteobacteria

and
19
of
bacterial
sequences
respectively
showing
no
correlation
to
the
hydrocarbon
levels
associated
with
each
sample
Alphaproteobacteria
associated
with
aerobic
oil-degradation
were
also
found
at
very
low
abundances
with
similar
levels
across
the
deep-sea
sediment
samples
including
Roseovarius
spp
and
Maricaulis
spp
0.5
and
0.3
of
bacterial
species
respectively
Nonetheless
mono-
and
dioxygenases
were
present
in
all
three
samples
These
data
indicate
that
the
potential
for
aerobic
degradation
is
present
in
these
samples
albeit
at
much
lower
levels
than
observed
in
the
water
column
Hazen
et
al.
2010
Mason
et
al.
2012
and
that
the
level
of
hydrocarbon
exposure
did
not
significantly
impact
this
potential
One
potential
explanation
for
this
is
that
the
hydrocarbons
susceptible
to
aerobic
degradation
were
depleted
rapidly
in
the
water
column
either
by
dispersants
or
by
the
quick
responding
bacterial
blooms
of
aerobic
hydrocarbon-degrading
microorganisms
Hazen
et
al.
2010
Kessler
et
al.
2011
As
a
result
the
hydrocarbon
loading
that
occurred
in
the
deep-sea
sediments
may
not
have
promoted
the
growth
of
microorganisms
capable
of
aerobic
hydrocarbon
degradation
but
rather
that
of
microorganisms
capable
of
degrading
the
remaining
recalcitrant
hydrocarbons
that
require
anaerobic
processing
It
is
also
possible
however
that
we
sampled
at
a
time
when
the
community
was
just
beginning
to
shift
to
reflect
the
increasing
importance
of
anaerobic
microbes
Future
work
involving
time
series
samples
and/or
the
analysis
of
aerobic
metabolites
will
be
necessary
to
provide
further
insights
Anaerobic
biodegradation
of

is
an
important

Studies
during
the
last
two
decades
have
highlighted
the
ability
of
anaerobic
microorganisms
to
metabolize
a
variety
of
hydrocarbons
including
n-alkanes
n-alkenes
alicyclic
hydrocarbons

To
date
the
most
well-characterized
anaerobic
mechanism
for
hydrocarbon
activation
and
degradation
is
via
addition
of
the
hydrocarbon
to
the
double
bond
of
fumarate
“
fumarate
addition
”

Deltaproteobacteria
in
particular
have
been
implicated
in
“
fumarate
addition
”
of
both
aromatic
and
aliphatic
hydrocarbons
Widdel
et
al.
2010
In
this
study
metagenomic
analysis
revealed
an
increase
in
the
percentage
of
bacterial
sequences
that
represent
Deltaproteobacteria
associated
with
the
sediment
cores
closest
to
the
DWH
well
where
there
were
higher
levels
of
PAHs
Operational
Science
Advisory
Team
2010
and
detectable
levels
of
alkanes
and
alkenes
It
should
be
noted
that
the
increase
in
Deltaproteobacteria
is
potentially
an
indirect
effect
of
the
increased
dead
biomass
from
the
oil
spill
which
can
not
be
ruled
out
by
this
study
In
any
case
recruitment
plots
demonstrated
that
857
and
547
of
the
metagenomic
sequences
mapped
onto
the
Deltaproteobacterial
genomes
of
Desulfatibacillum
alkenivorans
AK-01
and
G.
metallireducens
GS-15
respectively
The
increases
in
Deltaproteobacteria
were
also
concurrent
with
an
increase
in
functional
genes
involved
in
the
anaerobic
degradation
of
hydrocarbons
such
as
BSS
acetyl-CoA
acetyltransferase
and
benzoyl-CoA
reductase
These
results
suggest
that
the
microbial
response
to
anthropogenic
hydrocarbon
loading
may
mirror
aspects
of
microbial
communities
associated
with
Gulf
of
Mexico
natural
seeps
where
Deltaproteobacteria
play
a
dominant
role
in
their
biogeochemical
activity
including
anaerobic
hydrocarbon
degradation
Lloyd
et
al.
2010
Orcutt
et
al.
2010
Most
likely
however
the
specific
genus-level
lineages
of
Deltaproteobacteria
will
be
dependent
on
the
hydrocarbon
source
present
since
the
natural
gas-rich
seeps
contain
specialized
deltaproteobacterial
groups
for
anaerobic
methane
utilization
that
are
unlikely
to
thrive
in
sediments
with
more
recalcitrant
oil
remnants
Clone
libraries
of
assA
and
bssA
supported
the
metagenomic
analysis
Both
genotypes
were
detected
in
sediments
near
the
DWH
well
GoM278
and
GoM315
but
not
at
the
unimpacted
site
GoM023
The
presence
of
assA
and
bssA
suggests
the
potential
for
both
aliphatic
and
aromatic
hydrocarbon
activation
via
“
fumarate
addition.
”
Although
assA
genotypes
were
detected
in
sediments
from
GoM278
and
GoM315
alkylsuccinates
were
not
detected
in
these
samples
However
this
should
not
be
interpreted
as
conclusive
evidence
that
aliphatic
substrates
were
not
being
metabolized
The
requisite
metabolites
are
usually
in
low
abundance
typically
nM
and
transitory
and
could
have
easily
been
further
metabolized
or
been
below
method
detection
limits
The
alkanoic
acid
compounds
detected
in
the
GoM
samples
could
have
been
formed
via
multiple
biological
pathways
including
aerobic
and
anaerobic
transformation
of
aliphatic
hydrocarbons
but
they
are
not
highly
diagnostic
Despite
the
non-detection
of
alkylsuccinates
both
bssA
genotypes
and
the
putative
benzylsuccinate
metabolites
were
detected
in
the
two
sediment
cores
closest
to
the
spill
site
suggesting
in
situ
anaerobic
biodegradation
of
alkylbenzenes
This
is
consistent
with
the
increased
number
of
genes
related
to
“
aromatic
metabolism
”
detected
in
the
corresponding
sediments
via
metagenomic
analysis
Benzoate
was
also
detected
in
GoM278
and
GoM315
sediments
suggesting
further
transformation
of
the
benzylsuccinate
derivatives
of
monoaromatic
hydrocarbons
Beller
and
Spormann
1997
Leuthner
et
al.
1998
However
benzoate
can
be
formed
during
the
metabolism
of
a
wide
variety
of
aromatic
compounds
under
aerobic
and
anaerobic
conditions
Overall
this
study
took
an
interdisciplinary
approach
of
investigating
the
phylogenetic
composition
and
functional
potential
of
Gulf
of
Mexico
deep-sea
sediment
communities
following
the
DWH
oil
spill
Based
on
metagenomic
analyses
functional
gene
clone
libraries
and
metabolite
profiling
the
data
herein
suggest
that
the
presence
of
PAHs
alkanes
and
alkenes
may
influence
the
microbial
community
through
the
enrichment
of
Deltaproteobacteria
capable
of
anaerobic
hydrocarbon
metabolism
This
evidence
suggests
that
the
microbial
communities
exposed
to
anthropogenic
hydrocarbon
loading
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
deep-sea
sediments
likely
impacted
the
bioremediation
of
the
DWH
oil
spill
through
anaerobic
degradation
which
has
been
previously
overlooked

to
deduce
the
fate
of
the

Abstract
The
Deepwater
Horizon
oil
spill
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
is
the
deepest
and
largest
offshore
spill
in
the
United
State
history
and
its
impacts
on
marine
ecosystems
are
largely
unknown
Here
we
showed
that
the
microbial
community
functional
composition
and
structure
were
dramatically
altered
in
a
deep-sea
oil
plume
resulting
from

Introduction
On
20
April
2010
a
massive
oil
leak
occurred
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
's
Mississippi
Canyon
area
at
a
depth
of
1544
m
releasing
4.9
million
barrels
of
crude
oil
into
the
deep
ocean
before
the
wellhead
was
finally
capped
on
15

2010

Chemical
dispersants
including
COREXIT
EC9500A
and
COREXIT

were
used
on
site
at
one
of
the
highest
rates
in
history
to
accelerate
oil
dispersal
A
deep-water
oil
plume
was
initially
detected
at
a
depth
of
1000–1200
m
below
the
surface

but
at

could
no
longer
be
detected
presumably
as
a
result
of

and

Significant
environmental
differences
in
the
deep
sea
of
Gulf
of
Mexico
from
other
historic
offshore
oil
spills
present
an
urgent
need
to
better
understand
the
fate
and
impacts
of
the
oil
on
this
specific
habitat
In
marine
ecosystems
microorganisms
are
known
to
have
predominant
roles
in
degradation
of
oil
contaminants
Therefore
it
was
expected
that
the
indigenous
microbial
communities
would
have
a
significant
role
in
degradation
of
the
deep
oil
plume
This
hypothesis
was
supported
by
two
recent
studies
that
explored
the
microbial
and
chemical
properties
of
samples
collected
from
the
deep
oil
plume
Camilli
et
al
2010
Hazen
et
al
2010
Hazen
et
al
2010
used
a
combination
of
molecular
chemical
and
physiological
approaches
to
investigate
the
microbial
and
chemical
composition
in
the
deep-sea
plume
compared
with
uncontaminated
water
from
the
same
depth
outside
the
plume
They
demonstrated
that
the
oil
depletion
was
due
to
a
combination
of
mixing
dispersion
and
biodegradation
by
microbes
residing
in
the
deep
sea
Hazen
et
al

In
this
study
samples
from
the
deep-sea
plume

referred
to
as

that
were
not
contaminated
with

were
analyzed
with
a
functional
gene
microarray
the
GeoChip
4.0
Hazen
et
al
2010
to
address
the
following
questions
i
How
did
the
oil
contamination
affect
the
marine
microbial
community
functional
composition
and
structure
ii
How
did
different
microbial
functional
genes
involved
in
key
microbial
processes
shift
in
response
to
the
oil
spill
iii
Were
functional
genes
specific
to
hydrocarbon
HC
degradation
processes
enriched
in
the
oil
plume
Our
results
indicated
that
the
oil
spill
dramatically
altered
microbial
community
functional
structure
the
marine
microbial
communities
present
were
metabolically
diverse
and
that
these
communities
were
able
to
respond
to
the
oil

Discussion
The
Deepwater
Horizon
oil
spill
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
was
one
of
the
worst
environmental
disasters
in
the
United
State
history
The
impact
of
an
oil
spill
of
such
an
unprecedented
magnitude
and
depth
on
marine
ecosystems
is
largely
unknown
Using
the
GeoChip-based
high-throughput
microarray
technology
we
showed
that
diverse
microbial
functional
groups
a
group
of
genes
involved
in
certain
functional
processes
including
those
important
to
HC
degradation
carbon
metabolism
methanogenesis
nitrogen
assimilation
sulfate
reduction
phosphorus
release
metal
resistance
and
bacteriophage
replication
were
more
highly
represented
in
the
oil
plume
samples
than
in
non-plume
samples
from
the
same
depth
Also
the
changes
in
community
functional
structure
were
highly
correlated
to
the
changes
in
geochemistry
with
oil
being
the
predominant
factor
shaping
the
functional
composition
and
structure
of
the
microbial
communities
Our
results
support
the
phylogeny-based
study
by
Hazen
et
al
2010
that
the
deep-sea
marine
microbial
communities
underwent
a
dynamic
change
in
response
to
the
oil
spill
and
associated
geochemical
changes
Our
results
are
also
consistent
with
previous
studies
of
oil
spill
and
petroleum
contamination
Harayama
et
al
2004
Head
et
al
2006
Bordenave
et
al
2007
which
showed
that
microorganisms
able
to
utilize
HCs
became
dominant
in
oil-contaminated
sites
Such
functional
gene
information
is
useful
for
assessing
the
impacts
of
oil
spills
and
should
facilitate
the
design
of
appropriate
strategies
and
approaches
to
deal
with
petroleum
contamination
The
clean-up
of
the
deep-sea
oil
plume
will
primarily
depend
on
the
indigenous
microbes
present
in
this
environment
as
current
technology
does
not
allow
removing
the
dispersed
oil
and
gas
at
such
great
depths
One
of
the
critical
environmental
questions
is
whether
microorganisms
for
degrading
various
HCs
exist
in
the
community
and
whether
they
respond
to
oil
spill
Our
GeoChip
results
indicated
that
many
functional
genes/populations
involved
in
both
aerobic
and
anaerobic
degradation
of
various
oil
components
are
detected
and/or
enriched
in
the
oil
plume
indicating
that
the
indigenous
HC-degrading
populations
are
capable
of
responding
to
the
oil
spill
For
example
alkB
for
alkanes
Xamo
for
alkene
genes
bco
ohbAB
GCoADH
and
pimF
for
benzoate
genes

mdlB
and
mdlC
for
mandelate
and
genes
Apc
and
catB
for
BTEX
metabolic
pathway
exhibited
a
significantly
P
0.05
higher
abundance
in
the
oil
plume
than
in
the
non-oil
plume
The
changes
in
relative
abundance
of
these
genes/populations
were
significantly
correlated
with
the
concentrations
of
various
oil
contaminants
in
the
samples
Hazen
et
al
2010
Especially
several
genes
for
PAH
degradation
were
enriched
in
the
oil
plume
samples
which
could
be
important
in
determining
the
long-term
effects
of
the
oil
spill
on
the
marine
ecosystems
Also

representative
of

Oceanospirillales
appeared
to
have
significantly
higher
P
0.01
abundance
in
the
plume

than
in

samples
although
the
dominance
of
the
Oceanospirillum
population
consuming
the
oil
in
the

was
based
on

and

of

genes

have
most
likely
occured

In
this
study
pmoA
and
mmoX
genes
for
aerobic
methane

did
not
show
a
statistically
significant
change
though
their
abundance
was
higher
in
plume
samples
than
in
non-plume
samples
There
are
two
possible
explanations
for
this
one
is
that
the
aerobic
methane
oxidation
was
inhibited
owing
to
the
presence
of
easier
to
degrade
alkanes
in
the
deep
sea
and
the
other
is
that
the
methane
gas
was
moved
up
to
the
surface
more
directly
and
did
not
accumulate
in
the
deep
oil
plume
Also
unlike
propane
methane
may
form
gas
hydrates
at
the
deep
plume
temperature
and
pressure
making
it
unavailable
to
microorganisms

significantly

higher
signal
intensities
were
observed
for

in
the

than
non-plume
samples
indicating
that
those
enriched
mcrA
genes
derived
from
methanogens
likely
link
to
HC
degradation
rather
than
plume
methane
release

involved
in

methane

however
remain
unclear
thus
we
could
not
detect
this
functional
process
In
this
study
many
functional
genes
were
detected
in
the
uncontaminated
samples
that
were
not
detected
in
the

These
results
suggest
that
oil
spills
can
select
against
those
populations
containing
these
genes
or
that
specific
members
of
the
community
have
a
selective
advantage
if
they
are
capable
of
HC
degradation
and
these
grow
to
represent
a
greater
proportion
of
the
functional
gene
repertoire
In
conclusion
our
results
indicate
that
a
variety
of
HC-degrading
functional
genes
were
enriched
in
response
to
oil
contamination
and
associated
environmental
changes
Our
results
also
imply
that
there
is
a
great
potential
for
in

bioremediation
of
oil
contaminants
in
the
deep-seawater
ecosystem
and
such
oil-degrading
populations
and
associated
microbial
communities
may
have
a
significant
role
in
determining
the
ultimate

Anaerobic
Degradation
of
Methyl
tert-Butyl
Ether
MTBE
and
tert-Butyl
Alcohol
TBA
Abstract
The
potential
for
anaerobic
degradation
of
methyl
tert-butyl
ether
MTBE
and
tert-butyl
alcohol
TBA
was
investigated
in
laboratory
incubations
of
sediments
from
a
petroleum-contaminated
aquifer
and
in
aquatic
sediments
The
addition
of
humic
substances
HS
stimulated
the
anaerobic
degradation
of
MTBE
in
aquifer
sediments
in
which
Fe
III
was
available
as
an
electron
acceptor
This
is
attributed
to
the
fact
that
HS
and
other
extracellular
quinones
can
stimulate
the
activity
of
Fe
III
-reducing
microorganisms
by
acting
as
an
electron
shuttle
between
Fe
III
-reducing
microorganisms
and
insoluble
Fe
III
oxides
MTBE
was
not
degraded
in
aquifer
sediments
without
Fe
III
and
HS
14C
-MTBE
added
to
aquatic
sediments
adapted
for
anaerobic
MTBE
degradation
was
converted
to
14CO2
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
HS
or
the
HS
analog
anthraquione-2,6-disulfonate
Unamended
aquatic
sediments
produced
14CH4
as
well
as
14CO2
from
14C
-MTBE
The
aquatic
sediments
also
rapidly
consumed
TBA
under
anaerobic
conditions
and
converted
14C
-TBA
to
14CH4
and
14CO2
An
adaptation
period
of
ca
250−300
days
was
required
prior
to
the
most
rapid
anaerobic
MTBE
degradation
in
both
sediment
types
whereas
TBA
was
metabolized
in
the
aquatic
sediments
without
a
lag
These
results
demonstrate
that
under
the
appropriate
conditions
MTBE
and
TBA
can
be
degraded
in
the
absence
of
oxygen
This
suggests
that
it
may
be
possible
to
design
strategies
for
the
anaerobic
remediation
of
MTBE
in
petroleum-contaminated
subsurface
environments
Introduction
The
gasoline
additive
methyl
tert-butyl
ether
MTBE
is
a
ubiquitous
groundwater
contaminant
1
The
U.S.
Geological
Survey
National
Water
Quality
Assessment
Program
identified
MTBE
in
27
of
urban
wells
tested
2
A
more
recent
survey
indicated
that
between
5
and
10
of
all
community
drinking
water
wells
nationwide
have
detectable
MTBE
contamination
3
MTBE
is
mobile
in
the
subsurface
in
part
because
it
is
highly
water
soluble
and
does
not
significantly
adsorb
to
aquifer
sediments
4
Although
the
potential
for
significant
aerobic
degradation
of
MTBE
has
been
observed
in
incuba
tions
of
aquatic
sediments
5
as
well
as
a
variety
of
pure
cultures
6-10
there
appears
to
be
little
intrinsic
potential
for
MTBE
degradation
in
aquifer
sediments
11
Thus
plumes
of
MTBE
can
be
much
more
extensive
than
the
plumes
of
other
petroleum
co-contaminants
11
12
The
persistence
of
MTBE
in
petroleum-contaminated
aquifers
has
led
to
a
search
for
methods
for
MTBE
bioremediation
Two
aerobic
MTBE-degrading
microorganisms
have
been
isolated
which
can
degrade
MTBE
when
introduced
into
aquifer
sediments
in
laboratory
incubations
9
10
Furthermore
there
was
a
loss
of
MTBE
from
an
oxygen-supplemented
portion
of
a
petroleum-contaminated
aquifer
that
was
inoculated
with
high
concentrations
of
a
MTBE-degrading
culture
12
It
has
been
suggested
that
aerobic
microorganisms
that
co-metabolize
MTBE
when
growing
on
propane
or
butane
might
be
used
for
either
in
situ
remediation
or
to
treat
MTBE
contamination
in
above-ground
bioreactors
6
7
Studies
on
aromatic
hydrocarbon
contaminants
have
suggested
that
anaerobic
strategies
for
the
in
situ
bioremediation
of
petroleum-contaminated
subsurface
environments
may
be
as
preferable
as
aerobic
approaches
13−23
The
source
zone
of
petroleum-contaminated
aquifers
is
invariably
anaerobic
19
Introducing
sufficient
oxygen
into
these
source
zones
can
be
technically
difficult
and
expensive
14
Anaerobic
electron
acceptors
can
be
easily
added
to
the
subsurface
and
they
do
not
react
with
other
compounds
present
20
These
past
studies
serve
as
a
basis
from
which
to
develop
a
potential
strategy
for
anaerobic
MTBE
biodegradation
Fe
III
is
frequently
the
most
abundant
potential
electron
acceptor
for
the
anaerobic
oxidation
of
organic
contaminants
in
polluted
subsurface
environments
19
Previous
studies
have
demonstrated
that
the
anaerobic
degradation
of
aromatic
hydrocarbons
including
benzene
can
be
stimulated
in
the
Fe
III
-containing
sediments
of
petroleum-contaminated
aquifers
with
the
addition
of
humic
substances
HS
HS
are
considered
to
promote
the
activity
of
Fe
III
-reducing
microorganisms
by
alleviating
the
need
for
direct
contact
between
Fe
III
oxides
and
Fe
III
-reducing
microorganisms
24
HS
contain
quinone
moieties
which
Fe
III
-reducing
microorganisms
can
use
as
electron
acceptors
for
the
oxidation
of
organic
compounds
25−27
The
hydroquinone
moieties
produced
as
the
result
of
electron
transfer
to
HS
can
abiotically
reduce
Fe
III
oxides
producing
Fe
II
and
regenerating
oxidized
HS
that
can
again
serve
as
an
electron
acceptor
in
the
metabolism
of
Fe
III
-reducing
microorgan
isms
27
Thus
even
at
very
low
concentrations
HS
or
other
extracellular
quinones
can
significantly
accelerate
the
rate
of
Fe
III
oxide
reduction
in
aquifer
sediments
via
this
electron
shuttling
mechanism
28
There
appears
to
have
been
little
investigation
of
the
potential
for
anaerobic
MTBE
degradation
Thermodynamic
calculations
suggest
that
anaerobic
oxidation
of
MTBE
is
possible
with
each
of
the
most
prevalent
electron
acceptors
known
to
support
anaerobic
respiration
in
sedimentary
environments
Table
1
A
recent
EPA
study
indicates
that
MTBE
may
be
removed
from
groundwater
under
methanogenic
conditions
29
However
the
few
studies
that
have
been
carried
out
under
controlled
anaerobic
conditions
suggest
that
MTBE
is
only
slowly
degraded
if
at
all
in
the
absence
of
oxygen
For
example
in
anaerobic
MTBE-contaminated
aquifer
sediments
ca
3
of
the
added
14C
-MTBE
was
converted
to
14CO2
in
seven
months
11
A
similar
study
with
aquatic
sediments
found
no
anaerobic
oxidation
of
14C
-MTBE
5
When
freshwater
sediments
were
amended
with
MTBE
and
incubated
under
anaerobic
conditions
MTBE
persisted
in
most
of
the
sediments
evaluated
with
the
exception
of
one
bottle
of
sediment
in
which
there
was
evidence
for
the
conversion
of
some
of
the
MTBE
to
tert-butyl
alcohol
TBA
which
was
not
further
degraded
30
31
In
another
study
MTBE
persisted
in
most
water-saturated
soils
but
was
slowly
degraded
in
one
soil
amended
with
starch
and
nutrients
that
was
assumed
to
be
methanogenic
32
but
it
was
not
clear
that
the
loss
of
MTBE
that
was
observed
could

attributed

In
order
to

more
about
the
potential
for
anaerobic

of
MTBE
MTBE
degradation
was
investigated
in
anaerobic
sediments
from
a
MTBE-contaminated
aquifer
in
which
rates
of
MTBE
degradation
were
previously
reported
to
be
slow
11
as
well
as
in
aquatic
sediments
which
previous
studies
have
demonstrated
can
anaerobically
degrade
relatively
recalcitrant

This
is
a

Freshwater
aquatic

were
collected
from
the
Potomac
River
at
the
previously
described
location
35
by
using
an
Eckman

These
sediments
had
previously
been

All
sediments
were
placed
in
sealed
anaerobic
containers
and
shipped
overnight
to
be
processed
The
sediments
were
homogenized
in
a

glovebag
and
dispensed
into
the
appropriate
serum

Upon
removal
from
the
glovebag
the
headspace

Results
The
potential
for
anaerobic
MTBE
degradation
was
first
evaluated
in
the
aquifer
sediments
No
14C
-MTBE
was
available
for
these
studies
so
MTBE
degradation
was
monitored
by
measuring
the
loss
of
MTBE
over
time
There
was
no
loss
of
MTBE
over
275
days
in
sediments
that
received
no
amendments
or
in
sediments
amended
with
only

However
in
one
of
the
three
bottles
amended
with
HS
and
Fe

the
MTBE
was
depleted
below
the
detection
limit
1
mg/L
during
this
time
When
MTBE
ca
50
mg/L
was
added
back
to
the
sediments
it
was
consumed
without
a
lag

MTBE
was
added
back
with
repeated
consumption
of
the
MTBE
until
after
180
days
when
MTBE
consumption
stopped
By
this
time
the

were
very
dark
compared
to
the
reddish-brown

when
the
Fe

was

added
suggesting
that
most
of
the

had
been
reduced

The
potential
for

of
MTBE
as
well
as
TBA
was
evaluated
in
freshwater
aquatic
sediments
from
the

When
freshly
collected
sediments
were
amended
with
2-14C

both
14CH4
and
14CO2
were
produced
over
time
When
molybdate
was
added
to
inhibit
sulfate
reduction
in
the
sediments
the
rate
of
14CO2

tion
was
diminished
with
an
increase
in
the
production
of
14CH4
but
there
was
still
significant
14CO2
production
The
sediments
contained
ca
10.8
μmol
of
HCl-extractable
Fe

and
ca
85
μmol
of

Discussion
The
results
demonstrate
that
MTBE
and
TBA
can
be
degraded
in
anaerobic
sediments
After
an
adaptation
period
MTBE
was
actively
consumed
in
aquifer
sediments
in
which
the
activity
of
Fe
III
-reducing
microorganisms
was
stimulated
with
the
addition
of
HS
The
aquatic
sediments
had
an
intrinsic
capacity
to
degrade
MTBE
without
the
need
for
amendments
The
initial
concentration
of
MTBE
that
was
used
in
this
study
50
mg/L
is
comparable
to
concentrations
likely
to
be
found
in
the
anaerobic
source
zones
of
petroleum-contaminated
aquifers
11
These
results
suggest
that
it
may
be
possible
to
develop
anaerobic
strategies
for
MTBE
bioremediation
within
the
source
zone
of
petroleum-contaminated
aquifers
Anaerobic
Degradation
of
MTBE
Previous
reports
of
MTBE
degradation
in
aquifer
sediment
11
30
or
soils
32
or
aquatic
sediments
5
31
have
suggested
that
MTBE
is
not
readily
degraded
under
in
situ
anaerobic
conditions
In
a
similar
manner
the
aquifer
sediments
evaluated
in
this
study
also
had
little
intrinsic
potential
to
degrade
MTBE
MTBE
was
only
rapidly
degraded
in
the
aquifer
sediments
when
HS
were
added
and
when
Fe
III
concentrations
were
maintained
at
high
levels
Based
on
previous
studies
of
the
oxidation
of
organic
matter
coupled
to
Fe
III
oxide
reduction
in
the
presence
of
HS

36
the
degradation
of
MTBE
in
the
presence
of
added
HS
and
Fe
III
is
assumed
to
result
from
Fe
III
-reducing
microorganisms
oxidizing
MTBE
with
the
transfer
of
electrons
to
HS
Once
reduced
the
HS
can
abiotically
transfer
electrons
to
the
Fe
III
This
regenerates
the
HS
to
the
oxidized
form
Thus
HS
promote
electron
shuttling
to
Fe
III
in
a
catalytic
manner
and
small
amounts
of
HS
can
continue
to
promote
Fe
III
reduction
through
multiple
reduction
and
oxidation
cycles
Studies
with
laboratory
cultures
have
demonstrated
the
potential
for
HS
to
serve
as
an
electron
shuttle
to
Fe
III
oxides
in
this
manner
25
27
37
It
has
also
previously
been
demonstrated
that
the
addition
of
HS
or
the
HS
analog
AQDS
can
stimulate
the
reduction
of
Fe
III
in
sediments
28
38
accompanied
by
the
growth
of
Fe
III
-reducing
microorganisms
39
This
strategy
has
been
used
to
promote
degradation
of
other
recalcitrant
compounds
21
36
40
The
studies
with
the
aquatic
sediments
provided
preliminary
evidence
that
anaerobic
MTBE
degradation
coupled
to
the
reduction
of
a
variety
of
electron
acceptors
may
be
possible
In
the
absence
of
other
amendments
14C
-MTBE
was
converted
to
14CO2
and
14CH4
The
addition
of
Fe
III
with
or
without
HS
or
AQDS
inhibited
the
production
of
14CH4
presumably
the
result
of
Fe
III
-reducing
microorgan
isms
outcompeting
methanogenic
microorganisms
for
electron
donors
41
Although
the
highest
rates
of
MTBE
oxidation
were
observed
in
some
of
the
sediment
samples
amended
with
HS
or
AQDS
the
high
variability
in
the
rate
of
MTBE
oxidation
within
the
different
treatments
made
it
impossible
to
determine
whether
the
addition
of
HS
significantly
stimulated
MTBE
oxidation
The
least
variability
was
seen
in
Fe
III
-only
amended
bottles
but
more
research
is
needed
to
determine
if
Fe
III
has
a
stimulatory
effect
on
MTBE
degradation
High
variability
in
the
rate
of
MTBE
degradation
in
replicate
samples
of
sediments
from
within
the
same
site
has
been
observed
previously
30
32
A
similar
phenomenon
was
reported
in
studies
in
which
benzene
degradation
was
stimulated
in
aquifer
sediments
with
Fe
III
chelators
23
The
reasons
for
this
variability
have
yet
to
be
investigated
in
detail
However
a
likely
explanation
is
that
the
populations
involved
in
the
degradation
of
the
contaminants
are
initially
very
small
In
this
case
heterogeneities
in
the
sediments
might
result
in
much
lower
numbers
of
the
appropriate
organisms
in
one
sample
rather
than
another
Thus
the
time
necessary
to
build
up
a
sufficiently
large
population
of
organisms
that
can
degrade
the
contaminants
may
vary
between
sediments
resulting
in
a
significant
difference
in
the
lag
period
prior
to
detectable
degradation
of
the
contaminant
Anaerobic
Degradation
of
TBA
An
additional
concern
resulting
from
contamination
of
groundwater
with
gasoline
amended
with
oxygenates
is
whether
TBA
will
be
degraded
TBA
may
be
a
product
of
MTBE
degradation
6
30
and/or
an
original
component
of
the
gasoline
42
Several
studies
have
concluded
that
TBA
is
only
slowly
degraded
or
persists
under
anaerobic
conditions
5
35
30
32
To
our
knowledge
the
results
presented
here
provide
the
first
indication
that
TBA
can
be
rapidly
degraded
under
strict
anaerobic
condi
tions
The
rates
of
TBA
degradation
reported
here
under
anaerobic
conditions
are
comparable
to
those
previously
reported
for
aerobic
degradation
in
TBA-adapted
sediments
5
14C
-TBA
was
converted
to
a
combination
of
14CH4
and
14CO2
If
TBA
was
converted
to
methane
and
carbon
dioxide
solely
according
to
the
reaction
then
it
would
be
expected
that
14CH4
and
14CO2
would
be
produced
in
a
ratio
of
3:1
However
the
results
with
2-14C
-acetate
suggested
that
methanogenesis
was
not
the
only
terminal
electron-accepting
process
taking
place
in
these
sediments
The
ratio
of
14CH4
to
14CO2
from
2-14C
-acetate
was
1:2
whereas
this
ratio
is
typically
4:1
in
sediments
in
which
methane
production
is
the
predominant
terminal
electron-accepting
process
The
actual
ratio
of
14CO2
to
14CH4
was
3:1
for
14C
-TBA
oxidation
Therefore
it
appears
that
as
with
acetate
TBA
was
being
converted
to
methane
and
carbon
dioxide
by
a
variety
of
terminal
electron-accepting
processes
Implications
for
MTBE
Remediation
There
is
increasing
reliance
on
natural
degradation
processes
to
remove
many
petroleum
contaminants
from
impacted
subsurface
environments
43
The
results
suggest
that
in
some
instances
anaerobic
microbial
communities
may
eventually
develop
which
can
degrade
MTBE
but
there
are
many
sites
at
which
this
has
not
happened
in
a
timely
manner
that
would
prevent
significant
spread
of
MTBE
Thus
methods
for
stimulating
MTBE
degradation
in
sediments
are
needed
This
study
suggests
that
in
some
instances
it
may
be
possible
to
stimulate
the
rate
of
anaerobic
MTBE
degradation
However
a
much
better
understanding
of
the
mechanisms
for
anaerobic
MTBE
degradation
will
be
required
before
it
will
be
possible
to
design
reliable
anaerobic
bioremediation
strate
gies
for
MTBE

Anaerobic
benzene
degradation
by
bacteria
Summary
Benzene
is
a
widespread
and
toxic
contaminant
The
fate
of
benzene
in
contaminated
aquifers
seems
to
be
primarily
controlled
by
the
abundance
of
oxygen
benzene
is
aerobically
degraded
at
high
rates
by
ubiquitous
microorganisms
and
the
oxygen-dependent
pathways
for
its
breakdown
were
elucidated
more
than
50
years
ago
In
contrast
benzene
was
thought
to
be
persistent
under
anoxic
conditions
until
25
years
ago
Nevertheless
within
the
last
15
years
several
benzene-degrading
cultures
have
been
enriched
under
varying
electron
acceptor
conditions
in
laboratories
around
the
world
and
organisms
involved
in
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
have
been
identified
indicating
that
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
is
a
relevant
environmental
process
However
only
a
few
benzene
degraders
have
been
isolated
in
pure
culture
so
far
and
they
all
use
nitrate
as
an
electron
acceptor
In
some
highly
enriched
strictly
anaerobic
cultures
benzene
has
been
described
to
be
mineralized
cooperatively
by
two
or
more
different
organisms
Despite
great
efforts
the
biochemical
mechanism
by
which
the
aromatic
ring
of
benzene
is
activated
in
the
absence
of
oxygen
is
still
not
fully
elucidated
methylation
hydroxylation
and
carboxylation
are

reactions
This
review
summarizes
the
current
knowledge
about
the
‘
key
players
’
of
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
under
different
electron

conditions
and
the

of
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
Introduction
Benzene
is
a
common
component
of
fuels
particularly
gasoline
and
an
important
raw
chemical
used
as
solvent
or
chemical
intermediate
Due
to
its
extensive
use
benzene
is
a
widespread
anthropogenic
contaminant
in
aqueous
environments
Compared
with
other
hydrocarbons
benzene
is
highly
water-soluble
saturation
24
mM
at
25°C
and
toxic
the
US
Environmental
Protection
Agency
has
classified
benzene
as
a
Group
A
human
carcinogen
Chemically
benzene
is
stable
under
typical
environmental
conditions
as
the
compound
is
stabilized
by
the
aromatic
ring
system
π-electron
system
without
any
potentially
reactive
substituent
The
persistence
of
benzene
in
aqueous
environments
seems
to
be
primarily
controlled
by
the
abundance
of
oxygen
as
benzene
is
often
persistent
under
anoxic
conditions
Aerobic
benzene-degrading
microorganisms
are
ubiquitous
and
have
been
known
for
a
long
time
–
the
first
report
in
regard
to
aerobic
benzene-degrading
microorganisms
dates
almost
100
years
back
Söhngen
1913
Benzene-degrading
organisms
contain
mono-
or
dioxygenases
which
activate
the
aromatic
nucleus
by
introducing
molecular
oxygen
to
yield
phenol
or
cis-benzene
dihydrodiol
compounds
that
are
further
oxidized
to
catechol
Gibson
and
Parales
2000
Tao
et
al.
2004
The
aromatic
ring
of
catechol
is
finally
cleaved
by
further
dioxygenases
in
ortho-
or
meta-position
Vaillancourt
et
al.
2006
Contaminant
plumes
in
aquifers
usually
become
anoxic
due
to
the
low
solubility
and
rapid
microbial
consumption
of
oxygen
Therefore
knowledge
about
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
is
highly
relevant
to
understand
the
fate
of
benzene
in
the
environment
Until
the
beginning
of
1980
aromatic
hydrocarbons
were
thought
to
be
generally
recalcitrant
under
anoxic
conditions
Atlas
1981
In
the
last
25
years
it
was
realized
that
many
hydrocarbons
including
aromatics
are
biodegradable
under
several
electron-accepting
conditions
for
a
review
see
Foght
2008
However
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
is
usually
slow
and
associated
with
long
lag-times
Benzene
is
considered
to
be
more
persistent
under
anoxic
conditions
than
its
alkylated
derivatives
toluene
ethylbenzene
and
xylene
isomers
and
the
reasons
for
the
recalcitrance
of
benzene
are
not
yet
clear
Co-contaminants
have
been
shown
to
inhibit
anaerobic
benzene
degradation

As
we
outline
in
this
review
benzene
can
be
degraded
by
syntrophic
consortia
which
may
require
narrow
and
specific
environmental
conditions
for
optimal
functioning
possibly
explaining
why
benzene
is
not
or
only
slowly
degraded
at
some
field
sites
or
in
laboratory
enrichment
cultures
The
number
of
laboratory
enrichment
cultures
capable
to
degrade
benzene
under
anoxic
conditions
has
increased
in
the
last
10
years
but
is
still
low
compared
with
the
number
of
cultures
described
for
anoxic
degradation
of
other
hydrocarbons
e.g
toluene
Notably
only
four
benzene-degrading
pure
cultures
were
described
and
all
of
them
use
nitrate
as
electron
acceptor
Coates
et
al.
2001
Kasai
et
al.
2006
Under
strictly
anoxic
conditions
pure
benzene-degrading
strains
have
been
not
yet
isolated
although
some
enrichment
cultures
seem
to
be
dominated
by
specific
organisms
The
lack
of
capable
laboratory
cultures
and
the
slow
growth
of
the
available
cultures
might
be
the
main
reasons
why
the
pathway
for
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
is
still
not
elucidated
This
review
summarizes
the
current
knowledge
about
the
organisms
involved
in
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
and
the
possible
mechanisms
by
which
the
benzene
ring
is
activated
and
transformed
in
the
absence
of

Benzene
degradation
in
laboratory
microcosms
–
electron
acceptors
and
‘
key
players
’
Benzene-mineralizing
laboratory
microcosms
have
been
established
under
several
electron-acceptor
conditions
in
most
cases
successful
enrichments
of
anaerobic
benzene
degraders
were
established
by
using
anoxic
sediment
or
soil
taken
from
petroleum
contaminated
sites
for
an
overview
see
Table

The

part
of

Correspondingly
microcosms
prepared
from
sediment
usually
show
higher
degradation
rates
and
shorter
lag-phases
compared
with
microcosms
prepared
from
groundwater
Holm
et
al.
1992
For
most
of
the
enrichment
cultures
however
long
lag-phases
sometimes
more
than
100
days
were
observed
before
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
was
detectable
Initial
degradation
rates
were
low
indicating
that
the
specific
rate
of
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
is
generally
rather
low
Nevertheless
long
lag-phases
and
low
degradation
rates
seem
to
be
not
the
only
reasons
for
the
limited
number
of
anaerobic
benzene-degrading
cultures
successfully
enriched
so
far
On
the
one
hand
several
authors
observed
that
anaerobic
benzene
degraders
could
not
be
detected
at
all
at
distinct
sites
e.g
Langenhoff
et
al.
1996
Kazumi
et
al.
1997
Nales
et
al.
1998
Weiner
and
Lovley
1998a
Phelps
and
Young
1999
indicating
that
anaerobic
benzene
degraders
may
not
be
ubiquitous
On
the
other
hand
it
has
been
shown
that
the
majority
of
bacteria
can
not
be
cultured
in
the
laboratory
yet
Rappe
and
Giovannoni
2003
Keller
and
Zengler
2004
These
yet
uncultured
organisms
might
include
anaerobic
benzene
degraders
Possibly
‘
not
detected
’
means
‘
beyond
the
detection
limit
’

set
up
anaerobic
enrichment
cultures
from
different
contaminated
sites
with
13C-labelled
benzene
as
substrate
and
observed
in
some
but
not
all
cultures
a
small

continuous
release
of
13C-CO2

that

Interestingly
the
growth
behaviour
of
benzene-degrading

seems
to
be
not
correlated
to
the
amount
of

available
by
the

The

This
is

as
the

for

The
first
demonstration
of
anaerobic
benzene
mineralization
was
reported
by
Grbic-Galic
and
Vogel
1987
who
detected
a
small
production
less
than
10
of
14C-CO2
from
ring-labelled
14C-benzene
in
a
methanogenic
culture
which
was
originally
prepared
from
sewage
sludge
and
pre-enriched
with
ferulic
acid
as
substrate
Complete

of

to

of

and

was
shown
later
in
microcosms
set
up
with
sediment
samples
taken
from
a
benzene-contaminated
aquifer

In
these

phylotypes
affiliated
to
the
genera
Desulfobacterium
and
Desulfosporosinus
as
well
as

were

as

members
of

Recently
a

identified
by

of
DNA
DNA-SIP

as
a
key

in
a
methanogenic
enrichment
culture
set
up
from

Sakai
et

The
archaeal
clone
library
constructed
from
this
enrichment
culture
was
dominated
by
phylotypes
belonging
to
the
Methanosarcinales
and
Methanomicrobiales
The
authors
concluded
that
benzene
was
sequentially
degraded
by
a
consortium
of
fermenters
aceticlastic
methanogens
and
hydrogenotrophic
methanogens
Such
syntrophic
relationships
likely
exist
in
all
benzene-degrading
cultures
under
methanogenic
conditions
as
methanogens
have
a
narrow
organic
substrate
spectrum
restricted
to
simple
low-molecular-weight
organic
compounds
and
are
not
known
for
degrading
aromatic
compounds
Thus
methanogens
are
assumed
to
consume
hydrogen
acetate
or
other
small
molecules
released
by
fermenting
organisms
Such
syntrophic
relationships
were
also
described
for
the
degradation
of
long-chain
alkanes
under
methanogenic
conditions

These

In
the
last
15
years
several
cultures
degrading
benzene
under
sulfate-reducing
conditions
were
enriched
and
the
dominant
organisms
were
described
The
marine
culture
enriched
by
Phelps
and
colleagues
1996
contained
12
different
phylotypes
after
incubation
for
3
years
with
benzene
as
sole
source
of
carbon
and
energy
Phelps
et
al.
1998
Four
clones
belonged
to
the
Desulfobacteraceae
the
other
phylotypes
were
affiliated
to
Thiomicrospira
Gammaproteobacteria
Sulfurovum
Epsilonproteobacteria
Bellilinea
Chloroflexi
Exiguobacterium
Bacilli
as
well
as
several
members
of
the
Clostridia
and
Bacteroidetes
according
to
the
RDP
Classifier
Wang
et
al.
2007
After
more
than
10
years
of
incubation
a
phylotype
belonging
to
the
Desulfobacteraceae
‘
clone
SB-21
’
was
identified
by
DNA-SIP
for
assimilating
benzene
in
this
culture
Oka
et
al.
2008
Notably
a
phylotype
closely
related
to
clone
SB-21
was
found
to
be
the
dominant
organism
in
a
benzene-mineralizing
sulfate-reducing
culture
enriched
also
from
marine
sediment
Musat
and
Widdel
2008
Furthermore
phylotypes
related
to
the
Desulfobacteraceae
were
detected
in
higher
abundances
in
two
benzene-degrading
freshwater
enrichments
able
to
use
sulfate
or
carbon
dioxide
as
electron
acceptor
Ulrich
and
Edwards
2003
Mancini
et
al.
2008
These
observations
suggest
that
members
of
the
Desulfobacteraceae
are
key
players
of
benzene
degradation
under
sulfate-reducing
conditions
However
despite
enrichment
with
benzene
for
several
years
all
of
these
cultures
contained
still
other
phylotypes
and
a
single
benzene-degrading
Desulfobacteraceae-like
organism
could
not
be
isolated
from
any
of
the
described
cultures
Therefore
it
is
possible
that
benzene
is
mineralized
in
these
cultures
by
synergetic
or
syntrophic
relationships
of
Desulfobacteraceae
and
other
organisms
this
can
be
at
least
assumed
for
the
enrichment
cultures
which
can
use
both
sulfate
and
carbon
dioxide
as
electron
acceptors
In
addition
to
phylotypes
belonging
to
the
Gram-negative
Desulfobacteraceae
Gram-positive
members
of
the
family
Peptococcaceae
seem
to
be
key
players
of
sulfate-dependent
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
The
enrichment
culture
of
Laban
and
colleagues
2009
was
dominated
by
a
phylotype
related
to
the
genus
Pelotomaculum
the
authors
assumed
that
this
organism
may
assimilate
benzene
solely
using
sulfate
as
electron
acceptor

the
Desulfotomaculum
subcluster

of
the
Peptococcaceae
Imachi
et
al.
2006
was
shown
to
be
crucial
for
sulfate-dependent
benzene
mineralization
as
T-RFLP
peak
abundances
of
this
organism
increased
after
prolonged
incubation
with
benzene
and
decreased
during
growth
on
other
substrates
Kleinsteuber
et
al.
2008
Moreover
this
phylotype
and
also
an
Epsilonproteobacterium
distantly
related
to
the
genus
Sulfurovum
assimilated
carbon
from
13C-labelled
benzene
in
a
subsequent
DNA-SIP
experiment
Herrmann
et
al.
2010
In
this
experiment
small
amounts
of
13C-labelled
benzene
were
converted
to
13C-labelled
methane
and
members
of
the
aceticlastic
Methanosaetaceae
were
detected
in
an
archaeal
16S
rRNA
gene
clone
library
In
addition
several
sulfate-reducing
Deltaproteobacteria
were
detected
but
not
found
to
be
13C-labelled
in
spite
of
prolonged
incubation
with
benzene

et

It
was
further
shown
that
benzene
mineralization
could
be
reversibly
inhibited
by
addition
of
hydrogen
or
low
amounts
of

It
was
therefore
suggested
that
benzene
is
mineralized
by
a

consisting
of
syntrophic

hydrogenotrophic
sulfate
reducers

Contaminated

might
be
a
specific
ecological
niche
for
syntrophic
benzene

as
syntrophs
are
versatile
regarding
the
terminal

acceptor
and
specifically
adapted
to
a
life
at

At
the

anaerobic
benzene
degradation
likely
with

This
method
which
is
explained
in
more
detail
below
has
generally
great
potential
to
verify
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
in
contaminated
aquifers
due
to
the
strong
hydrogen
isotope
fractionation
linked
to

in
this

were
distantly
related
to
Pelobacter

Nitrate

reduced
to
dinitrogen
during
benzene

the

balance
of
reduced

a

belonging

was
able
to

benzene
with

However
in
the
last
step
of
the
chlorate
reduction
pathway
chlorite
dismutates
to
oxygen
and
chloride
Biochemical
and
physiological
data
suggest
that
this
bacterium
uses
the
oxygen
released
during
chlorate
reduction
as
a
co-substrate
for
the
initial
attack
and
ring
cleavage
of
benzene
thus
it
can
not
be
regarded
as
a
true
anaerobic
benzene
degrader
Benzene
degradation
by
chlorate
reduction
is
excellently
and
extensively
described
in
the
recent
review
of
Weelink
and
colleagues
2010
Mechanisms
of
anaerobic
benzene
activation
The
question
how
benzene
is
activated
in
the
absence
of
oxygen
is
still
not
convincingly
answered
although
several
attempts
have
been
made
since
the
end
of
the
1980s
to
elucidate
the
activation
mechanism
In
principle
the
benzene
molecule
is
thermodynamically
very
stable
due
to
the
symmetric
π-electron
system
of
the
aromatic
ring
and
the
lack
of
potentially
destabilizing
or
reactive
substituents
Many
alkylated
aromatic
hydrocarbons
e.g
toluene
and
xylenes
are
activated
under
anoxic
conditions
by
a
reaction
sequence
in
which
fumarate
is
added
to
the
alkyl
side-chain
of
the
aromatic
ring
for
a
review
see
Heider
2007
In
the
first
step
of
this
reaction
a
relatively
stable
benzyl
radical
is
thought
to
be
formed
One
might
suggest
that
benzene
is
activated
by
a
similar
mechanism
however
the
formation
of
a
phenyl
radical
as
a
reactive
intermediate
for
a
subsequent
methylation
or
other
reaction
is
rather
unlikely
for
energetic
reasons
The
abstraction
of
a
hydrogen
atom
from
benzene
would
need
an
activation
energy
of
more
than
460
kJ
mol−1
which
is
roughly
100
kJ
mol−1
more
compared
with
the
formation
of
a
benzyl
radical
from
alkylated
benzene
derivatives
Widdel
and
Rabus
2001
Musat
and
Widdel
2008
Thus
three
other
activation
mechanisms
have
been
intensively
discussed
i
an
anaerobic
hydroxylation
of
benzene
yielding
phenol
ii
a
Friedel-Crafts-type
methylation
of
benzene
yielding
toluene
and
iii
a
carboxylation
of
benzene
yielding
benzoate
Fig
2
We
will
discuss
the
pros
and
cons
for
all
three
possible
activation
reactions
Generally
isotope-based
methods
have
been
used
to
elucidate
the
reaction
mechanism
either
by
CSIA
or
by
detection
of
13C-
or
14C-labelled
metabolites
which
are
formed
during
transformation
of
13C-
or
14C-labelled
benzene
Due
to
the
lack
of
pure
cultures
most
studies
aiming
to
elucidate
the
reaction
mechanism
were
performed
with
enrichment
cultures
Benzene
hydroxylation
Benzene
hydroxylation
by
hydroxyl
ions
stemming
from
water
is
an
attractive
model
for
benzene
activation
as
the
redox
potential
for
this
reaction
is
comparably
low

and
hence
likely
possible
even
under
sulfate-reducing
or
methanogenic
conditions
Phenol
itself
has
been
shown
to
be
mineralized
by
facultative
and
strictly
anaerobic
bacteria
the
degradation
pathway
proceeds
via
a
carbon

carboxylation
of
the
aromatic
ring

4-hydroxybenzoate
and
further
transformation

Hydroxylation
of
benzene
had
been
already
suggested
as
an
initial
reaction
mechanism
for
benzene
activation
in
one
of
the
first
reports
regarding
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
Vogel
and
Grbic-Galic
1986
Addition
of
18O-labelled
water
resulted
in
the
formation
of
18O-labelled
phenol
indicating
that
the
introduced
hydroxyl
group
originated
from
water
In
subsequent
reports
phenol
was
often
detected
in
enrichments
as
metabolite
of
benzene
degradation
under
different
electron
acceptor
conditions
in
iron-reducing
cultures

Weiner

Caldwell
and

Ulrich
et

In
some
studies
benzoate
was
concomitantly
detected
with
phenol
Caldwell
and
Suflita
2000
Ulrich
et
al.
2005
Kunapuli
et
al.
2008
It
is
noteworthy
that
it
has
recently
been
observed
that
phenol
can
be
abiotically
formed
from
benzene
in
culture
media
from
iron
and
sulfate
reducers
by
contact
with
air
after
sampling
Kunapuli
et
al.
2008
Hydroxyl
radicals
were
likely
generated
by
oxidation
of
iron
in
the
sample
during
work
up
which
then
reacted
rapidly
with
benzene
producing
small
amounts
of
phenol
before
sample
analysis
The
formation
of
2-hydroxybenzoate
and
4-hydroxybenzoate
from
benzoate
was
also
explained
by
these
mechanisms
Laban
et
al.
2009
These
results
indicate
that
it
is
generally
problematic
to
distinguish
between
biotic
and
abiotic
phenol
formation
in
strongly
reduced
culture
samples
probably
preventing
any
clear
evidence
for
benzene
hydroxylation
under
strictly
anoxic
conditions
by
means
of
metabolite
analysis
Hence
other
methodological
approaches
are
needed
in
addition
Substrate
consumption
tests
with
two
highly
enriched
sulfate-reducing
benzene-degrading
cultures
revealed
that
phenol
is
either
not
consumed
Laban
et
al.
2009
or
only
consumed
after
a
certain
lag-phase
Musat
and
Widdel
2008
strongly
indicating
that
phenol
is
unlikely
to
be
an
intermediate
during
benzene
degradation
in
these
cultures
Chakraborty
and
Coates
2005
suggested
that
Dechloromonas
strain
RCB
hydroxylated
benzene
to
phenol
which
was
subsequently
transformed
to
benzoate
the
reaction
was
dependent
on
the
presence
of
nitrate
as
electron
acceptor
Here
the
authors
did
not
report
phenol
formation
or
benzene
degradation
in
anoxic
nitrate-free
control
cultures
amended
with
benzene
The
origin
of
the
introduced
hydroxyl
group
could
not
be
identified
When
cells
degraded
benzene
in
H218O-enriched
mineral
salt
medium
the
formed
phenol
was
only
slightly
enriched
with
18O
suggesting
that
the
hydroxyl
group
did
not
originate
from
water
On
the
other
hand
hydroxyl
free
radical
scavengers
strongly
inhibited
benzene
degradation
and
phenol
formation
indicating
that
hydroxyl
radicals
were
the
source
of
the
hydroxyl
group
in
phenol
In
an
additional
study
Chakraborty
and
colleagues
2005
showed
that
strain
RCB
could
degrade
benzene
and
several
other
aromatic
hydrocarbons
with
nitrate
chlorate
or
oxygen
as
electron
acceptor
Surprisingly
none
of
the
known
genes
for
anaerobic
degradation
of
aromatic
compounds
could
be
found
in
the
genome
of
strain
RCB
which
was
recently
sequenced
Salinero
et
al.
2009
Due
to
the
lack
of
these
genes
anaerobic

‘

’
Salinero
et

On
the
other
hand
strain
RCB
encodes
several
aerobic
pathways
for
aromatics
degradation
In
the
presence
of
chlorate
this
organism
releases
oxygen
during
chlorate
respiration
allowing
aromatics
degradation
by
means
of
oxygenases
even
in
the
initial
absence
of
oxygen
in

strain
RCB
may
contain
this
enzyme
allowing
the
use
of
oxygen
for
the
initial
attack
of
benzene
and
other
aromatics
even
under
nitrate-reducing
conditions
explaining
the
apparently
inconsistent
physiological
and
genetic
data
Unfortunately
the
oxygen-releasing
enzyme
has
not
been
characterized
and
can
therefore
not
yet
be
identified
in
the
genome
of

RCB
The
genome
of
strain
RCB
contains
the
genes
for
the
classical

those
for

Benzene
methylation
Benzene
methylation
via
Friedel-Crafts-type
reaction
is
exergonic
using
the
unique
biological
methyl
donors
S-adenosyl-methionine
or
methyl-tetrahydrofolate
Coates
et
al.
2002
which
open
the
doors
for
another
hypothesis
for
anaerobic
benzene
activation
Actually
S-adenosyl-methione-dependent
alkylation
of
benzene
and
substituted
aromatics
has
been
observed
in
bone
marrow
Flesher
and
Myers
1991
Methylation
has
been
also
proposed
for
the
anaerobic
activation
of
the
non-substituted
aromatic
hydrocarbon
naphthalene
Safinowski
and
Meckenstock
2006
If
benzene
is
methylated
by
anaerobes
the
reaction
product
toluene
could
be
further
activated
by
addition
of
fumarate
to
the
methyl
group
of
toluene
catalysed
by
the
enzyme
benzylsuccinate
synthase
BSS
leading
to
the
characteristic
compound
benzylsuccinate
as
intermediate
BSS
has
been
detected
in
several
anaerobic
toluene-degrading
pure
and
mixed
cultures
and
fumarate
addition
seems
to
be
a
unique
activation
mechanism
for
anaerobic
toluene
degradation

an
overview

Thus
reasonable
strategies
for
verifying
benzene
activation
by
methylation
are
detecting
the
intermediates
toluene
and
benzylsuccinate
or
detecting
the

The
formation
of
13C6
-phenol
was
observed
only
in
the
methanogenic
culture
The
nitrate-reducing
culture
degraded
toluene
rapidly
and
at
higher
rates
than
benzene
supporting
the
hypothesis
that
toluene
might
be
an
intermediate
during
benzene
degradation
in
this
culture
In
contrast
toluene
was
only
slightly
degraded
by
the
methanogenic
culture
The
authors
concluded
that
two
degradation
pathways
exist

a
methylation
pathway
leading
to
toluene
with
subsequent
transformation
to
benzoate
operating
in
the
nitrate-reducing
and
methanogenic
culture
and
ii
a
hydroxylation
pathway
leading
to
phenol
with
subsequent
formation
of
benzoate
operating
only
in
the
methanogenic
culture
This
hypothesis
was
supported
by
studies
in
which
CSIA
was
used
for
characterizing
the
initial
step
of
benzene
activation
in
different
cultures
Mancini
et
al.
2003
2008
Fischer
et
al.
2008
Mancini
and
colleagues
2008
showed
that
the
ratio
of
hydrogen
isotope
fractionation
Δδ2H
versus
carbon
isotope
fractionation
Δδ13C
–
a
value
defined
as
lambda
Λ
Δδ2H/Δδ13C
Fischer
et
al.
2008
–
for
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
was
significantly
higher
for
the
methanogenic
culture
Λ
39
±
5
compared
with
the
nitrate-reducing
enrichment
culture
Λ
16
±
2
investigated
by
Ulrich
and
colleagues
2005
Simplified
the
lambda
value
can
be
seen
as
a
biochemical
fingerprint
of
a
given
biochemical
reaction
Concordantly
other
nitrate-reducing
cultures
showed
lambda
values
in
the
range
between
8
and
19
whereas
for
other
methanogenic
or
sulfate-reducing
cultures
lambda
values
between
28
and
31
were
determined
Mancini
et
al.
2003
2008
Fischer
et
al.
2008
Thus
the
CSIA
data
indicate
that
benzene
activation
under
nitrate-reducing
conditions
is
different
from
benzene
activation
under
sulfate-reducing
and
methanogenic
conditions
Nevertheless
‘
different
reaction
mechanism
’
means
that
either
the
reactions
are
truly
different
different
products
are
formed
or
the
reactions
are
similar
on
paper
same
products
are
formed
but
proceed
via
different
reaction
mechanisms
catalysed
by
different
enzymes
or
cofactors
leading
to
different
fractionation
patterns
the
latter
has
been
recently
shown
for
toluene
activation
by
benzylsuccinate
synthase
Vogt
et
al.
2008
Herrmann
et
al.
2009
Hence
further
research
is
needed
to
conclusively
demonstrate
that
benzene
can
be
methylated
under
nitrate-reducing
conditions
Some
highly
enriched
strictly
anaerobic
benzene-degrading
cultures
can
not
degrade

probably
excluding
biomethylation
of

to

as

mechanism
Benzene
carboxylation
Similar
to
hydroxylation
or
methylation
of
benzene
benzene
carboxylation
is
slightly
exergonic
or
close
to
the
thermodynamic
equilibrium
depending
on
the
carboxyl
donor
and
thus
feasible
even
in
sulfate-reducing
or
methanogenic
cultures
Musat
and
Widdel
2008
Additionally
for
some
non-substituted
aromatic
compounds
e.g
naphthalene
Zhang
and
Young
1997
Musat
et

or
phenanthrene
Zhang
and
Young
1997
Davidova
et
al.
2007
a
carboxylation
reaction
was
suggested
for
ring
activation
indicating
that
carboxylation
might
be
an
important
activation
principle
for
the
degradation
of
non-substituted
aromatic
compounds
in
nature
Indeed
benzoate
has
been
detected
as

of

benzene

as
sole

of

degradation
in
their
highly
enriched
marine
sulfate-reducing
culture
Interestingly
incubation
in
the
presence
of
a
13C-labelled
bicarbonate
buffer
system
did
not
lead
to
13C
incorporation
in
the
carboxyl
group
of
the
benzoate
intermediate
indicating
that
the
introduced
carboxyl
group
did
not
originate
from
carbon
dioxide
This
was
in
accordance
with
results
presented
by
Caldwell
and
Suflita
2000
for
their
benzene-degrading
sulfate-reducing
freshwater
culture
Here
fully
13C7
-labelled
benzoate
was
formed
when
the
culture
was
spiked
with
fully
13C6
-labelled
benzene
showing
that
the
carboxyl
group
of
benzoate
was
stemming
from
transformation
products
of
13C6
-benzene
itself
but
not
from
the
non-labelled
bicarbonate
buffer
system
In
contrast
Kunapuli
and
colleagues
2008
found
both
13C6
-benzoate
and
13C7
-benzoate
in
their
iron-reducing
enrichment
culture
during
incubation
with
fully
labelled
13C6
-benzene
Furthermore
the
authors
detected
13C-carboxy
group-labelled
benzoate
if
cells
were
incubated
in
medium
prepared
with
non-labelled
benzene
and
13C-labelled
bicarbonate
buffer
favouring
the
hypothesis
that
the
bicarbonate
buffer
was
the
carboxyl
group
donor
for
benzoate
formation
However
it
is
generally
difficult
to
interpret
all
these
observations
since
benzoyl-CoA
the
activated
form
of
benzoate
is
a
common
intermediate
within
the
anaerobic
degradation
pathways
of
several
aromatic
compounds
including
toluene
and
phenol
for
an
overview
see
Carmona
et
al.
2009

in
addition
benzoate
has

Hence
the
metabolite
benzoate
might
be
formed
directly
from
benzene
by
a
carboxylation
step
but
could
be
formed
as
well
in
later
steps
during
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
pathways
starting
e.g
with
a
methylation
or
hydroxylation
step
Lately
Laban
and
colleagues
2010
investigated
their
highly
enriched
iron-reducing
benzene-degrading
culture
using
an
approach
combining
metagenomics
and
metaproteomics
Subcultures
were
grown
with
benzene
phenol
or
benzoate
as
sole
substrates
and
peptide
sequences
were
subsequently
identified
based
on
the
metagenome
which
had
been
sequenced
before
Proteins
similar
to
the
phenylphosphate
carboxylase
subunits
PpcA
and
PpcD
of
Azoarcus
sp
strain
EbN1
and
to
the
benzoate-CoA
ligase
of
Geobacter
metallireducens
were
specifically
expressed
during
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
Based
on
these
results
the
authors
suggested
that
benzene
is
directly
carboxylated
by
a
putative
anaerobic
benzene
carboxylase
The
formed
benzoate
might
be
further
activated
by
a
benzoate-CoA
ligase
to
benzoyl-CoA
However
an
enzyme
activity
test
for
the
putative
anaerobic
benzene
carboxylase
ultimately
proving
this
hypothesis
could
not
be
established
yet
Outlook
–
what
is
needed
for
a
better
understanding
of
the
mechanisms
of
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
Isolating
strictly
anaerobic
benzene-degrading
bacteria
is
still
important
for
a
better
understanding
of
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
Sequencing
the
genome
of
such
an
organism
may
allow
revealing
the
upper
and
lower
degradation
pathway
also
more
controlled
physiological
experiments
would
be
possible
for
elucidating
the
anaerobic
benzene
activation
mechanism
However
the
gene
encoding
the
responsible
enzyme
might
be
not
yet
detectable
within
the
genome
due
to
the
unknown
enzyme
properties
Establishing
any
in
vitro
or
in
vivo
assay
undoubtedly
proving
a
specific
activation
mechanism
is
clearly
needed
For
highly
enriched
benzene-degrading
cultures
sequencing
of
the
metagenome
might
be
very
helpful
to
clarify
syntrophic
or
cooperative
relationships
as
for
example
recently
shown
for
anaerobic
methane
oxidation

Gene-targeted-metagenomics
reveals
extensive
diversity
of
aromatic
dioxygenase
genes
in
the
environment
Understanding
the
relationship
between
gene
diversity
and
function
for
important
environmental
processes
is
a
major
ecological
research
goal
We
applied
gene-targeted
metagenomics
and
pyrosequencing
to
aromatic
dioxygenase
genes
to
obtain
greater
sequence
depth
than
possible
by
other
methods
A
polymerase

designed
to
target
a
524-bp
region
that
confers
substrate
specificity
of
biphenyl
dioxygenases
yielded
2000
and
604
sequences
from
the
5′
and
3′
ends
of
PCR
products
respectively
which
passed
our
validity
criteria
Sequence
alignment
showed
three
known
conserved
residues
as
well
as
another
seven
conserved
residues
not
reported
earlier
Of
the
valid
sequences
95
and
41
were
assigned
to
22
and
3
novel
clusters
in
that
they
did
not
include
any
earlier
reported
sequences
at
0.6
distance
by
complete
linkage
clustering
for
sequenced
regions
The
greater
diversity
revealed
by
this
gene-targeted
approach
provides
deeper
insights
into
genes
potentially
important
in
environmental
processes
to
better
understand
their
ecology
functional
differences
and
evolutionary
origins
We
also
provide
criteria
for
primer
design
for
this
approach
as
well
as
guidance
for
data
processing
of
diverse
functional
genes
as
gene
databases
for
most
genes
of
environmental
relevance
are
limited
Metagenomics
circumvents
the
problem
of
unculturability
and
has
the
potential
to
understand
microbial
communities
at
their
aggregate
level
transcending
the
individual
organism
to
focus
on
the
genes
in
a
community
National
Research
Council
2007
Because
of
the
extensive
genetic
diversity
of
most
microbial
communities
it
is
currently
impossible
to
obtain
enough
sequence
depth
to
sample
any
gene
with
sufficient
coverage
to
draw
meaningful
conclusions
with
regard
to
its
diversity
or
population
characteristics
This
is
particularly
important
in
cases
in
which
functional
screens
are
problematic
because
of
expression
requirements
such
as
for
protein
complexes
To
overcome
this
limitation
approaches
are
needed
to
target
sequencing
capacity
to
genes
of
particular
interest
One
approach
is
to
use
polymerase
chain
reaction
PCR
-based
targeting
together
with
pyrosequencing
technology
similar
to
the
manner
in
which
it
is
currently
carried
out
for
16S
rRNA
gene
sequencing
Sogin
et
al.
2006
Huber
et
al.
2007
This
approach
which
we
term
gene-targeted
metagenomics
GT-metagenomics
should
then
provide
more
extensive
insight
into
the
diversity
that
nature
has
produced
as
well
as
provide
sequence
information
for
probes
to
use
in
recovering
the
entire
gene
from
clades
of
interest
As
many
studies
have
shown
that
the
mutation
of
a
few
amino
acids
can
critically
affect
the
structure
of
individual
enzymes
changing
their
substrate
utilization
and
degradation
activities

understanding
gene
diversity
in
nature
can
reveal
the
functional
ecological
and
evolutionary
patterns
of
key
genes
The
GT-metagenomics
approach
requires
that
the
targeted
gene
has
sufficiently
conserved
regions
of
appropriate
distance
for
emulsion
PCR
which
is
required
for
pyrosequencing
so
that
primers
or
sets
of
primers
will
sufficiently
cover
a
gene
family
This
approach
is
likely
to
be
most
useful
for
genes
directly
responsible
for
important
ecosystem
functions
or
ecological
processes
such
as
biogeochemical
cycles
biodegradation
pathogenesis
antibiotic
resistances
and
cell
signaling
We
tested
this
approach
on
a
set
of
dioxygenase
genes
important
in
carbon
cycle
for
the
turnover
of
more
recalcitrant
organic
carbon
as
well
as
for
pollutant
degradation
We
also
discuss
requirements
for
primer
design
for
GT-metagenomics
and
the
subsequent
data
analysis
Our
results
show
a
much
greater
diversity
of
genes
potentially
important
in
nature

than

Introduction
Metagenomics
circumvents
the
problem
of
unculturability
and
has
the
potential
to
understand
microbial
communities
at
their
aggregate
level
transcending
the
individual
organism
to
focus
on
the
genes
in
a
community
National
Research
Council
2007
Because
of
the
extensive
genetic
diversity
of
most
microbial
communities
it
is
currently
impossible
to
obtain
enough
sequence
depth
to
sample
any
gene
with
sufficient
coverage
to
draw
meaningful
conclusions
with
regard
to
its
diversity
or
population
characteristics
This
is
particularly
important
in
cases
in
which
functional
screens
are
problematic
because
of
expression
requirements
such
as
for
protein
complexes
To
overcome
this
limitation
approaches
are
needed
to
target
sequencing
capacity
to
genes
of
particular
interest
One
approach
is
to
use
polymerase
chain
reaction
PCR
-based
targeting
together
with
pyrosequencing
technology
similar
to
the
manner
in
which
it
is
currently
carried
out
for
16S
rRNA
gene
sequencing
Sogin
et
al.
2006
Huber
et
al.
2007
This
approach
which
we
term
gene-targeted
metagenomics
GT-metagenomics
should
then
provide
more
extensive
insight
into
the
diversity
that
nature
has
produced
as
well
as
provide
sequence
information
for
probes
to
use
in
recovering
the
entire
gene
from
clades
of
interest
As
many
studies
have
shown
that
the
mutation
of
a
few
amino
acids
can
critically
affect
the
structure
of
individual
enzymes
changing
their
substrate
utilization
and
degradation
activities

understanding
gene
diversity
in
nature
can
reveal
the
functional
ecological
and
evolutionary
patterns
of
key
genes
The
GT-metagenomics
approach
requires
that
the
targeted
gene
has
sufficiently
conserved
regions
of
appropriate
distance
for
emulsion
PCR
which
is
required
for
pyrosequencing
so
that
primers
or
sets
of
primers
will
sufficiently
cover
a
gene
family
This
approach
is
likely
to
be
most
useful
for
genes
directly
responsible
for
important
ecosystem
functions
or
ecological
processes
such
as
biogeochemical
cycles
biodegradation
pathogenesis
antibiotic
resistances
and
cell
signaling
We
tested
this
approach
on
a
set
of
dioxygenase
genes
important
in
carbon
cycle
for
the
turnover
of
more
recalcitrant
organic
carbon
as
well
as
for
pollutant
degradation
We
also
discuss
requirements
for
primer
design
for
GT-metagenomics
and
the
subsequent
data
analysis
Our
results
show
a
much
greater
diversity
of
genes
potentially
important
in
nature
's

cycle
than
realized

Determination
of
valid

Sequences
were
first
trimmed
of
the
primer
region
and
low-quality
sequences
were
removed
as
follows
We
plotted
the
number
of
sequences
against
the
first
position
of
an
ambiguous
base
call
or
stop
codon
We
determined
the
length
for
analysis
to
be
at
the
position
where
the
plotted
curve
dropped
sharply
175
bp
for
BPHD-f3
sequences
and
200
bp
for
BPHD-r1
sequences
To
remove
possible
frameshift
errors
each
sequence
was
used
as
a
BLASTX
query
against
a
BLAST
database
of
the
translated
library
using
a
0.001
E-value
cutoff
to
determine
the
top

closest
matches
Those
reads
with
the
greatest
number
of
hits
that
include
any
out-of-frame
segments
were
successively
discarded
as
both

Discussion
The
particular
region
amplified
the
degree
of
coverage
of
the
target
gene
family
and
the
specificity
of
primer
sets
are
critical
for
designing
PCR
primer
sets
to
assess
gene
populations
in
a
community
For
pyrosequencing
the
length
of
the
PCR
product
must
not
be
too
long
or
it
will
reduce
emulsion
PCR
efficiency

We
selected
the
particular
524
bp
region
because
it
provided
suitably
conserved
primer
sites
was
of
suitable
length
and
covered
a
region
known
to
be
functionally
important
confers
substrate
specificity
Our
primer
set
had
48-
and
16-fold
degeneracy
for
BPHD-f3
and
BPHD-r1
respectively
to
obtain
a
good
coverage
of
target
genes
As
increasing
degeneracy
caused
less
specificity
of
the
primer
set
the
degeneracy
used
here
was
optimal
for
maximizing
coverage
without
sacrificing
specificity
After
we
removed
low-quality
sequences
likely
because
of
sequencing
error
and/or
nondioxygenase
sequences
and
those
without
conserved
positions
80
and
72
of
raw
sequences
remained
as
valid
sequences
for
BPHD-f3
and
BPHD-r1
respectively
These
high
ratios
indicate
enough
primer
specificity
for
further
analysis
As
a
result
95
and
41
of
valid
sequences
were
assigned
to
novel
type
i
clusters
Although
we
designed
the
primers
using
only
toluene/biphenyl
dioxygenase
it
is
interesting
that
the
deeper
sequencing
allowed
us
to
obtain
a
much
broader
range
of
apparent
dioxygenase
genes
For
example
clusters
F24
and
R5
contain
all
well-known
toluene/biphenyl
dioxygenase
genes
and
clusters
F35
and
R7
contain
all
well-known
naphthalene
dioxygenase
genes

and

This
provides
a
perspective
on
the
size
of
clusters
with
and
without
reference
sequences
and
hence
on
the
diversity
of
the
novel
dioxygenase
genes
The
detection
of
novel
conserved
residues
such
as
the
seven
found
in
this
study
illustrates
one
of
the
useful
outputs
from
the
GT-metagenomics
approach
in
that
it
better
reveals
what
nature
has
selected
which
can
not
be
observed
from
either
pure
culture
or
shotgun
metagenomics
approaches
On
the
basis
of
earlier
reports
six
out
of
the
seven
residues
have
not
been
studied
for
their
structural
or
functional
importance
for
Rieske
nonheme
iron
dioxygenase
genes
such
as
biphenyl
dioxygenase
Furusawa
et
al.
2004
cumene
dioxygenase
Dong
et
al.
2005
or
naphthalene
dioxygenase
Karlsson
et
al.
2003
However
this
high
conservation
ratio
suggests
that
they
have
some
structural
or
functional
role
and
hence
provide
new
targets
for
site-directed
mutagenesis
studies
Moreover
those
novel
conserved
regions
allow
us
to
design
new
primer
sets
to
explore
further
diversity
of
genes
The
larger
challenge
in
GT-metagenomics
is
data
analysis
We
tested
several
approaches
First
we
selected
a
representative
sequence
from
each
0.6
distance
cluster
on
the
basis
of
amino-acid
sequences
and
tried
to
build
a
phylogenetic
tree
However
those
sequences
were
too
diverse
to
produce
a
reliable
tree
the
bootstrap
values
were
very
low
We
then
tried
a
model
approach
to
show
the
distribution
of
pyrosequenced
sequences
against
known
genes
The
model
approach
is
used
to
search
and
create
databases
on
the
basis
of
the
relatedness
to
a
certain
group
of
functional
genes
such
as
by
FGPR
We
built
two
protein
models
on
the
basis
of
a
set
of
known
dioxygenase
genes
in
the
toluene/biphenyl
family
and
a
set
of
all
well-known
Rieske
nonheme
iron
dioxygenase
genes
which
includes
toluene/biphenyl
naphthalene
benzoate
and
phthalate
families
The
valid
sequences
were
searched
against
those
models
using
Hidden
Markov
Model
and
scores
of
each
sequence
to
the
model
were
calculated
Only
68
of
valid
sequences
had
scores
to
either
of
the
models
for
BPHD-f3
sequences
In
contrast
100
of
valid
BPHD-r1
sequences
had
scores
to
either
one
of
the
models
This
might
be
because
the
model
was
based
on
known
genes
and
could
not
give
similarity
scores
to
the
completely
novel
genes
The
advantage
of
this
method
is
that
we
can
compare
sequences
on
the
basis
of
the
score
to
the
model
regardless
of
region
and
length
When
there
is
enough
reference
gene
information
for
example
by
adding
new
clusters
obtained
in
this
and
other
studies
to
provide
a
more
stable
model
the
model
approach
will
be
a
useful
method
to
map
and
compare
sequences
obtained
from
different
regions
of
the
gene
The
most
abundant
cluster
in
BPHD-r1
sequences
was
the
novel
type
i
cluster
with
48
of
total
valid
sequences
Figure
3
However
there
is
no
such
large
type
i
cluster
in
BPHD-f3
In
the
same
manner
we
found
differences
between
BPHD-f3
and
BPHD-r1
clustering
in
terms
of
the
proportion
of
clusters
in
each
type
This
suggests
a
further
complexity
of
environmental
dioxygenases
composed
of
different
combinations
of
those
clusters
in
one
gene
Advances
in
sequencing
technology
that
provide
greater
read
length
such
as
the
recently
introduced
GS

Titanium
Series
which
can
extend
read
length
to
400–500
bp
http

will
be
a
great
help
with
GT-metagenomics
approaches
A
this
GT-metagenomics
approach
is
based
on
PCR
products
it
similar
to
all
PCR-based
approaches
should
be
assumed
to
have
primer
bias
and
can
not
be
comprehensive
or
reflect
actual
quantification
It
can
however
reveal
much
more
sequence
information
about
the
genes
it
does
recover
and
hence
more
insight
into
what
nature
has
produced
Functional
genes
often
have
less
conserved
regions
and
the
current
sequenced
length
is
less
than
desired
Thus
using
several
different
primer
sets
which
can
be
designed
from
new
conserved
regions
and
combining
information
from
the
model
approach
should
help
to
better
understand
the
biology
behind
gene
diversity
This
information
should
also
provide
the
probes
or
other
tools
that
can
aid
the
recovery
of
full-length
gene
sequences
from
the
environment
for
functional
studies
Moreover
testing
the
expression
and
activity
of
those
genes
toward
aromatic
hydrocarbons
will
be
important
for
suggesting
their
function
in
nature

Introduction
The
environment
fosters
an
intricate
combination
of
organisms
nutrients
and
physical
matrices
harbouring
almost
immeasurable
niche
diversity
Within
this
context
microorganisms
inhabit
every
conceivable
location
on
earth
gaining
energy
by
coupling
most
energetically
favourable
electron
donors
and
receptors

Linking
the
identification
of
uncultured
microorganisms
with
their
potential
to
metabolize
compounds
in
the
environment
represents
the
Holy
Grail
of
scientific
discovery
for
microbial
ecologists
The
advent
of
stable-
and
radioactive-isotope-based
techniques
was
welcomed
for
the
link
it
provided
between
the
phylogeny
and
function
of
uncultivated
microbes
Stable-isotope
probing
SIP
for
use
in
microbial
ecology
was
based
on
the
premise
that
a
physiologically
active
subset
of
organisms
within
environmental
samples
when
offered
substrates
labelled
with
a
stable
isotope
would
incorporate
the
heavier
C-
or
N-source
into
cell
components

for

of
specific
sub-populations

microorganisms
that
metabolized

the

Lee

offered
microbial
ecologists
the

to
directly
observe
the
incorporation
of
substrates
labelled
with
a
radioactive
isotope
into
single
microbial
cells
Over
the
past
few
years
dedicated
research
in
many
laboratories
has
refined
earlier
SIP
and
FISH-MAR
methodology
by
reducing
bias
increasing
sensitivity
and
expanding
the
applications
of
isotope
studies
multiple
environments
substrates
and
target
organisms
Related
techniques
are
rapidly
being
developed
and
gaining
in
applicability
For
example
isotope
arrays
Raman
microscopy
and
nanoSIMS
are
all
expanding
our
suite
of
isotope-based
techniques
Here
we
highlight
recent
and
notable
achievements
including
up-and-coming
developments
that
are
set
to
transform

Stable-isotope
probing
SIP
experiments
are
dependent
upon
the
availability
of
suitable
stable
isotopes

for
example
13C
15N

and

For

of
these

fully
13C-labelled
substrates
were
purchased
from

However
limited
commercial
availability
of
13C-
or
15N-labelled
molecules
suitable
as
microbial
growth
substrates
constrains
the
design
of
isotope
experiments
As
a
result
several
research
groups
have
pioneered
in-house
chemical
and
biological
synthesis
for
the
preparation
of
their
desired

Such
creative
chemical
and
biological
synthesis
of
complex
organic
compounds
widens
the
application
and
versatility
of
SIP
One
of
the
challenges
of
SIP
experiments
is
employing
substrate
concentrations
and
incubation
times
that
mirror
the
in
situ
conditions
found
in
the
natural
environment
The
high
sensitivity
of
PLFA-SIP
helps
realize
this
goal
but
for
RNA-SIP
and
DNA-SIP
the
synthesis
of
labelled
nucleic
acid
must
be
sufficient
for
the
separation
and
detection
of
labelled
molecules
from
the
abundant
background
of
unlabelled
material
reviewed
by
Neufeld

Recent
developments
have
increased
the
sensitivity
of
the
nucleic
acid-based
SIP

Further

inefficient
but
this
shortcoming
has
been
overcome
by

of

Metagenomic
analysis
of
labelled
DNA
is
one
desired
goal
of
current
DNA-SIP
studies
Dumont

But
herein
lies
the
dilemma
incubate
samples
with
near

conditions
and
generate
low
nanogram
yields
of
labelled

unrealistic
substrate
concentrations
and

For
some
studies
so
little
is
known
about
the
organisms
and
genes
involved
in
metabolizing
a
particular
substrate
that
any
relevant
genetic
information
is
a
significant
discovery
incubation
conditions
are
less
important
However
a
likely
outcome
is
that
with
excessive
substrate
and
incubation
times
characterized
organisms
will
be
similar
to
those
previously
identified
with
cultivation-based
approaches
One
strong
possibility
for
future
innovation
is
the
ability
to
couple
low
substrate
incubations
phi29-based
whole-genome
amplification
of
labelled
DNA
and
metagenomics
analysis
The
major
hurdle
to
overcome
will
involve
balancing
the
cloning
of
large
DNA
fragments
with
the
associated
limitation
of
chimeric
artefacts
that
are
generated

The
traditional
SIP
technique
has
been
tweaked
and
modified
to
enable
a
suite
of
novel
applications
and
experiments
One
recent
advance
has
involved
improvements
to
the
labelling
and
detection
of
DNA
using
15N-labelled
substrates
Cadisch
et
al
2005
The
resolution
of
labelled
and
unlabelled
DNA
or
RNA
following
15N
incorporation
is
less
than
that
for
13C
incorporation
Cupples
et
al
2006
reflecting
the
differential
abundance
of
nitrogen
and
carbon
in
DNA
respectively
Buckley
et
al
2007b
have
demonstrated
a
unique
approach
to
disentangle
the
parallel
effects
of
G+C
content
and
isotopic
enrichment
on
isopycnic
separation
of
DNA
Through
a
combination
of
two
ultracentrifugation
steps
and
the
addition
of
an
intercalating
compound
to
the
second
ultracentrifugation
15N-labelled
DNA
is
effectively
separated
from
high
G+C
unlabelled
DNA
The
utility
of
such
an
approach
was
demonstrated
by
the
discovery
of
uncultured
and
putatively
novel
nitrogen-fixing
bacteria
in
the
Alphaproteobacteria
Rhodoplanes
Betaproteobacteria
and
Actinobacteria

demonstrated
the
utility
of
stable

18O
for
DNA-SIP
DNA
and
RNA
may
be
labelled
efficiently
with
18O
because
of
the
five
oxygen
atoms
per
nucleotide
in
the
sugar
backbone
of
DNA
in
addition
to
the
two
neutrons
offered
by
each
incorporated
molecule
of
stable
oxygen
Incubating
Escherichia
coli
cultures
or
soil
samples
with
H218O
yielded
DNA
from
actively
growing
cells
that
was
sufficiently
labelled
to
separate
18O-containing
DNA
from
a
background
of
18O-DNA
Such
an
approach
offers
a
substrate-independent
ability
to
characterize
active
community
members
and
will
be
particularly
helpful
in
examining
the
impact
of
moisture
content
on
soil
microbial
communities
Schwartz
2007
An
often-cited
disadvantage
of
SIP-based
studies
is
that
biomarkers
from
organisms
that
can
feed
on
metabolic
degradation
products
of
other
organisms
may
become
labelled
during
an
SIP
incubation
Cross-feeding
is
a
lingering
explanation
for
the
puzzling
observation
of
labelled
DNA
possessing
an
Acidobacteria
16S
ribosomal
RNA
rRNA
gene
sequence
after
a
soil
methanol
incubation
in
the
original
DNA-SIP
publication
Radajewski
et
al
2000
Regardless
of
this
what
has
been
a
common
criticism
that
is
'cross-feeding
can
now
be
turned
into
an
advantage
to
look
at
the
flow
of
carbon
through
ecosystems
For
several
SIP
experiments
studying
trophic
networks
was
performed
by
labelling
macroorganisms
that
provide
nutrients
for
a
natural
microbial
community
Cadisch
et
al
2005
Lu
and
Conrad
2005
Rangel-Castro
et
al
2005
or
by
labelling
microbial
cells
Lueders
et
al
2006
recently
conducted
a
cross-feeding
study
by
supplementing
indigenous
soil
microbial
communities
with
an
excess
of
13C-labelled
E.
coli
cells
An
important
consideration
was
that
the
soil
communities
were
monitored
over
time
revealing
a
complex
trophic
network
including
the
labelling
of
rRNA
gene
sequences
associated
with
gliding
micropredators
Near-future
SIP
developments
will
likely
include
its
combination
with
phylochips
for
highly
parallel
analyses
of
the
community
composition
represented
by
the
heavy
DNA
or
rRNA
Wagner
et
al
2007
and
the
long-awaited
advent
of
mRNA-SIP
and
polypeptide-SIP
The
current
DNA-SIP
protocol
Neufeld
et
al
2007b
does
not
directly
implicate
the
expression
of
genes
that
are
associated
with
labelled
DNA
The
RNA-SIP
protocol
Whiteley
et
al
2007
focusses
on
16S
rRNA
and
does
not
capture
mRNA
There
is
no
questioning
the
value
of
retrieving
expressed
genes
that
is
mRNA
or
synthesized
polypeptides
from
the
environment
which
are
involved
in
growth
on
a
particular
compound
Once
these
methods
are
developed
and
optimized
we
anticipate
that
both
mRNA-SIP
and
polypeptide-SIP
will
serve
as
sensitive
and
powerful
tools
assisting
in
novel
environmental
gene
discovery
and
complementing
experiments
that
use
RNA-SIP
and
DNA-SIP
SIP-based
studies
have
largely
focussed
on
the
discovery
of
taxonomic
and
functional
gene
sequences
associated
with
labelled
nucleic
acid
Understandably
the
environments
and
substrates
being
examined
yield
surprising
glimpses
into
organisms
involved
in
substrate
metabolism
A
few
examples
include
the
possible
involvement
of
Acidobacteria
in
methanol
metabolism
Radajewski
et
al
2000
a
possible
role
for
Betaproteobacteria
in
CH4
oxidation
Morris
et
al
2002
the
implication
of
a
Thauera
sp
in
phenol
degradation
Manefield
et
al
2002
and
the
role
of
methanogenic
Archaea
in
consuming
plant
exudates
Lu
and
Conrad
2005
However
SIP
experiments
offer
more
than
an
insight
into
unknown
and
uncultured
contributors
to
substrate
metabolism
Importantly
the
retrieval
and
characterization
of
sequences
belonging
to
extant
cultured
isolates
and
characterized
strains
suggests
that
the
organisms
we
study
in
the
laboratory
are
involved
in
relevant
processes
in
the
natural
environment
As
the
use
of
SIP
in
microbial
ecology
increases
we
anticipate
a
shift
from
discovery-driven
science
to
hypothesis-testing
experimentation
The
questions
SIP
may
be
used
to
answer
will
gradually
shift
from
'who
eats
what
to
'who
eats
what
where
and
when
Instead
of
simply
determining
which
organisms
consume
a
specific
substrate
in
a
particular
soil
we
anticipate
that
the
effects
of
pH
depth
latitude
altitude
or
temperature
on
active
microbes
will
be
elucidated
Such
experiments
would
be
best
served
by
carrying
out
SIP
alongside
ecosystem
process
measurements
demonstrating
the
relevance
of
substrate
concentrations
and
metabolic
rates
while
identifying
and
characterizing
functionally
relevant
microorganisms
With
substantial
research
interest
focussed
on
climate
change
ecosystem
loss
and
human
health
linking
active
organisms
with
their
preferred
C-
and
N-sources
will
remain
a
strong
research
incentive
in
microbial
ecology
one
for
which
SIP
can
play
an
ever-expanding
role

FISH-MAR
The
adoption
of
FISH
for
microbial
ecology
involved
the
use
of
16S
or
23S
rRNA-targeted
gene
probes
to
detect
single
microbial
cells
from
within
a
complex
microbial
community
reviewed
by
Wagner
et
al
2003
This
enabled
image
analysis-assisted
quantification
of
microbes
in
the
environment
Daims
et
al
2006
and
the
visualization
of
cells
relative
to
one
another
revealing
information
about
spatial
structuring
and
physical
interactions
that
occur
in
highly
aggregated
environments
such
as
biofilms
Gieseke
et
al
2001
and
activated
sludge
flocs
Maixner
et
al
2006
By
quickly
exposing
an
environmental
sample
to
a
low
dose
of
radioactively
labelled
substrate
slides
prepared
for
FISH
analysis
can
also
be
used
to
expose
an
autoradiographic
emulsion
for
several
days
causing
silver
grains
to
form
in
areas
immediately
adjacent
to
radioactive
cells
Now
referred
to
as
FISH-MAR
this
approach
which
requires
much
shorter
incubation
times
than
DNA-SIP
was
first
demonstrated
in
1999
Lee
et
al
1999
Ouverney
and
Fuhrman
1999
Since
then
FISH-MAR
has
provided
many
direct
cultivation-independent
links
between
the
phylogeny
and
function
of
individual
microbial
cells
in
various
natural
and
man-made
ecosystems
reviewed
by
Wagner
et
al
2006
At
present
FISH-MAR
can
target
up
to
seven
different
bacterial
populations
Amann
et
al
1996
uses
'hierarchical
probe
combinations
to
reduce
the
possibility
of
false-positive
signals
Loy
et
al

and
has
an
optical
resolution
of
0.5–2
mum
Nielsen
et
al
2003b
ideal
for
individual
microbial
cells
Further
the
number
of
silver
grains
formed
adjacent
to
individual
cells
provides
a
quantitative
estimate
of
the
contributions
of
different
cells
to
substrate
metabolism
Nielsen
et
al
2003a
In
oligotrophic
environments
physiologically
active
cells
may
contain
low
rRNA
copy
numbers
and
be
undetectable
with
standard
FISH
techniques
This
limitation
can
be
overcome
by
use
of
catalysed
reporter
deposition
with
horseradish
peroxidase-labelled
probes
CARD-FISH
which
can
also
be
combined
with
MAR
MICRO-CARD-FISH
Sintes
and
Herndl
2006
Recently
the
uptake
of
radiolabelled
substrate
into
FISH-identified
bacterial
populations
was
monitored
by
beta
microimaging
instead
of
MAR
Gieseke
et
al
2005
This
elegant
approach
offers
quantitative
data
without
the
need
of
counting
silver
grains
but
suffers
from
a
relatively
low
spatial
resolution
of
about
10
mum
which
is
above
the
single-cell
level
Therefore
this
technique
is
currently
only
suitable
for
application
to
well-structured
microbial
communities
like
those
found
in
biofilms
Gieseke
et
al
2005
microbial
mats
and
anaerobic
granules
Collins
et
al
2005
A
strength
of
FISH-MAR
is
that
the
detection
of
labelled
substrate
incorporation
does
not
rely
on
a
specific
biomarker
This
feature
increases
the
sensitivity
of
the
approach
and
enables
the
detection
of
certain
physiological
activities
like
the
incorporation
of
added
substrate
into
intracellular
storage
compounds
Wagner
and
Loy
2002
which
can
not
be
monitored
with
SIP
techniques
On
the
other
hand
FISH-MAR
is
limited
by
the
availability
and
affordability
of
radiolabelled
substrates
As
with
SIP
synthesizing
complex
organic
compounds
is
challenging
and
requires
safety
precautions
because
of
the
radioactive
label
Alternatively
heterotrophic
growth
can
be
studied
by
incubating
environmental
samples
with
an
unlabelled
substrate
in
the
presence
of
14CO2
Hesselsoe
et
al
2005
Because
heterotrophic
organisms
assimilate
CO2
during
growth
under
aerobic
and
anaerobic
conditions
this
approach
HetCO2-MAR
is
affordable
and
has
the
convenience
of
using
the
same
labelled
compound
for
assessing
growth
on
multiple
substrates
Such
an
approach
has
been
demonstrated
for
pure
cultures
and
filamentous
'Candidatus
Microthrix
parvicella
in
activated
sludge
under
different
electron
donor/acceptor
combinations
Hesselsoe
et
al
2005
If
HetCO2-MAR
is
used
as
a
discovery
tool
it
is
important
to
remember
that
not
only
heterotrophic
substrate-consuming
but
also
all
active
autotrophic
microorganisms
will
be
labelled
The
latter
can
be
avoided
by
addition
of
specific
inhibitors
Wagner
et
al
2006
Drawbacks
of
FISH-MAR
are
its
restriction
to
environments
amenable
to
FISH
and
a
requirement
for
some
prior
empirical
knowledge
of
the
organisms
that
are
likely
to
assimilate
a
radioactively
labelled
carbon
source
Without
specific
probes
targeting
active
populations
only
higher
level
phylogenetic
assignments
for
example
by
using
the
ever-expanding
collection
of
phyla-specific
probes
Loy
et
al
2007
of
the
detected
radioactive
cells
may
be
possible
To
achieve
higher
phylogenetic
resolution
SIP
has
been
used
to
complement
FISH-MAR
by
identifying
putative
key
players
before
identifying
active
populations
on
an
individual
cell
basis
Combining
SIP
with
FISH-MAR
has
thus
far
been
demonstrated
with
denitrifying
communities
in
wastewater
that
use
methanol
or
acetate
as
carbon
sources
Ginige
et
al
2004
2005
In
both
cases
probes
designed
against
predominant
phylotypes
in
the
13C-labelled
SIP
DNA
successfully
targeted
radioactive
cells
with
FISH-MAR
These
results
support
SIP
as
a
method
for
identifying
environmentally
relevant
phylotypes
and
highlight
the
utility
of
combining
SIP
and
FISH-MAR
for
linking
phylogeny
and
function
in
a
focussed
and
logical
approach
If
dealing
with
uncultured
microorganisms
microbial
ecologists
in
most

The
isotope
array
The
isotope
array
is
a
powerful
method
that
offers
a
level
of
throughput
not
readily
afforded
by
FISH-MAR
or
SIP
techniques
Adamczyk
et
al
2003
and
should
become
a
useful
tool
for
any
environment
that
yields
sufficient
RNA
for
direct
hybridization
After
incubating
samples
with
a
radioactive
substrate
RNA
is
extracted
fluorescently
labelled
and
hybridized
to
rRNA
probes
in
a
microarray
format
Subsequently
the
microarray
is
analysed
with
a
fluorescence
scanner
and
beta
microimager
to
reveal
microbial
community
composition
and
to
identify
substrate-consuming
community
members
respectively
The
applicability
of
this
approach
to
complex
samples
was
shown
by
Adamczyk
et
al
2003
who
designed
a
simple
prototype
array
to
monitor
14C-bicarbonate
incorporation
into
the
lithoautotrophic
ammonia-oxidizers
of
activated
sludge
They
indicated
that
the
main
advantages
of
the
isotope
array
was
the
direct
detection
of
labelled
RNA
from
active
organisms
without
the
potential
to
detect
unlabelled
background
as
can
occur
with
DNA-
and
RNA-SIP
For
exploiting
the
full
potential
of
the
isotope
array
approach
it
would
be
best
combined
with
encompassing
phylochips
Loy
et
al
2005
or
even
high-density
DNA
microarrays
Brodie
et
al
2007
but
at
least
the
latter
option
will
have
to
await
the
development
of
beta
microimagers
with
higher
spatial
resolution
However
even
if
microarrays
with
larger
spot
sizes
are
applied
the
isotope
array
approach
should
be
ideally
suited
to
decipher
microbial
food
webs
in
complex
microbial
communities
by
performing
experiments
at
different
time
points
after
incubation
of
the
sample
with
the
labelled
substrate

Other
techniques
in
development
Raman
microscopy
and
its
combination
with
FISH
Raman
confocal
microscopy
employs
an
excitation
laser
incident
on
samples
to
measure
the
vibrational
energy
of
chemical
bonds
The
scattered
laser
light
is
captured
by
a
charge-coupled
device
camera
and
a
spectrum
is
obtained
that
has
discernable
peaks
for
different
biological
molecules
in
the
cell
When
tested
on
single
microbial
cells
the
peaks
in
the
Raman
spectra
corresponding
to
phenylalanine
proteins
and
nucleic
acids
were
'red-shifted
by
the
incorporation
of
13C-labelled
substrate
Huang
et
al
2004
The
magnitude
of
this
red
shift
was
independent
of
bacterial
species
tested
and
corresponded
to
the
proportion
of
label
Nucleic
acids
with
only
20

incorporation
were
clearly
discernable
from
100
12C-fed

As
the
optical
resolution
of
Raman
microscopy
approx1
mum
is
similar
to
that
of
FISH
the
two
methods
are
conceivably
complementary
As
Raman
microscopy
detects
stable-isotope
incorporation
into
cellular
constituents
this
would
offer
a
possible
advantage
over
FISH-MAR
by
obviating
the
need
to
handle
radioisotopes
and
facilitates
the
somewhat
cumbersome
quantification
of
silver
grains
Furthermore
and
in
contrast
to
FISH-MAR
Raman
provides
information
into
which
cellular
compounds
the
labelled
substrate
was
incorporated
Recently
FISH
and
Raman
confocal

have
been
directly
combined

confirm
the

As
already
achieved
for
Raman-FISH
a
combination
of
FISH-nanoSIMS
would
enable
phylogenetic
and
isotopic
analysis
of
an

Furthermore
it

performed
after
the
addition
of
stable-isotope

Such
an
exciting

would
provide
high-throughput

Owing

Conclusions
Isotope-based
techniques
have
become
firmly
established
in
international
microbial
ecology
research
Their
relative
ease-of-use
and
unparalleled
ability
to
link
the
structure
and
function
of
uncultivated
organisms
enables
long
unanswered
questions
to
be
addressed
with
creative
experimentation
As
discovery
science
becomes
increasingly
complemented
with
hypothesis-driven
research
we
anticipate
learning
vastly
more
about
who
eats
what
where
and
when
Microbial
communities
are
foundational
to
almost
all
aspects
of
nutrient
cycling
in
the
natural
environment
Learning
more
about
the
metabolic
contributions
of
bacteria
Archaea
and
microbial
Eukarya
will
shed
increasingly
more
light
on
their
behaviour
as
single
cells
populations
and
communities
As
microbial
ecologists
focus
on
issues
of
global
importance
we
anticipate
that
isotopic
techniques
can
and
will
continue
to
catalyse
good
science
and
innovative
research
Such
investigations
elucidate
the
possibilities
and
limits
of
anaerobic
bioremediation
and
deepen
our
understanding
of
microbial
processes
in
sediments
and
oil
fields
Another
important
outcome
is
the
recognition
of
novel
reaction
mechanisms
that
are
unprecedented
in
biochemistry
and
that
might
be
of
heuristic
value
for
biomimetic
approaches
to
the
development
of
catalysts
It
is
true
that
a
variety
of
catalysts
and
chemical
reactions
are
successfully
applied
in
petrochemistry
However
chemically
catalysed
reactions
of
hydrocarbons
are
usually
of
low
specificity
and
not
suited
to
the
efficient
synthesis
of
pure
substances
whereas
biological
hydrocarbon
activation
and
subsequent
reactions
are
specific
On
the
other
hand
biological
alkane
activation
especially
under

the
rate
for
pure

be

factor
of

The
unique
mechanistic
aspects
of
the
anaerobic
biological
activation
of
hydrocarbons
especially
of
alkanes
become
evident
if
compared
with
known
chemical
or
aerobic
biological
reactions
The
formation
of
functionalized
products
from
alkanes
as
the
least
reactive
hydrocarbons
requires
very
harsh
conditions

a
few
examples

demonstrate
Alkanes
can
be

by
highly

radicals
such
a
e.g.

of
Cl2

e.g.
from
H2O2
and
Fe2+
the
formed
alkyl
radicals
undergo
further
reactions
often
chain
reactions
leading
to
chlorinated
or
functionalized
products
respectively
108
Among
ionic
mechanisms

of

attention

Since
the
1970s
an
increasing
number
of
transition
metal
complexes
have
been
shown
to
react
with
the
C–H
bonds
of
alkanes
In
comprehensive
presentations
of
the
subject
high-valent
and
low-valent
metal
complexes
have
been
distinguished
110.
111..
Reactions
with
metal
complexes
can
also
lead
to
functionalized
products
Functionalization
usually
involves
a
strong
oxidant
such
as
a
high-valent
metal
complex
with
an
oxygen
atom
as
ligand
or
requires
another
‘
driving
force
’
such
as
light
in
the
carbonylation
of
alkanes
to
aldehydes
with
a
low-valent
metal
e.g.
rhodium
complex
Monooxygenases
the
biological
catalysts

formal
oxidation
states
of
Fe
IV
or
Fe
V
110.
111.
112..
The
active
oxygen
atom
is
formed
by
partial
reduction
and
cleavage
of
O2
bound
to
an
Fe
centre
which
may
be
mononuclear
P450
and
other
monooxygenases
or
dinuclear
methane
monooxygenase
The
oxygen
atom
either
abstracts
a
hydrogen
atom
from
the
alkane
with
subsequent
reaction
of
H
radical
with
the
alkyl
radical
to
form
the
alcohol
rebound
mechanism
or
inserts
directly
into
the
C–H
bond
to
yield
the
alcohol
the
assumption
of
the
latter
mechanism
is
favoured
in
the
case
of
methane
Bacteria
that
oxidize
alkanes
anaerobically
live
at
normal
temperatures
often
in
reducing
e.g.
sulphidic
environments
where
no
agents
with
oxidizing
properties
similar
to
those
of
oxygen
species
or
high
oxidation
states
of
iron
III
can
be
generated
These
bacteria
must
nonetheless
harbor
enzymes
with
‘
harsh
’
and/or
catalytically
unique
reaction
centres
to
overcome
the
sluggishness
of
the
substrate
Despite
this
the
initial
activation
step
must
not
be
energetically
expensive
In
particular
methane-oxidizing
consortia
and
sulphate-reducers
or
syntrophs
in
association
with
methanogens
gain
little
energy
from
the
overall
reactions
and
therefore
can
not
dissipate
much
energy
for
substrate
activation
From
this
point
of
view
the
radical
mechanism
involving
fumarate
appears
an
elegant
solution
for
several
types
of
hydrocarbons
Fig
6
and
even
for
polar
aromatic
compounds
with
methyl
groups
The
overall
reaction
of
hydrocarbon
addition
to
fumarate
is
clearly
in
favour
of
the
product
ΔG0∼−30
kJ
mol−1
but
is
by
no
means
extremely
exergonic
‘
dissipative
’
like
alkane
activation
with
O2
e.g.
C3H8
O2
NADH
H+
→
C3H7OH
H2O
NAD+
ΔG=−371
kJ
mol−1
The
anaerobic
oxidation
of
methane
with
sulphate
with
its
very
low
net
energy
gain
may
require
an
initial
reaction
that
is
even
less
exergonic
than
that
of
higher
alkanes
or
might
need
coupling
to
an
energy-conserving
mechanism
and
thus
may
have
to
operate
close
to
equilibrium
This
postulate
is
in
favour
of
an
activation
that
is
or
resembles
a
reversal
of
methanogenesis
The
final
step
in
methanogenesis
is
thought
to
be
the
liberation
of
CH4
from
a
Ni
II
–CH3
centre
by
protonation
16
Even
if
there
are
arguments
against
an
exact
reversal
of
this
mechanism—of
methane
deprotonation
hypothetical
pKa
value
is
as
high
as
48
108
—a
nickel
centre
or
the
same
nickel
centre
as
in
the
formation
of
methane
may
be
involved
This
type
of
methane
activation
would
be
the
biological
equivalent
of
the
chemical
alkane
activation
with
a
low-valent
metal
complex
see
above
In
analogy
with
the
activation
of
H2
by
hydrogenase
which
has
almost
the
same
bond
energy
as
the
C–H
bond
in
methane
but
can
be
readily
activated
due
to
the
non-directed
H–H
bond
112
such
a
methane-activating
enzyme
would
deserve
the
designation
methanase
It
will
be
interesting
to
compare
the
subsequent
reactions
of
the
activated
methyl
group
with
those
in
methanogenesis

Anaerobic
biodegradation
of
saturated
and
aromatic
hydrocarbons
Abstract
Saturated
and
aromatic
hydrocarbons
are
wide-spread
in
our
environment
These
compounds
exhibit
low
chemical
reactivity
and
for
many
decades
were
thought
to
undergo
biodegradation
only
in
the
presence
of
free
oxygen
During
the
past
decade
however
an
increasing
number
of
microorganisms
have
been
detected
that
degrade
hydrocarbons
under
strictly
anoxic
conditions
Introduction
Compounds
that
consist
exclusively
of
carbon
and
hydrogen
are
termed
hydrocarbons
Because
of
the
lack
of
functional
groups
hydrocarbons
are
largely
apolar
and
exhibit
low
chemical
reactivity
at
room
temperature
Differences
in
their
reactivities
are
primarily
determined
by
the
occurrence
type
and
arrangement
of
unsaturated
bonds
π-bonds
It
is
therefore
common
to
classify
hydrocarbons
according
to
their
bonding
features
into
four
groups
the
alkanes
saturated
hydrocarbons
alkenes
alkynes
and
aromatic
hydrocarbons
Within
each
of
the
groups
of
non-aromatic
aliphatic
hydrocarbons
we
can
further
distinguish
between
straight-chain
e.g.
n-alkanes
branched-chain
and
cyclic
alicyclic
compounds
Aromatic
hydrocarbons
may
be
mono-
or
polycyclic
and
many
important
compounds
in
this
class
also
contain
aliphatic
hydrocarbon
chains
e.g.
alkylbenzenes
The
availability
of
hydrocarbons
as
fuels
and
starting
compounds
for
a
vast
range
of
chemical
syntheses
is
of
fundamental
importance
for
our
industrialised
civilisation
Nearly
all
of
these
hydrocarbons
are
of
natural
origin
or
chemically
synthesised
directly
from
natural
hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbons
are
naturally
formed
by
long-term
geochemical
reactions
of
buried
biomass
or
as
metabolites
in
living
organisms
Hence
anthropogenic
activity
has
not
introduced
hydrocarbons
as
a
novel
class
of
compounds
into
the
environment
but
rather
led
to
an
increase
in
their
accumulation
this
can
be
deleterious
as
in
the
case
of
oil
spills

The
presence
of
hydrocarbons
in
the
biosphere
throughout
the
history
of
life
may
explain
why
many
microorganisms
have
acquired
pathways
to
make
use
of
these
compounds
as
growth
substrates
Fig

The
study
of
such
microorganisms
is
of
basic
scientific
e.g.
biochemical
environmental
and
biotechnological
interest
Bacteria
and
fungi
that
utilise
hydrocarbons
in
the
presence
of
oxygen
have
been
known
since
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
The
fact
that
oxygen
is
not
available
in
all
environments
where
hydrocarbons
occur
e.g.
in
deep
sediments
and
in
oil
reservoirs
has
repeatedly
evoked
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
biodegradation
of
hydrocarbons
is
possible
under
anoxic
conditions
and
if
so
to
what
extent
It
was
not
until
the
late
1980s
that
novel
types
of
microorganisms
were
definitively
shown
to
degrade
hydrocarbons
under
strictly
anoxic
conditions
Fig
1
So
far
studies
have
shown
that
these
microorganisms
activate
hydrocarbons
by
unprecedented
biochemical
mechanisms
that
differ
completely
from
those
employed
in
aerobic
hydrocarbon
metabolism
The
present
article
focuses
on
saturated
and
aromatic
hydrocarbons
which
are
the
main
constituents
of
gas
and
oil

Formation
of
aliphatic
and
aromatic
hydrocarbons
Biological
formation
Among
hydrocarbons
formed
by
living
organisms
one
may
distinguish
between
compounds
with
assumed
protective
or
other
advantageous
functions
and
degradation
products
mostly
from
energy
metabolism
i.e.
‘
exhaust
’
products
The
majority
of
biogenic
hydrocarbons
of
the
first
category
are
alkenes
and
include
the
enormous
variety
of
monoterpenes
found
in
higher
plants
monoterpenes
may
function
as
deterrents
inhibitors
of
fungal
or
bacterial
growth
or
attractants
but
often
their
role
is
unknown
Saturated
and
aromatic
hydrocarbons
may
also
have
an
advantageous
function
in
living
organisms
Various
n-alkanes
or
simple
methyl-branched
alkanes
have
been
detected
in
bacteria
plants
6
and
animals
Highly
methyl-branched
alkanes
derived
from
isoprene
units
are
common
in
archaea
9
One
may
speculate
that
certain
alkanes
stabilise
lipid
membranes
or
increase
the
water-repelling
effect
of
protective
waxes
The
biosynthesis
of
alkanes
is
poorly
understood
The
predominance
of
C-odd
chains
among
n-alkanes
suggests
synthesis
from
common
C-even
fatty
acids
by
loss
of
the
carboxyl
group
However
simple
decarboxylation
of
a
saturated
fatty
acid
is
very
unlikely
from
a
mechanistic
point
of
view
1-Alkene
biosynthesis
from
saturated
fatty
acids
by
hydrogen
and
carboxyl
group
elimination
in
an
aerobic
radical
mechanism
has
been
demonstrated
10
Alkane
formation
by
subsequent
saturation
of
the
non-activated
double
bond
would
again
be
difficult
to
explain
on
the
basis
of
known
enzyme
mechanisms
On
the
other
hand
it
has
been
suggested
that
alkanes
R–H
in
plants
are
produced
from
aldehydes
R–CH=O
from
fatty
acid
reduction
via
hydrogen-atom
abstraction
decarbonylation
of
the
acyl
radicals
and
the
readdition
of
hydrogen
by
involvement
of
a
cobalt
tetrapyrrole
11
The
occurrence
of
such
a
cofactor
in
plants
would
be
unique
the
only
known
cobalt
tetrapyrrole
coenzyme
B12
has
otherwise
never
been
detected
in
plants

By
far
the
most
important
hydrocarbon
among
biological
degradation
products
is
methane
There
is
much
debate
about
a
biological
versus
geochemical
origin
of
methane
in
various
reservoirs
3
Biological
origin
is
evident
from
a
low
13C/12C
isotope
ratio
The
globally
most
important
methane
reservoirs
are
presumably
gas
hydrates
from
their
estimated
volumes
a
content
of
around
10×1012
tonnes
carbon
can
be
calculated
Biological
methane
is
produced
by
diverse
strictly
anaerobic
archaea
They
utilise
acetate
and
biogenic
C1
compounds
methanol
methylamines
and
methylsulphides
that
undergo
net-dismutation
reactions
or
CO2
that
is
reduced
with
H2
or
other
hydrogen
donors
from
fermentation
processes
Via
fermentative
syntrophic
and
methanogenic
microorganisms
biomass
can
in
principle
be
completely
converted
to
methane
and
CO2
9
The
process
as
a
whole
can
be
viewed
as
a
gradual
defunctionalisation
and
dismutation
of
the
original
biomolecules
Reactions
continue
until
the
final
thermodynamically
stable
states
of
carbon
are
reached
in
the
form
of
methane
and
CO2

Methanogenic
communities
thus
obtain
the
maximum
free
energy
available
from
carbon
compounds
in
the
absence
of
external
electron
acceptors
Even
aromatic
or
saturated
hydrocarbons
can
be
converted
by
microbial
associations
to
methane
The
formation
of
ethane
and
higher
gaseous
alkanes
from
natural
or
added
ethyl
compounds
or
higher
alkyl
compounds
respectively
has
been
observed
in
natural
microbial
communities
and
in
cultures
of
methanogens
however
these
hydrocarbons
were
only
found
in
trace
concentrations
Aromatic
hydrocarbons
can
also
be
formed
as
biological
degradation
products
Tolumonasauensis
converts
phenylacetate
produced
from
the
fermentative
breakdown
of
phenylalanine
during
mixotrophic

to
toluene

This
reaction
is
formally
a
decarboxylation
but
the
mechanism
is
not
understood
The
anaerobic
production
of
p-cymene
from
alkenoic
and
oxygen-containing
monoterpenes
under
conditions
of
methanogenesis
provides
another
example
of
the
biological
formation
of
an
aromatic
hydrocarbon
from
degradation
reactions
25
Geochemical
formation
Saturated
and
aromatic
hydrocarbons
are
formed
over
geological
periods
by
the
reactions
of
buried
biomass
especially
in
marine
sediments
Locally
intense
hydrocarbon
production
has
led
to
the
formation
of
oil
and
gas
accumulations
3
Saturated
and
aromatic
hydrocarbons
comprise
on
average
∼80
by
mass
of
oil
constituents
The
organic
carbon
in
estimated
oil
reserves
3
amounts
to
∼0.23×1012
tonnes
of
carbon
The
geochemical
transformation
processes
leading
to
the
formation
of
hydrocarbons
are
extremely
complex
and
the
literature
in
the
field
of
organic
geochemistry
should
be
consulted
for
details
Early
defunctionalisation
and
condensation
reactions
of
sedimented
and
buried
biomass
at
moderate
temperature
termed
diagenesis
sometimes
including
biodegradative
reactions
lead
to
the
formation
of
structurally
highly
complex
polymers
designated
kerogen
Kerogen
in
sediments
of
various
ages
is
by
far
the
most
abundant
form
of
organic
carbon
on
our
planet
The
total
mass
of
kerogen
corresponds
to
greater
than
1015
tonnes
of
carbon
3
this
is
much
more
than
the
amount
that
could
reduce
all
of
the
free
oxygen
on
our
planet
Reactions
at
higher
temperature
and
pressure
termed
katagenesis
increase
the
hydrophobic
character
of
kerogen
by
further
defunctionalisation
and
release
parts
of
the
organic
carbon
as
aliphatic
and
aromatic
hydrocarbons
High-temperature
and
high-pressure
reactions
at
deep
sites
termed
metagenesis
finally
lead
to
the
production
of
methane
and
CO2
and/or
to
native
carbon
In
conclusion
organic
carbon
from
geochemical
transformation
also
approaches
its
energetically
final
state
but
this
happens
via
reactions
that
are
far
less
specific
less
complete
and
much
slower
than
those
of
anaerobic
microbial
processes
An
important
difference
between
microbial
and
geochemical
carbon
transformation
is
the
pronounced
production
in
the
latter
process
of
chemically
sluggish
numerous
non-methane
hydrocarbons
as
a
‘
pre-final
’
metastable
state
Fig

Still
there
is
the
open
question
as
to
whether
or
not
microorganisms
are
involved
in
the
production
of
some
non-methane
hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbon-degrading
anaerobic
bacteria
and
their
activation
mechanisms
In
aerobic
bacteria
growing
on
hydrocarbons
O2
is
not
only
the
terminal
electron
acceptor
for
respiratory
energy
conservation
but
also
an
indispensable
reactant
in
the
activation
mechanism
By
the
action
of
monooxygenases
on
aliphatic
and
certain
aromatic
hydrocarbons
or
dioxygenases
on
aromatic
hydrocarbons
one
or
two
oxygen
atoms
respectively
are
directly
incorporated
from
O2
leading
to
hydroxylated
products
The
realisation
that
enzymatically
activated
oxygen
as
a
strong
oxidant
is
used
to
overcome
the
chemical
sluggishness
of
hydrocarbons
has
for
some
decades
favoured
the
view
that
hydrocarbons
are
not
biodegradable
under
anoxic
conditions
However
since
the
late
1980s
an
increasing
number
of
novel
microorganisms
have
been
shown
to
utilise
saturated
and
aromatic
hydrocarbons
as
growth
substrates
under
strictly
anoxic
conditions
These
microorganisms
use
nitrate
ferric
iron
or
sulphate
as
electron
acceptors
for
anaerobic
respiration
grow
in
syntrophic
cocultures
with
other
anaerobes
or
grow
by
anoxygenic
photosynthesis

Methane
the
smallest
and
most
stable
hydrocarbon
is
oxidized
by
archaea
in
a
syntrophic
association
with
sulphate-reducing
bacteria
SRB
There
is
no
biochemical
agent
under
anoxic
conditions
that
exhibits
the
properties
of
the
oxygen
species
involved
in
aerobic
hydrocarbon
activation
hence
the
mechanisms
of
anaerobic
hydrocarbon
activation
have
to
be
completely
different
from
oxygenase
reactions
Indeed
all
of
the
anaerobic
activation
reactions
of
hydrocarbons
are
mechanistically
unprecedented
in
biochemistry
Methane
In
marine
sediments
methane
diffusing
upwards
from
deep
zones
often
disappears
long
before
any
contact
with
oxygen
is
possible
This
anaerobic
methane
consumption
is
accompanied
by
sulphate
reduction
to
sulphide
at
distinct
rates
Residual
methane
is
13C-enriched
again
indicating
biological
consumption
31
In
addition
inorganic
carbon
CO2
HCO3−
CO32−
in
the
zone
of
methane
depletion
is
relatively
depleted
in
13C
31
this
suggests
that
CO2
from
the
oxidation
of
isotopically
light
methane
dilutes
the
isotopically
heavier
background
of
inorganic
carbon
Upon
addition
of
14C-labelled
methane
to
anoxic
marine
sediment
the
formation
of
radioactive
CO2
could
be
measured
30.
31.
To
date
no
microorganism
has
been
isolated
that
carries
out
a
net
oxidation
of
methane
with
electron
acceptors
other
than
O2
A
partial
conversion
of
14CH4
to
14CO2
during
the
net
production
of
methane
has
been
measured
in
cultures
of
methanogenic
archaea
suggesting
a
certain
reversibility
of
methanogenesis
Studies
with
marine
sediment
led
to
the
conclusion
that
anaerobic
oxidation
of
methane
is
mediated
in
a
consortium
of
archaea
and
SRB
with
the
former
converting
methane
to
CO2
and
H2
and
the
latter
scavenging
H2
by
oxidation
with
sulphate
32
The
assumption
that
such
consortia
exist
was
further
supported
by
the
discovery
of
specific
strongly
13C-depleted
lipids
and
lipid-associated
compounds
such
as
crocetane
2,6,11,15-tetramethylhexadecane
in
the

of
anaerobic

In
addition
16S
rRNA
gene
sequences
retrieved
from
this

indicated
the
presence
of
a
distinct
group
of
the
Methanosarcinales
Furthermore

exhibited
close
relationships
to
Methanosarcinales
and
sulphate-reducers
of
the
Desulfosarcina
branch
δ-Proteobacteria
respectively
The
volume-related
anaerobic
methane
oxidation
rate
in
the
studied
gas
hydrate
area
up
to
5×10−3mol

was
high
in
comparison
to

in
many
other

such

do
not
easily
offer
an
explanation
for

of

methanol
would
be
at

as
problematic
to
account
for
the
observed

It
is
true
that
formate
as
electron
donor
is
regarded
as
energetically
nearly
equivalent
to
H2
However
their
standard
states
underlying
such
energetic
calculations
are
different
The
standard
state
of
H2
is
101Pa
1
atm
which
is
in
equilibrium
with
dissolved
concentrations
of
∼1
mM
The
standard
state
of
formate
is
the
dissolved
state
with
an
activity
of
1
corresponding
to
approximately
1
M.
Hence
formate
concentrations
can
be
significantly
higher
depending
on
the
CO2/HCO3–
concentration
than
energetically
equivalent
dissolved
hydrogen
concentrations
and
thus
an
attractive
explanation
is
that
formate
acts
as
a
shuttle
for
carrying
reducing
equivalents
between
syntrophic
partners
In
the
case
of
the
consortia
one
would
have
to
explain
how
formate
can
be
formed
by
Methanosarcinales
despite
the
fact
that
none
of
the
members
of
this
group
is
able
to
utilize
this
compound
The

Conclusions
Non-methane
alkanes
Since
the
1940s
the
possibility
of
an
anaerobic
oxidation
of
alkanes
of
various
chain
lengths
has
been
repeatedly
examined
to
understand
the
geochemically
important
and
economically
undesirable
process
of
bacterial
sulphate
reduction
in
oil
reservoirs
and
during
oil
production
Alkanes
as
major
oil
constituents
were
regarded
as
potential
electron
donors
and
carbon
sources
for
SRB
In
addition
possible
anaerobic
reactions
of
alkanes
were
studied
in
connection
with
biochemical
investigations
of
aerobic
alkane-utilizing
microorganisms
Before
the
monooxygenase
reaction
was
generally
accepted
as
the
initial
step
of
aerobic
alkane
degradation
an
oxygen-independent
dehydrogenation
to
1-alkenes
with
subsequent
epoxidation
or
hydration
of
the
double
bond
was
suggested
as
an
alternative
mechanism
the
latter
reaction
sequence
would
theoretically
offer
the
possibility
for
anaerobic
alkane
utilization
Later
however
anaerobic
growth
of
the
formerly
investigated
species
and
anaerobic
alkane
dehydrogenation
could
not
be
repeated
or
was
viewed
critically
The
anaerobic
degradation
of
alkanes
with
sulphate
or
nitrate
was
first
demonstrated
by
the
quantitative
measurement
of
substrate
consumption
with
novel
isolates
that
differed
from
any
known
species
Furthermore
alkane
degradation
by
methanogenic
communities
was

Fatty
acid
analysis
in
two
SRB
led
to
the
assumption
that
anaerobic
alkane
activation
occurs
by
the
addition
of
a
carbon
compound
a
C1
compound
in
one
initial
hypothesis
and
that
the
site
in
the
alkane
chain
for
such
addition
may
not
be
the
same
in
different
species
44
The
reaction
of
C
addition
was
further
supported
by
labelling
studies
showing
that
the
methyl
group
in
branched
fatty
acids
formed
upon
growth
with
n-alkanes
originated
from
the
terminal
carbon
of
the
substrate
In
a
denitrifying
bacterium
with
the
capacity
for
alkane
degradation
one
of
the
proteins
that
was
specifically
formed
during
growth
on
n-hexane
exhibited
N-terminal
sequence
similarity
with
the
small
subunit
BssC
of
the
anaerobic
toluene-activating
enzyme

These
results
suggested
that
alkane
activation
might
have
a
similar
mechanism
to
that
of
toluene
activation
which
involves
fumarate
and
yields
the
substituted
succinate
benzylsuccinate
Indeed
substituted
succinates
with
alkane-derived
alkyl
chains
were
detected
in
a
sulphate-reducing
enrichment
culture
and
a
denitrifying
strain
growing
with
n-dodecane
or
n-hexane
respectively
The
inclusion
of
authentic
standards
and
labelling
studies
clearly
indicated
that
n-hexane
was
activated
at
carbon-2
in
connection
with
an
addition
to
fumarate
yielding
1-methylpentyl
succinate

formation
of
some

the
alkane

carbon-3
Interestingly
the
alkylsuccinates
occurred
as
two
diastereomers
The
formation
of
stereoisomers
is
exceptional
among
enzymatic
reactions
Assuming
that
the
reaction
with
fumarate
is
stereoselective
as
in
toluene
activation
see
below
the
formation
of
the
stereoisomers
may
be
due
to
relaxed
stereospecificity
at
the
alkane
carbon
this
suggests
that
the
diastereomers
are
nonracemic
Furthermore
electron-paramagnetic
resonance
EPR
spectroscopy
showed
the
presence
of
an
organic
radical
possibly
a
glycyl
radical
in
n-hexane-grown
cells
but
not
in
n-hexanoate-grown
cells
This
further
supports
the
idea
that
alkane
activation
resembles
in
principle
anaerobic
toluene
activation
which
most
likely
involves
a
glycyl
radical

scheme
is

The
energy

during

of

is
33kJmol–1
higher
than
in
the
case
of

Conclusions
The
biochemistry
of
the
further
degradation
of
alkylsuccinates
has
not
been
elucidated
but
is
expected
to
lead
to
fatty
acid
metabolism
44.
If
different
alkylsuccinates
are
further
degraded
by
analogous
mechanisms
the
fatty
acids
derived
from
alkanes
activated
at
carbon-2
should
differ
by
one
carbon
atom
from
fatty
acids
derived
from
alkanes
activated
at
carbon-3
the
activation
energy
would
be
rather
similar
Hence
different
fatty
acid
profiles
in
some
SRB
grown
on
the
same
alkane
may
result
from
different
sites
of
initial
attack
44.
The
only
other
comparable
anaerobic
activation
re-action
is
that
used
for
the
synthesis
of
diabolic
acid
15,16-dimethyltriacontanedioic
acid
a
component
of
the
lipid
fraction
in
Butyrivibrio
fibriosolvens
The
underlying
mechanism
has
been
suggested
to
comprise
a
simultaneous
homolytic
C–H
cleavage
at
the
subterminal
carbon
of
two
palmitate
molecules
by
a
B12
enzyme
followed
by
condensation
of
the
radical-carrying
chains
51
This
reaction
involves
a
net

of
two
hydrogen
atoms

form
of

The

of
anaerobic

has
provided
important
clues
as
to
our
understanding
of
anaerobic

from

Anaerobic

the

for
the

of
the

toluene
and
other
hydrocarbons
It
could
be
shown
that
benzylsuccinate
was
not
a
by-product
but
the
initial
intermediate
formed
from
toluene
and

The
activating
enzymes
of
PFL
and
RNR
generate
the
glycyl
radical
via
cleavage
of
S-adenosylmethionine
by
one-electron
reduction
yielding
methionine
and
an
adenosyl
radical
the
adenosyl
radical
abstracts
a
hydrogen
atom
from
a
glycine
residue
leading
to
the
formation
of
a
glycyl
radical
i.e.
H-CO-
in
the
polypeptide
chain
The
glycyl
radical
is
supposed
to
be
a
storage
radical

then
generates
a

Benzylsuccinate

somewhat
in
analogy
to
the
β-oxidation
of
fatty

to
acetyl-CoA
and
benzoyl-CoA
74.
Benzoyl-CoA
undergoes
reductive
dearomatization
and
ring
cleavage
followed
by
reactions
that
again
resemble
those
in
the
β-oxidation
of

The

p-isopropyltoluene

There
is
evidence
that

to
that
of

Further
degradation
of

would
be
possible
by
reactions
analogous
to
those

upon

the

groups
would
prevent
one
round
of

β-oxidation

thus
require

not
bioremediation
processes
are
possible
in
deep
anoxic
petroleum-contaminated
or
fuel-contaminated
sediments
and
aquifers
A
basic
idea
for
augmented
bioremediation
is
to
make
electron
acceptors
in
injected
water
available
at
concentrations
higher
than
that
of
dissolved
oxygen
from

The
concentration
of

air-saturated
water
8.6mg/L

25°C

the
capacity

of
sulphate
with
low
solubility
with
a
saturation
concentration
corresponding
to

Aromatic

concern
because
of

properties
in

case
of

100
There
is
no
doubt
that
the
degradation
of
petroleum

refined
products
is
much
faster
under
oxic
than
anoxic
conditions

can
be
easily
demonstrated
in

Furthermore
aerobic
microorganisms
seem
to
degrade
a
wider
range
of
hydrocarbon
compounds
than
anaerobic
microorganisms
Still
an
argument
in
support
of
the
development
of
anaerobic
bioremediation
procedures
is
the
observation
that
benzene

Alkanes

little

apart
from

Nevertheless
the
degradation
of

that

increase

estimated
from
the

as
well
as
that
of

buried
with
sediments
may
have
died
due
to
substrate
limitations
or
high
temperature
during
catagenesis
also
extremely
high
salt
concentrations
may
limit
the
diversity
of
bacteria
that
can
develop
in
stratal
waters
On
the
other
hand
there
are
assumptions
that
anaerobic
bacteria
deposited
with
the
original
sediments
have
survived
millions
of
years
such
survival
appears
unlikely
without
a
slow
more
or
less
constant
supply
of
substrates
by
migration
processes
over
geological
periods
101
In
any
case
suitable
growth
conditions
for
hydrocarbon-degrading
anaerobes
are
likely
to
be
established
by
the
mobilization
of
oil
upon
water
injection
the
introduction
of
sulphate
especially
if
seawater
is
injected
and
the
decrease
of
temperature
and
salinity
The
repeatedly
observed
increase
in
sulphate
reduction
after
the
onset
of
oil
production
may
reflect
the
gradual
spreading
and
growth
of
SRB
Conclusions
The
study
of
the
anaerobic
degradation
of
hydrocarbons
has
brought
to
light
a
variety
of
novel
anaerobic
bacteria
and
degradative
capacities

The
in
situ
metabolism
of
oil-degrading
bacteria
is
likely
to
be
limited
by
a
number
of
environmental
parameters
including
temperature
the
availability
of
oxygen
and
major
nutrients
oil
hydrocarbon
content
and
weathering
or
dispersal
of
the
oil
59
Temperatures
in
this
subtropical
environment
remain
optimal
for
microbial
growth
throughout
the
summer
and
oxygen
profiling
indicates
that
the
Pensacola
Beach
sands
remained
aerobic
throughout
the
study
period
with
oxygen
concentrations
at
all
sampled
depth
90
of
sediment
surface
oxygen
concentration
The
rapid
in
situ
growth
we
observed
after
4
weeks
indicates
that
microbial
cells
had
access
to
the
oil
The
majority
of
our
beach
sand
samples
were
collected
in
the
supratidal
zone
and
the
interstitial
pore
space
of
these
sands
was
not
saturated
with
seawater
Therefore
we
conclude
that
the
growth
of
oil-degrading
communities
was
likely
limited
by
desiccation
and/or
nutrient
depletion
in
the
Pensacola
Beach
sands
we
studied
Desiccation
would
exacerbate
carbon
and
nutrient
depletion
by
shutting
off
the
supply
of
dissolved
substrates
from
inundating
tidal
waters

corroboration
of
previous
work
on
marine
sands
in
the
Gulf

we
observed
that
Pensacola

contain
highly

are
predominated
by
members
of
the

The
consensus
of
studies
conducted
in
oil-contaminated
marine
environments
points
to
a
succession
of
bacterial
populations
associated
with
the
early
stages
of
contamination

the
initial
utilization

The

along
with

shows
that

points
to

the

in
the

A
shift
toward
the
Rhodobacteraceae
and
Gram-positive

may
indicate
that
a
succession
has
begun
in

toward
microbial

As
with
other

the
taxonomy
of
hydrocarbon

Of
those
that
have

most

has
been
largely
characterized

effective
for
range
finding
and
for

many

as
we
have
done
here
However
these
should
be
considered

preliminary
and
they
require

in

A
further

be
crucial

Conclusions.The
quantitative
increase
in

the

taxa
and
the

confirmed
the
strong

of
indigenous
bacterial
communities
in
Pensacola
Beach
sands
to
the
presence
of

from
the
DH

We
hypothesize
that
Alcanivorax
spp
of
the
Gammaproteobacteria
are
effective
microbial
indicators
or
sentinels
of
the
early
stages
of
oil
hydrocarbon
degradation
in
Gulf
beach
sands
when
more
reactive
components
such
as
n-alkanes
abound
whereas
members
of
the
Alphaproteobacteria
Labrenzia
and
Rhodobacteraceae
and
Gram-positive
groups
Bacillus
and
Microbacterium
may
be
used
as

for
the
later
stages
of
degradation
when
more
recalcitrant
oil
hydrocarbon
compounds
such
as
PAHs
predominate
In
addition
we
provide
a
number
of
pure
cultures
from
these
groups
that
may
be
used
as

organisms
to
investigate
the
physiological
ecology
of
hydrocarbon
degraders
in
benthic
habitats
of
the
Gulf

Further
study
is
needed
to
delineate
the
specific
role
for
each
of
these
groups
in
hydrocarbon
degradation
on
contaminated
beaches

was
transported
to
the

where
it
may
have
severe
ecological
and

consequences
The
objectives
of
this
study
were
i
to
identify
and
characterize
predominant
oil-degrading
taxa
that
may
be
used
as

as

to

the
in

of
indigenous

to

in

We

INTRODUCTION
The
blowout
of
the
Deepwater
Horizon
DH
drilling
rig
resulted
in
the
world
's
largest
accidental
release
of
oil
into
the
ocean
in
recorded
history
The
equivalent
volume
of
approximately
4.9
million
barrels
of
light
crude
oil
were
discharged
into
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
from
April
to
July
2010
OSAT/NOAA
report

and
oil
budget
calculator

and
the
total
hydrocarbon
discharge
was
40
higher
if
gaseous
hydrocarbons
are
included
34
A
large
amount
of
the
discharged
oil
was
transported
to
the
surface
and
reached
the
shoreline
Although
cleanup
efforts
have
remained
aggressive
a
substantial
portion
of
the
oil
remains
trapped
in
coastal
ecosystems
especially
in
benthic
areas
Permeable
sandy
sediments
cover
large
areas
of
the
seafloor
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
including
beach
ecosystems
Marine
sands
act
as
efficient
biocatalytic
filters
that
play
an
important
role
in
the
biogeochemical
cycles
of
carbon
and
nutrients
in
shallow
Gulf
waters
11

Marine
sands
in
the
Gulf
are
covered
with
biofilms
of
highly
diverse
microbial
communities
30
53
and
the
bacterial
abundance
in
sands
exceeds
that
of
the
overlying
seawater
by
orders
of
magnitude
7
35

Enhanced
porewater
exchange
in
highly
permeable
marine
sands
stimulates
microbial
metabolism
through
the
delivery
of
growth
substrates
and
the
removal
of
waste
products

Similar
to
the
microbially
mediated
breakdown
of
natural
organic
matter
biodegradation
mediated
by
indigenous
microbial
communities
is
the
ultimate
fate
of
the
majority
of
oil
hydrocarbon
that
enters
the
marine
environment
4
42
59
Hydrocarbon-degrading
microorganisms
are
ubiquitous
in
the
marine
environment
27
76
and
biodegradation
was
shown
to
be
successful
in
naturally
remediating
oil
contamination
associated
with
several
spills
that
impacted
shorelines
predominated
by
permeable
marine
sediments
8
46
66
Although
bioremediation
field
trials
were
often
carried
out
there
is
a
paucity
of
information
on
the
indigenous
microbial
communities
that
catalyze
oil
degradation
under
in
situ
conditions
at
spill
sites
2
Even
less
information
is
available
on
which
members
of
the
microbial
community
are
active
in
degrading
hydrocarbons
and
the
impacts
of
various
environmental
parameters
in
controlling
the
activities
of
indigenous
hydrocarbon-degrading
microorganisms
have
not
been
specifically
addressed
Thus
the
theoretical
basis
to
understand
and
predict
the
dynamics
of
hydrocarbon-degrading
microorganisms
in
situ
is
lacking
27
Contamination
of
beach
ecosystems
by
oil
has
the
potential
to
cause
severe
environmental
and
economic
consequences
in
the
Gulf
region
The
risk
of
accidental
oil
discharge
to
the
marine
environment
will
remain
high
for
the
foreseeable
future
since
increased
economic
pressure
to
access
new
oil
reserves
in
deep
marine
waters
will
require
less
tested
technologies
32
Although
technologies
for
oil
drilling
have
advanced
rapidly
in
recent
decades
strategies
to
respond
to
oil
spills
and
to
assess
environmental
impacts
of
oil
contamination
have
lagged
behind
33
An
understanding
of
the
impacts
of
oil
on
indigenous
microbial
communities
and
identification
of
oil-degrading
microbial
groups
are
prerequisite
for
directing
the
management
and
cleanup
of
oil-contaminated
beach
ecosystems
Thus
the
objectives
of
the
present
study
were
i
to
identify
and
interrogate
the
ecophysiology
of
predominant
oil-degrading
taxa
that
may
serve
as
model
organisms
and
microbial
indicators
of
contamination
and
ii
to
characterize
the
in
situ
response
of
indigenous
bacterial
communities
to
oil
contamination
in
Gulf
beach

indicated
substantial
weathering
in
that
the

approximately
18

have
been
shown
to

tested
for
oil

Oil

was
confirmed
from
the

of

and
concomitant
growth
as

consumed
by
the
Vibrio
strain
in

to
killed
control
cultures
and
minimal

was
observed
In

all
of

were
capable
of
rapid

growth
with

oil
as

Gravimetric

indicated
that

The
results
from

DISCUSSION
The
overall
goal
of
our
research
is
to
determine
the
environmental
and
ecological
controls
of
hydrocarbon
biodegradation
under
in
situ
conditions
in
coastal
benthic
environments
impacted
by
the
DH
oil
spill
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
The
oil
degradation
capacity
of
microbial
populations
in
marine
sediments
is
likely
limited
by
stressors
such
as
anoxia
or
nutrient
starvation
as
well
as
ecological
interactions
such
as
mutualistic
production
and
exchange
of
biosurfactants
between
bacterial
populations
27
Knowledge
of
bacterial
community
structure
and
the
response
of
key
microbial
players
in
oil-contaminated
environments
provide
a
first
glance
at
metabolic
potential
and
the
physiological
mechanisms
that
might
drive
hydrocarbon
degradation
Response
of
indigenous
bacterial
communities
to
oil
contamination
in
marine
sands.Microorganisms
with
the
capacity
to
degrade
hydrocarbons
are
among
the
best-studied
microbial
groups
in
applied
and
environmental
microbiology
Indeed
more
than
200
bacterial
algal
and
fungal
genera
encompassing
over
500
species
have
been
recognized
as
capable
of
hydrocarbon
degradation
see
reviews
by
Head
et
al
27
and
Yakimov
et
al
76
Much
progress
has
been
made
to
determine
the
response
of
specific
bacterial
taxa
to
oil
contamination
in
marine
environments
impacted
by
oil
spills
for
reviews

and

However
our
ability
to
understand
and
predict
the
dynamics
of
in
situ
bacterial
communities
responding
to
environmental
stimuli
such
as
the
presence
of
oil
contamination
remains
in
its
infancy
27
60
The
majority
of
previous
work
on
hydrocarbon-degrading
bacterial
communities
in
the
marine
environment
has
been
conducted
under
enrichment
conditions
in
laboratory
microcosms
12
13
45
52
57
69
75
Of
the
fewer
studies
that
have
been
conducted
in
the
field
most
have
focused
on
biostimulation
for
instance
the
application
of
nutrients
to
enhance
oil
bioremediation
46
49
64
68
Thus
a
paucity
of
information
exists
on
the
response
of
indigenous
bacterial
communities
to
oil
contamination
under
in
situ
or
natural
attenuation
conditions

The
DH
oil
spill
disaster
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
has
inspired
a
number
of
studies
that
address
this
knowledge
gap
with
most
of
them
to
date
centered
on
bacterioplankton
communities
of
the
deep
ocean
26
37
70
In
our
study
cultivation-based
and
molecular
enumeration
of
bacterial
communities
showed
a
distinct
impact
of
oil
on
overall
bacterial
numbers
and
specifically
on
the
abundance
of
known
oil
degraders
in
Gulf
beach
sands
Not
surprisingly
bacterial
abundance
increased
as
oil
provides
a
major
source
of
carbon
and
electrons
in
an
otherwise
nutrient-starved
marine
environment
Based
on
an
extensive
molecular
data
set
from
three
field
campaigns
we
show
that
bacteria
in
Pensacola
Beach
sands
were
on
average
2
to
4
orders
of
magnitude
more
abundant
in
the
presence
of
oil
contamination
Fig
2
and
3
and
high
cultivatable
counts
as
well
as
RNA-based
analyses
support
the
premise
that
the
majority
of
bacteria
in
oiled
sands
are
active
These
results
are
consistent
with
past
field
research
on
oiled
beaches
2
46
49
63
We
further
show
that
the
abundance
of
the
known
hydrocarbonoclastic
group
of
Alcanivorax
spp
increased
in
response
to
oil
contamination
and
a
comparison
of
bacterial
ribosome
abundance
in
RNA
extracts
indicated
that
Alcanivorax
abundance
was
proportionately
greater
within
the
active
bacterial
community
data
not
shown
Few
previous
studies
have
applied
quantitative
molecular
approaches
to
determine
the
abundance
of
hydrocarbon
degraders
in
situ
In
a
field
bioremediation
experiment
Singh
et
al
68
reported
an
elevated
abundance
of
Alcanivorax
spp
in
beach
plots
amended
with
oil
plus
fertilizer
but
not
in
plots
treated
with
oil
alone
Oil
began
to
come
ashore
at
Pensacola
Beach
in
early
June
and
we
observed
a
bloom
of
Alcanivorax
spp
and
overall
bacteria
by
early
July
approximately
4
weeks
after
the
initial
oiling
event
Maximum
abundance
was
observed
in
our
aerobic
bacterial
cultures
after
1
to
2
weeks
of
incubation
Thus
our
results
indicate
that
the
native
microbial
communities
in
beach
sands
respond
fairly
quickly
to
oil
contamination
metabolizing
oil
to
support
growth
at
a
rate
which
is
within
a
factor
of
2
to
4
in
comparison
to
pure
cultures
Coupled
with
our
observation
that
oiled
sands
were
depleted
in
low-molecular-weight
aliphatic
and
aromatic
hydrocarbons
the
elevated
abundance
of
hydrocarbon
degraders
provides
an
early
indication
that
natural
attenuation
is
a
viable
strategy
for
the
mitigation
of
oil
contamination
in
Pensacola
Beach
sands
The
proportion
of
Alcanivorax
spp
to
the
total
community
was
lower
at
Pensacola
Beach
in
comparison
to
past
studies
which
used
nutrient
amendments
to
stimulate
biodegradation
Conditions
in
subtropical
sands
temperature
oxygen
supply
and
nutrients
see
below
appear
to
favor
a
broader
diversity
of
hydrocarbon
degraders
that
might
render
biostimulation
unnecessary

Community

with

was
compared
to
sediment
communities
that
did
not
anaerobically
oxidize
benzene
which
were
obtained
from
two
adjacent
Fe
III
-reducing
sites
and
from
methanogenic
and
uncontaminated
zones
Denaturing
gradient
gel
electrophoresis
of
16S
rDNA
sequences
amplified
with
bacterial
or
Geobacteraceae-specific
primers
indicated
significant
differences
in
the
composition
of
the
microbial
communities
at
the
different
sites
Most
notable
was
a
selective
enrichment
of
microorganisms
in
the
Geobacter
cluster
seen
in
the
benzene-degrading
sediments
This
finding
was
in
accordance
with
phospholipid
fatty
acid
analysis
and
most-probable-number–PCR
enumeration
which
indicated
that
members
of
the
family
Geobacteraceae
were
more
numerous
in
these
sediments
A
benzene-oxidizing
Fe
III
-reducing
enrichment
culture
was
established
from
benzene-degrading
sediments
and
contained
an
organism
closely
related
to
the
uncultivated
Geobacter
spp
This
genus
contains
the
only
known
organisms
that
can
oxidize
aromatic
compounds
with
the
reduction
of
Fe
III
Sequences
closely
related
to
the
Fe
III
reducer
Geothrix
fermentans
and
the
aerobe
Variovorax
paradoxus
were
also
amplified
from
the
benzene-degrading
enrichment
and
were
present
in
the
benzene-degrading
sediments
However
neither
G.
fermentans
nor
V.
paradoxus
is
known
to
oxidize
aromatic
compounds
with
the
reduction
of
Fe
III
and
there
was
no
apparent
enrichment
of
these
organisms
in
the
benzene-degrading
sediments
These
results
suggest
that
Geobacter
spp
play
an
important
role
in
the
anaerobic
oxidation
of
benzene
in
the
Bemidji
aquifer
and
that
molecular
community
analysis
may
be
a
powerful
tool
for
predicting
a
site
’
s
capacity
for
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
49
At
the
onset
of
anaerobic
conditions
Fe
III
is
generally
the
most
abundant
terminal
electron
acceptor
in
aquifer
sediments
23
Therefore
biodegradation
of
BTEX
compounds
under
Fe
III
-reducing

process
25
However
anaerobic
biodegradation
of
some
BTEX
compounds
particularly
benzene
remains
poorly
understood
To
date
no
organism
capable
of
anaerobic
benzene
oxidation
has
been
isolated
and
investigations
of
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
under
various
geochemical
conditions
often
report
conflicting
results
24
Recent
studies
in
a
petroleum-contaminated
aquifer
in
Bemidji
Minn.
provided
evidence
for
benzene
mineralization
under
in
situ
Fe
III
-reducing
conditions
4
However
the
capacity
for
benzene
oxidation
coupled
to
Fe
III
reduction
was
not
detected
at
the
other
petroleum-contaminated
aquifers
that
were
evaluated
Furthermore
at
the
Bemidji
aquifer
anaerobic
benzene
oxidation
under
in
situ
conditions
was
only
found
within
a
portion
of
the
Fe
III
-reducing
zone
4
Although
there
were
no
apparent
correlations
between
benzene
oxidation
and
geochemical
parameters
5
there
was
a
strong
correlation
between
anaerobic
benzene
oxidation
and
the
abundance
of
members
of
the
family
Geobacteraceae
4
This
family
includes
the
only
organisms
known
to
couple
the
oxidation
of
several
monoaromatics
including
toluene
with
Fe
III
reduction

The
results
suggested
that
the
microbial
community
composition
in
the
Bemidji
aquifer
may
have
played
a
key
role
in
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
and
that
Geobacteraceae
in
particular
were
associated
with
benzenedegrading
activity
4
However
past
studies
have
not
evaluated
the
diversity
of
other
microbial
groups
with
molecular
methods
nor
did
they
evaluate
which
microorganisms
within
In
recent
years
the
potential
for
anaerobic
in
situ
biodegradation
of
monoaromatic
hydrocarbons
has
received
increasing
attention
e.g.
references

and

Petroleum
contamination
of
aquifers
is
common
in
the
United
States
and
other
industrialized
countries
with
sources
of
contamination
including
leaking
underground
fuel
storage
tanks
leachate
from
landfills
and
surface
spills
of
petroleum
products
42
47
Although
petroleum
is
comprised
of
a
complex
mixture
of
hydrocarbons
monoaromatic
hydrocarbons
benzene
toluene
ethylbenzene
and
xylenes
collectively
known
as
BTEX
are
of
particular
concern
BTEX
compounds
are
the
most
watersoluble
constituents
of
petroleum
and
have
a
relatively
low
sediment-water
coefficient
11
51
As
a
result
they
are
highly
mobile
in
aquifers
and
are
the
most
prevalent
petroleum
constituents
in
contaminated
groundwater
Among
BTEX
compounds
benzene
is
of
the
most
concern
because
it
is
highly
toxic
and
is
a
known
carcinogen
and
therefore
it
is
a
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency
“
priority
pollutant.
”
Although
BTEX
compounds
are
rapidly
degraded
under
aerobic
conditions
40
49
aerobic
biodegradation
is
selflimiting
due
to
the
low
aqueous
solubility
of
oxygen
and
the
rapid
depletion
of
oxygen
that
occurs
in
reduced
environments

is
located
in
a

area
and
was
contaminated
in
1979
when
a

is
composed
of
fairly

19
making
it

Anaerobic

Fig

indicated
that
microbial

at
the

site
was

from
that
at
sites
where
Fe

the

TEAP
PLFA

from
the
Fe

were
similar
and
exhibited
a
higher
diversity
of
PLFA
than
that
observed
at
the
uncontaminated

There
were
however
substantial
differences
between
the
PLFA
profiles
extracted
from
each
Fe

site
The
distribution
of
Geobacter
species
in
the
sediments
was
estimated
by
evaluating
the
five
PLFAs
that
are
most
abundant
in
known
Geobacter
species
37a
with
the
exclusion
of
the
ubiquitous
saturated
PLFAs
16:0
and
18:0
This
analysis
indicated
that
the
concentration
of
Geobacter
indicative
PLFAs
was
highest
at
site
IR-3
lower
at
sites
IR-2
and
IR-1
and
lowest
at
the
uncontaminated

However
these
results
must
be
viewed
with
caution
because
the
PLFAs
used
in
this
analysis
are
not
unique
to
Geobacter
spp
but
are
also
present
in
other
gram-negative

The

improved
the

However
especially
because

it

oxide
as
the

that
it
was
determined
to
be
within
the

to

Benzene-degrading

cultures
could
not
be
established
with

When
14C

was
added
to

culture
14
CO2
was
produced
over

the
14C
benzene
added
to
cultures
being
mineralized
to
14CO2
within
25
days
Thus
it
was
clearly
demonstrated
that
this

could
anaerobically
oxidize
benzene

DISCUSSION
The
results
from
molecular
phylogenetic
analysis
of
sediments
and
enrichment
cultures
as
well
as
the
PLFA
analysis
demonstrate
that
anaerobic
benzene
mineralization
under
Fe
III
-reducing
conditions
is
associated
with
increased
numbers
of
Geobacter
spp
This
finding
might
have
been
predicted
from
previous
pure-culture
studies
because
Geobacter
spp
are
the
only
organisms
available
in
culture
that
are
known
to
oxidize
aromatic
compounds
with
the
reduction
of
Fe
III
10
22
25
28
However
it
is
generally
considered
that
the
most
environmentally
significant
microorganisms
are
not
readily
recovered
in
laboratory
cultures
2
Furthermore
the
Geobacter
spp
currently
in
culture
are
not
known
to
metabolize
benzene
Therefore
it
was
not
necessarily
expected
that
organisms
closely
related
to
the
Geobacter
spp
that
are
available
in
pure
culture
would
predominate
in
the
zone
of
active
benzene
degradation
at
Bemidji
These
results
and
the
fact
that
a
Geobacter
species
was
a
dominant
organism
in
a
benzenedegrading
Fe
III
-reducing
enrichment
culture
that
was
estab-
lished
from
the
zone
of
benzene

the

more

The
PLFA
analysis
also
suggested
that
there
was
an
enrichment
of
Geobacteraceae
at
site
IR-3
However
the
PLFA
data
further
indicated
that
there
was
a
general
increase
in
the
microbial
population
at

IR-3
suggesting
that
in
addition
to
Geobacteraceae
other
microorganisms
were
also
enriched
at
this

Therefore
in
order
to
more
fully
explore
the
microbial
populations
that
might
be
involved
in
benzene
degradation
the
microbial
community
was
analyzed
in
more
detail
with
DGGE
Comparison

this
approach
was
clearly
effective
in
identifying
the
major
shifts
in
the
microbial
community
in
the
Bemidji
aquifer
In
an
attempt
to
avoid
biases
primers
that
targeted
bacteria
were
employed
under
low-stringency
conditions
at
annealing
temperatures
with
a
minimum
number
of
amplification
cycles
It
seems
likely
from
analysis
of
triplicate
sediment
DNA
extractions
that
any
PCR
biases
inherent
in
this
approach
were
consistent
between
samples
and
thus
differences
in
DGGE
profiles
between
sites
reflected
major
differences
in
the
composition
of
the
environmental
DNA
templates
The
fairly
simple
DGGE
patterns
obtained
with
domainlevel
primers
suggests
that
relatively
few
species
dominated
at
each
of
the
Bemidji
sites
especially
at
the
uncontaminated
site
This
conclusion
is
also
supported
by
community
PLFA
profiles
which
exhibited
relatively
low
diversity
compared
to
surficial
soils
The
apparent
simplicity
of
these
subsurface
microbial
communities
is
not
surprising
given
the
low
availability
of
organic
carbon
and
nutrients
generally
found
in
subsurface
sediments

Other
studies
of

in

have
also

low
levels
of

compared
to

The
DGGE
profiles
indicated
that
the
microbial
community
composition
differed
markedly
among
the
aerobic
Fe

reducing
and
methanogenic
zones
of
the
aquifer
In
addition
to
different
bands
predominating
in
samples
from
each
TEAP
zone
more
bands
were
recovered
from
all
of
the
contaminated
sediments
than
from
the
uncontaminated
sediments
These
results
suggest
that
different
microorganisms
have
a
selective
advantage
in
different
TEAP
zones
and
that
the
BTEX
contaminants
stimulated
the
growth
of
microorganisms
that
were
not
dominant
members
of
the
microbial
community
in
the
uncontaminated
sediments
It
is
likely
that
dominant
microorganisms
that
grew
in
response
to
the
BTEX
input
were
involved
in
BTEX
degradation
However
organic
matter
produced
by
the
BTEX
degraders
could
provide
substrates
for
the
growth
of
lesser
quantities
of
other
organisms
Enrichment
of
Geobacter

in
the
zone
of
benzene
degradation
In
accord
with
the
MPN-PCR
results
with
Geobacteraceae
primers
the
DGGE
analysis
of
the
sediments
with
bacterial
PCR
primers
suggested
that
the
IR-3
sediments
in
which
benzene
was
actively
degraded
were
enriched
with
Geobacteraceae
Several
Geobacteraceae
bands
such
as
Geo-83
and
Geo125
which
was
almost
identical
to
Geo-83
had
much
higher
intensity
at
site
IR-3
than
at
site
IR-1
or
IR-2
and
these
bands
were
not
detected
in
sediments
from
the
uncontaminated
or
methanogenic
sites
Geo-83
and
the
closely
related
sequences
represent
a
distinct
group
in
the
Geobacter
cluster
within
the

closely

is
involved
in

not

Similarly
it
is
possible
that
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
is
carried
out
by
a
microbial
consortium
that
includes
Geobacter

of

were

In
summary
although
comparative
analysis
of
16S
rDNA
sequences
does
not
allow
definitive
determination
of
which
microorganisms
are
responsible
for
a
specific
metabolism
in
the
environment
the
results
suggest
that
specific
Geobacter
spp
are
associated
with
the
capacity
for
benzene
degradation
in
this
petroleum-contaminated
aquifer
Evidence
supporting
this
conclusion
includes
i
the
significant
increase
in
Geobacteraceae
within
the
zone
of
benzene
degradation
ii
specific
enrichment
of
a
tight
phylogenetic
cluster
of
Geobacter
spp
in
the
zone
of
benzene
degradation
that
is
not
found
in
the
uncontaminated
sediments
iii
the
fact
that
the
genus
Geobacter
contains
organisms
known
to
be
able
to
oxidize
aromatic
compounds
with
the
reduction
of
Fe

and
iv

finding
that
Geobacter

-reducing
enrichment
culture
established
with
benzene-degrading
sediments
from

This
is
an
important
finding
because
to
date
the
specific
enrichment
of
Geobacter
spp
is
the
only
variable
which
has
been
found
to
be
associated
with
the
capacity
for
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
at
this

A

Thus
these

yield

’
s
capacity
for
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
In
recent
years
the
potential
for
anaerobic
in
situ
biodegradation
of
monoaromatic
hydrocarbons
has
received
increasing
attention
e.g.
references
4
14,24
and
37
Petroleum
contamination
of
aquifers
is
common
in
the
United
States
and
other
industrialized
countries
with
sources
of
contamination
including
leaking
underground
fuel
storage
tanks
leachate
from
landfills
and
surface
spills
of
petroleum
products
42
47
Although
petroleum
is
comprised
of
a
complex
mixture
of
hydrocarbons
monoaromatic
hydrocarbons
benzene
toluene
ethylbenzene
and
xylenes
collectively
known
as
BTEX
are
of
particular
concern
BTEX
compounds
are
the
most
water-soluble
constituents
of
petroleum
and
have
a
relatively
low
sediment-water
coefficient
11
51
As
a
result
they
are
highly
mobile
in
aquifers
and
are
the
most
prevalent
petroleum
constituents
in
contaminated
groundwater
Among
BTEX
compounds
benzene
is
of
the
most
concern
because
it
is
highly
toxic
and
is
a
known
carcinogen
and
therefore
it
is
a
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency
“
priority
pollutant
Although
BTEX
compounds
are
rapidly
degraded
under
aerobic
conditions
40
49
aerobic
biodegradation
is
self-limiting
due
to
the
low
aqueous
solubility
of
oxygen
and
the
rapid
depletion
of
oxygen
that
occurs
in
reduced
environments
49
At
the
onset
of
anaerobic
conditions
Fe
III
is
generally
the
most
abundant
terminal
electron
acceptor
in
aquifer
sediments
23
Therefore
biodegradation
of
BTEX
compounds
under
Fe
III
-reducing
conditions
has
the
potential
to
be
an
effective
natural
attenuation
process
25
However
anaerobic
biodegradation
of
some
BTEX
compounds
particularly
benzene
remains
poorly
understood
To
date
no
organism
capable
of
anaerobic

has
been
isolated
and

conflicting
results

Geobacteraceae

This
family
includes
the
only
organisms
known
to
couple
the
oxidation
of
several
monoaromatics
including
toluene
with
Fe

The
results
suggested
that
the
microbial
community
composition
in
the
Bemidji
aquifer
may
have
played
a
key
role
in
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
and
that
Geobacteraceae
in
particular
were
associated
with
benzene-degrading
activity

However
past
studies
have
not
evaluated
the
diversity
of
other
microbial
groups
with
molecular
methods
nor
did
they
evaluate
which
microorganisms
within
the
family
Geobacteraceae
are
associated
with
the
capacity
for
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
Therefore
no
conclusions
have
been
drawn
regarding
which
species
of
Geobacteraceae
are
associated
with
benzene-oxidizing
activity
and
whether
other
unrelated
phylogenetic
groups
can
also
play
a
role
in
benzene
degradation
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
use
a
multifaceted
approach
including
biodegradation
studies
molecular
phylogenetic
approaches
lipid
analysis
and
culturing
studies
to
analyze
the
microbial
community
associated
with
benzene
oxidation
at
the
Bemidji
aquifer
The
results
suggest
that
a
narrow
phylogenetic
group
of
organisms
within
theGeobacter
cluster
22
play
an
important
role
in
the

This
site
is
located
in
a
remote

area
and
was
contaminated
in
1979
when
a

is
composed
of
fairly
homogeneous

The

from

analysis
of

and

cultures
as
well
as
the

demonstrate
that

benzene
mineralization
under
Fe

conditions
is
associated
with
increased
numbers
of
Geobacter

This
finding
might
have
been
predicted
from
previous
pure-culture
studies
because
Geobacter
spp
are
the
only
organisms
available

that
are

to
oxidize

However
it
is
generally
considered
that
the
most
environmentally
significant
microorganisms
are
not
readily
recovered
in
laboratory
cultures

Furthermore
the
Geobacter
spp
currently
in
culture
are
not
known
to
metabolize
benzene
Therefore
it
was
not
necessarily
expected
that
organisms
closely
related
to
the
Geobacter
spp
that
are
available
in

would
predominate
in

Other
aromatic
hydrocarbons
including

and
naphthalene
are
also
degraded
under
Fe

conditions
at
the
Bemidji
site

However
the
degradation
of
these
hydrocarbons
is
not
localized
at
only
one
site
as
is
benzene
degradation
Since
attempts
to
obtain
pure
cultures
of
benzene-degrading
Fe
III
reducers
have
as
yet
been
unsuccessful
it
was
considered
that
comparative
studies
between
sites
that
were
geochemically
similar
but
differed
in
the
capacity
to
degrade
benzene
might
reveal
microorganisms
specifically
associated
with
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
Results
of
MPN-PCR
studies
with
PCR
primers
specific
for
microorganisms
in
the
family
Geobacteraceae
reported
here
and
previously

indicated
that
the
benzene-degrading
sediments
from
site
IR-3
had
significantly
more
Geobacteraceae
than
did
the
other
sediments
The
PLFA
analysis
also
suggested
that
there
was
an
enrichment
of
Geobacteraceae
at
site
IR-3
However
the
PLFA
data
further
indicated
that
there
was
a
general
increase
in
the
microbial
population
at
site
IR-3
suggesting
that
in
addition
toGeobacteraceae
other
microorganisms
were
also
enriched
at
this
site
Therefore
in
order
to
more
fully
explore
the
microbial
populations
that
might
be
involved
in
benzene
degradation
the
microbial
community
was
analyzed
in
more
detail
with
DGGE

this
approach
was
clearly
effective
in
identifying
the
major
shifts
in
the
microbial
community
in
the
Bemidji
aquifer
In
an
attempt
to
avoid
biases
primers
that
targeted
bacteria
were
employed
under
low-stringency
conditions
at
annealing
temperatures
with
a
minimum
number
of
amplification
cycles
It
seems
likely
from
analysis
of
triplicate
sediment
DNA
extractions
that
any
PCR
biases
inherent
in
this
approach
were
consistent
between
samples
and
thus
differences
in
DGGE
profiles
between
sites
reflected
major
differences
in
the
composition
of
the
environmental
DNA
templates
The
fairly
simple
DGGE
patterns
obtained
with
domain-level
primers
suggests
that
relatively
few
species
dominated
at
each
of
the
Bemidji
sites
especially
at
the
uncontaminated
site
This
conclusion
is
also
supported
by
community
PLFA
profiles
which
exhibited
relatively
low
diversity
compared
to
surficial
soils
The
apparent
simplicity
of
these
subsurface
microbial
communities
is
not
surprising
given
the
low
availability
of
organic
carbon
and
nutrients
generally
found
in
subsurface
sediments
3

16
Other
studies
of
phylogenetic
diversity
in
subsurface
microbial
communities
have
also
indicated
relatively
low
levels
of
diversity
8
36
compared
to
surficial
soil
communities
9
15
41
The
DGGE
profiles
indicated
that
the
microbial
community
composition
differed
markedly
among
the
aerobic
Fe
III
-reducing
and
methanogenic
zones
of
the
aquifer
In
addition
to
different
bands
predominating
in
samples
from
each
TEAP
zone
more
bands
were
recovered
from
all
of
the
contaminated
sediments
than
from
the
uncontaminated
sediments
These
results
suggest
that
different
microorganisms
have
a
selective
advantage
in
different
TEAP
zones
and
that
the
BTEX
contaminants
stimulated
the
growth
of
microorganisms
that
were
not
dominant
members
of
the
microbial
community
in
the
uncontaminated
sediments
It
is
likely
that
dominant
microorganisms
that
grew
in
response
to
the
BTEX
input
were
involved
in
BTEX
degradation
However
organic
matter
produced
by
the
BTEX
degraders
could
provide
substrates
for
the
growth
of
lesser
quantities
of
other
organisms
Enrichment

spp
in

zone
of

accord
with
the
MPN-PCR
results
withGeobacteraceae
primers
the
DGGE
analysis
of
the
sediments
with
bacterial
PCR
primers
suggested
that
the
IR-3
sediments
in
which
benzene
was
actively
degraded
were
enriched
withGeobacteraceae
Several
Geobacteraceae
bands
such
as
Geo-83
and
Geo-125
which
was
almost
identical
to
Geo-83
had
much
higher
intensity
at
site
IR-3
than
at
site
IR-1
or
IR-2
and
these
bands
were
not
detected
in
sediments
from
the
uncontaminated
or
methanogenic
sites
Geo-83
and
the
closely
related
sequences
represent
a
distinct
group
in
the
Geobacter
cluster
within
the
familyGeobacteraceae

A
more
detailed
evaluation
of
the
diversity
of
Geobacteraceae
with
primers
specific
for
this
family
further
demonstrated
the
enrichment
of
the
Geobactercluster
at
site
IR-3
and
suggested
that
these
organisms
were
not
present
in
the

sediments
The
only
sequences
that
were
recovered
from
the
uncontaminated
sediments
withGeobacteraceae-targeted
primers
were
not
closely
related
to
known
Geobacteraceae
spp
The
finding
that
there
is
a
specific
enrichment
of
Geobacterspp
in
the
zone
of
benzene
degradation
is
of
interest
becauseGeobacter
spp
are
the
only
organisms
in
pure
culture
that
have
been
reported
to
oxidize
aromatic
compounds
to
carbon
dioxide
28
Although
no
pure
cultures
have
been
found
to
degrade
benzene
as
reported
here
a
Geobacter
sp
closely
related
to
the
sequences
that
predominated
in
the
benzene
degradation
zone
was
a
dominant
organism
in
the
benzene-oxidizing
Fe

culture
Benz-76
A
benzene-degrading
enrichment
culture
could
only
be
established
with
sediments
from
the
zone
of
benzene
degradation
and
not
from
the
uncontaminated
sediments
which
lack
theGeobacter
spp
that
predominate
in
the
zone
of
benzene
degradation
Interestingly
a
Geobacter
cluster
organism
FeR
was
also
the
dominant
member
of
toluene-degrading
enrichment
cultures
established
with
sediments
from
the
Bemidji
site
4
Comparison
of
FeR
to
the
Geobacteraceaesequences
described
here
suggested
that
FeR
was
closely
related
to
but
distinct
from
Benz-76
sharing
94
of
102
base

Another
sequence
that
was
consistently
recovered
from
the
benzene-degrading
sediments
but
not
the
uncontaminated
sediments
was
Gthrx-84
which
is
most
closely
related
to
G.
fermentans.G
fermentans
is
capable
of
completely
oxidizing
acetate
to
carbon
dioxide
with
Fe
III
serving
as
the
sole
electron
acceptor
but
in
contrast
to
several
Geobacter
species
it
does
not
use
aromatic
compounds
28
A
sequence
closely
related
toG
fermentans
was
recovered
from
the
benzene-oxidizing
Fe
III
-reducing
enrichment
culture
but
the
DGGE
band
for
this
sequence
was
not
as
intense
as
the
Geobacter
band
Thus
it
is
not
known
if
this
organism
was
involved
in
the
benzene
degradation
or
survived
on
the
products
of
the
Geobacter
sp
in
the
enrichment
that
is
hypothesized
to
have
been
the
benzene
degrader
Previous
studies
employing
a
dilution-to-extinction
culturing
method
demonstrated
that
G.
fermentans
was
a
numerically
dominant
acetate-oxidizing
Fe
III
reducer
in
uncontaminated
sediments
from
Bemidji
as
well
as
in
sediments
from
the
benzene-degrading
Fe
III
reduction
zone
4
In
contrast
to
the
pervasiveness
ofGeothrix
spp.
Geobacter
spp
were
only
numerically
significant
in
the
zone
of
benzene
degradation
in
those
culturing
studies
While
Gthrx-84
was
not
detected
in
the
uncontaminated
sediments
this
sequence
was
found
at
comparable
band
intensities
in
all
of
the
sediments
in
which
Fe
III
reduction
was
the
TEAP
The
fact
that
the
Gthrx-84
sequence
was
not
uniquely
enriched
in
the
zone
of
benzene
degradation
suggests
that
it
is
not
specifically
involved
in
benzene
degradation
at
site
IR-3
In
a
similar
manner
although
the
sequence
Beta-169
was
recovered
from
site
IR-3
but
not
from
the
uncontaminated
site
the
intensities
of
the
Beta-169
band
were
similar
in
all
three
Fe
III
-reducing
sites
suggesting
that
it
was
not
uniquely
associated
with
benzene
degradation
The
sequence
Beta-142
that
was
also
found
at
site
IR-3
but
not
at
the
uncontaminated
site
is
most
closely
related
to
V.
parodoxusHW1
20
and
an
unidentified
toluene
degrader
strain
D8
33
V.
parodoxus
is
an
obligate
aerobe
46
and
although
they
have
not
been
characterized
strains
HW1
and
D8
were
also
grown
under
aerobic
conditions
20,33
Therefore
it
seems
unlikely
that
these
organisms
are
capable
of
aromatic
degradation
under
anaerobic
Fe
III
-reducing
conditions
In
addition
Beta-142
was
detected
at
other
Fe
III
-reducing
sites
albeit
with
lower
band
intensities
Fig
3
indicating
that
its
presence
is
not
unique
to
the
benzene-oxidizing
site
IR-3
However
a
sequence
closely
related
to
V.
parodoxus
was
recovered
from
the
benzene-oxidizing
Fe
III
-reducing
enrichment
culture
along
with
a
Geobactersequence
and
a
Geothrix
sequence
Thus
the
possibility
that
an
organism
s
closely
related
to
V.
parodoxus
is
involved
in
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
can
not
be
eliminated
Similarly
it
is
possible
that
anaerobic
benzene
degradation
is
carried
out
by
a
microbial
consortium
that
includes
Geobacter
sp.
Geothrix
sp.
and
a
relative
of
V.
parodoxus
all
of
which
were
detected
in
both
the
benzene-oxidizing
sediments
and
the
enrichment
In
summary
although
comparative
analysis
of
16S
rDNA
sequences
does
not
allow
definitive
determination
of
which
microorganisms
are
responsible
for
a
specific
metabolism
in
the
environment
the
results
suggest
that
specific
Geobacter
spp
are
associated
with
the
capacity
for
benzene
degradation
in
this
petroleum-contaminated
aquifer
Evidence
supporting
this
conclusion
includes
i
the
significant
increase
in
Geobacteraceae
within
the
zone
of
benzene
degradation
ii
specific
enrichment
of
a
tight
phylogenetic
cluster
of
Geobacter
spp
in
the
zone
of
benzene
degradation
that
is
not
found
in
the
uncontaminated
sediments
iii
the
fact
that
the
genus
Geobacter
contains
organisms
known
to
be
able
to
oxidize
aromatic
compounds
with
the
reduction
of
Fe
III
and
iv
the
finding
that
Geobacter
spp
were
dominant
organisms
in
a
benzene-oxidizing
Fe
III
-reducing
enrichment
culture
established
with
benzene-degrading
sediments
from
this
aquifer
This
is
an
important
finding
because
to
date
the
specific
enrichment
ofGeobacter
spp
is
the
only
variable
which
has
been
found
to
be
associated
with
the
capacity
for
anaerobic
benzene
degradation

The

a

plain
with
a
shallow
unconfined

with
groundwater

from
the
hills
to
the

To
test
the
role
that

the
rate
of
mineralisation
of

The
rate
of
toluene
mineralisation
was
minimal
in
non-amended
groundwater
but
was
enhanced
by
the
addition
of

further
enhanced
by
the

Although
the

greatly
stimulated

the

the

culture
of

It
is
thus
probable
that
Desulfosporosinus

plays
a
similar
role
in
this

to
the
role
methanogens
play
in
toluene-degrading
consortia

is
they
consume
the
hydrogen
and
organic
acids
produced
by
fermentative
organisms
from
the
toluene
thus
preventing
the
accumulation
of
fermentation
products
that
would
otherwise
make
the
further
degradation
of
toluene
thermodynamically
impossible

mineralisation
rates

The

sulfate-reducing
species
that
was
isolated
from
the

was
Desulfosporosinus
meridiei
which
would
have
evaded
detection
by
the
FISH
technique
used
in
the
initial
studies
and
which

not
contain

What
is

that

Benzene
can
be
degraded
under
sulfate-reducing
conditions
Lovley

but
this
does
not
occur
significantly
in
the
Swan
Coastal
Plain
aquifer
The
reason
for
this
is
unknown
However
benzene
is
rapidly
degraded
in
Swan
Coastal
Plain
aquifer
material
under
aerobic
or
nitrate-reducing
conditions
As
benzene
does
not
show
natural
attenuation
by
microbial
populations
in
the
Swan
Coastal

aquifer
high
concentrations
persist
in
groundwater

large
distances

have
serious
implications

the

as

It

for
the

FISH

Profiles
of
volatile
hydrocarbons
mostly

benzene
toluene

of
xylene

at

over

The
results
from
two
of
those

are
shown
in
Figure

The
profiles
changed
greatly
on
a
seasonal
basis
and
the
depth
penetration
of
oxygen
into
the
soil
was
highly
dependent
upon
the
water
content
in
the
soil
profile
Davis

The
Swan
Coastal
Plain
receives
little
rain
over
the
Australian
summer
162
mm
from
October
to
April
however
considerable
precipitation
occurs
during
the
Australian
winter
months
609
mm
from
May
to
September
The
increase
in
the
water
content
in
the
soil
reduces
the
air
filled
porosity
especially
in
a
moisture
retaining
layer
at
about
0.1
to
0.3
m
below
the
ground
surface
which
restricts
vapour
and
oxygen
transport
Thus
in
wet
periods
aromatic
hydrocarbons
penetrate
much
higher
in
the
soil
profile
and
oxygen
penetration
is
shallower

of

the

the

In

this

as

may
account
for

Davis

With
an

The
microbial

at

showed
a
slightly
less
propensity
for

At
the

the
microbial

was
not
exposed
to
measurable
concentrations
of
TPH
i.e.
1
mg

but
showed
considerable
propensity
to
mineralise
aromatic
hydrocarbons
In
fact
the
surface
microbial
population
mineralised
hydrocarbons
at
about
the
same
rate
as
measured
in

soils

Further
evidence
for
the
lack
of
hydrocarbon
exposure
to
the
microbial
population
in
the

was
the
relative

extracted
from

more

TPH
was
much
higher
in
the

Figure

This
occurred
because
greater

limited
the

Intrinsic

of

in

seems
to
generally
occur
provided
there
are

to
the

Moseley
and
Meyer
1992
showed
that
above
hydrocarbon-contaminated
groundwater
greater
accumulation
of
soil
gas
aromatic
hydrocarbons
occurred
under
paved
areas
and
building
structures
than
under
non-built-up
areas
This
resulted
in
substantial
leakage
of
benzene
into
the
building
structures
and
the
crawl
space
beneath
the
floors
For
intrinsic
remediation
of
hydrocarbon
vapours
in
the
soil
profile
above
contaminated
groundwater
natural
ventilation
of
the
soil
profile
must
not
be
impeded
since
this
will
slow
biodegradation
and
the
containment
of
vapours
within
the
vadose
zone
Except
for
the
transport
of
benzene
in
groundwater
intrinsic
remediation
by
microbial
populations
prevents
the
extensive
transport
of
aromatic
hydrocarbons
in
the
aquifer
or
the
vadose
zone
on
the
Swan
Coastal
Plain
This
is
consistent
with
the
findings
of
many
studies
conducted
in
many
different
aquifers
The
transport
of
benzene
in
the
groundwater
on
the
Swan
Coastal
Plain
is
of
concern
however
addition
of
oxygen
or
nitrate
in
the
benzene
plume
could
be
undertaken
as
a
final
remediation
measure
It
remains
unclear
why
benzene
mineralisation
can
occur
under
sulfate-reducing
conditions
in
some
aquifers
but
not
others
Although
the
fate
of
the
aromatic
hydrocarbons
and
the
microbial
processes
involved
in
their
mineralisation
can
be
inferred
through
geochemical
analysis
and
transport
modeling
measurement
of
microbial
activities
using
radio-labeled
compounds
increased
our
understanding
of
the
processes
and

rates
of
mineralisation
of
the
pollutants
The
analysis
of
microbial
populations
through
phospholipid-derived
signatures
and

estimates
provided
insight
into
the
microbial
populations
in
the
soil
profile
above
hydrocarbon-contaminated
groundwater
Table

however
signature

the

plume
provided
little
useful
information

greatly
superior

however
the
successful
use

has
not
been

A
diesel-degrading
bacterium
strain
IU5
isolated
from
oil-contaminated
soil
was
characterized
in
this
study
Fatty
acid
and

rDNA
sequence
analysis
identified
IU5
as
a
strain
of
Pseudomonas

and

identified
the
bacterium
’
s

as

and
P.

IU5
degraded
up
to
60
of
applied
diesel
8500
mg/kg
over
13
days
in
a
soil-slurry
phase
In
addition
this
strain
was
able
to
grow
on
many
other
petroleum
hydrocarbons
as
sole
carbon
sources
including
crude
oil
gasoline
benzene
toluene
xylene
and
even
PAHs
such
as
naphthalene
phenanthrene
and
pyrene
Therefore
P.

IU5
may
be
useful
for
bioremediation
of
soils
and
groundwater
contaminated
with
a
variety
of
hydrocarbons
Diesel
contains
many
highly
concentrated
toxic
materials
Dillard
et
al
1997
Gold-Bouchot
et
al
1997
and
diesel
contamination
can
negatively
influence
soil
microbes
and
plants
as
well
as
contaminate
groundwater
which
may
be
used
for
drinking
or
agriculture
Because
of
this
a
variety
of
methods
have
been
developed
to
treat
diesel
contamination
While
many
of
the
established
physical
and
chemical
methods
are
efficient
they
are
also
expensive
and
can
cause
recontamination
by
secondary
contaminants
Bioremediation
is
the
microbial
degradation
of
organic
pollutants
such
as
petroleum
in
soil
and
groundwater
This
technique
has
the
benefits
of
high
treatment
efficiency
low
cost
relatively
quick
action
in
site
and
ex
site
application
and
compatibility
with
other
techniques
Nevertheless
the
application
of
hydrocarbon-degrading
bacteria
in
oil-contaminated
sites
does
not
guarantee
to
remove
all
components
of
crude
oil
because
some
components
still
remain
difficult
to
degrade
such
as
alkanes
of
shorter
and
longer
chains
C10
and
C20–C40
and
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
PAHs
Yuste
et
al
2000
So
it
is
meaningful
to
find
a
new
bacterial
strain
that
can
metabolize
a
broad
range
of
the
hydrocarbons
contained
in
crude
oil
especially
the
highly
persistent
components
Thus
since
the
discovery
of
new
strain
s
and
the
finding
of
optimum
conditions
of
diesel-degrading
bacteria
for
the
enhancement
of
microbial
activity
are
vital
to
economically
and
effectively
amelionating
contaminated
soils
and
groundwater
here
we
sought
to
isolate
a
diesel-degrading
bacterium
and
examine
its
characteristics
and
abilities
to
degrade
diesel
and
other
petroleum
hydrocarbons

Of

was
best
able
to
degrade

This
strain
was
classified
as

Also
five
other
isolated
strains
IU1
IU2
IU4
IU6
and
U2
were
identified
as
Pseudomonas
aeruginosa
based
on
MIDI
results
Our
finding
was
consistent
with
a
previous
report
which
found
that
Pseudomonas
sp
was
the
most
degradative
bacterium
in
a
mixed
bacterial
consortium
isolated
from
oil-contaminated
soil
samples
Rahman
et
al
2002
We
next
examined
the
growth
properties
of
this
isolate
on
various
petroleum
hydrocarbons
other
than
diesel
data
not
shown
We
found
that
strain
IU5
grew
on
crude
oil
equally
as
well
as
it
grew
on
diesel
while
it
showed
a
slightly
lower
affinity
for
gasoline
In
addition
this
strain
seemed
to
degrade
many
other
hydrocarbons
such
as
benzene
toluene
xylene
naphthalene
phenanthrene
and
pyrene
but
not
ethylbenzene
This
result
implied
that
a
mixture
of
hydrocarbons
stimulated
the
growth
more
than
a
single
kind
of
hydrocarbon
due
to
the
presence
of
more
carbon
sources
Especially
in
this
study
we
found
a
strain
of
P.
aeruginosa
capable
of
using
pyrene
which
has
the
most
complex
ring
structure
among
the
PAHs
of
crude
oil
as
a
unique
carbon
source
in
pure
culture
Diesel-degrading
bacterium
IU5
383
Although
a
previous
report
mentioned
that
P.
aeruginosa
can
use
a
large
variety
of
carbon
sources
Holloway
1996
not
all
strains
can
grow
on
such
a
broad
range
of
hydrocarbons
For
example
P.
aeruginosa
RR1
isolated
from
an
oil-contaminated
site
could
not
utilize
benzene
toluene
and
PAHs
naphthalene
phenanthrene
and
pyrene
as
a
sole
carbon
source
Yuste
et
al
2000
and
P.
aeruginosa
CM323
obtained
from
a
hydrocarbonpolluted
subsoil
could
not
grow
on
benzene
and
xylene
but
on
toluene
and
ethylbenzene
not
tested
with
PAHs
Cavalca
et
al
2000
Thus
the
ability
to
use
a
broad
range
of
hydrocarbons
would
differentiate
this
strain
as
specific
even
within
the
same
species
Because
microbial
activity
is
of
paramount
importance
to
effective
bioremediation
we
examined
the
relative
activities
of
IU5
under
different
temperature
and
pH
conditions
data
not
shown
We
found
that
the
optimum
condition
for
IU5
diesel-degradation
was
30
C
and
pH
7
which
is
similar
to
the
optimum
conditions
of
a
previously
reported
crude
oil-degrading
consortium
30
C
and
pH
7.5
Rahman
et

P.

IU5
showed
97
activity
at
20
C
and
74
activity
at
pH

suggesting
that
IU5
maintains
a
relatively
high
activity
even
under
acidic
conditions
and
different
temperatures
Otherwise
this
strain
was
restrained
with
10
activity
at
10
C
and
with
19
activity
at

The
IU5-based
degradation
of
diesel
in
diesel-contaminated
soil
was
examined
in
a
soil-slurry
system
for
13
days

During
this
time
period
IU5
could
degrade
a

Mycobacterium
goodii
X7B
which
had
been
primarily
isolated
as
a
bacterial
strain
capable
of
desulfurizing
dibenzothiophene
to
produce
2-hydroxybiphenyl
via
the
4S
pathway
was
also
found
to
desulfurize
benzothiophene
The
desulfurization
product
was
identified
as
o-hydroxystyrene
by
gas

This
strain
appeared
to
have
the
ability
to
remove
organic
sulfur
from
a
broad
range
of
sulfur
species
in
gasoline
When
Dushanzi
straight-run
gasoline
DSRG227
containing
various
organic
sulfur
compounds
was
treated
with
immobilized
cells
of
strain
X7B
for
24
h
the
total
sulfur
content
significantly
decreased
from
227
to
71
ppm
at
40°C
GC

were

to

evaluate
the
effects
of

X7B
treatment
on
the
contents
of
gasoline
In
addition
when
immobilized
cells
were
incubated
at
40°C
with
DSRG275
the
sulfur
content
decreased
from
275
to
54
ppm
in
two
consecutive
reactions
With
this
excellent
efficiency
strain
X7B
is
considered
a
good
potential
candidate
for
industrial
applications
for
the
biodesulfurization
of
gasoline

With
the
increasing
demands
for
energy
and
more
stringent
environmental
policies
deep
desulfurization
of
petroleum
is
becoming
more
and
more
desired
In
terms
of
available
technologies
the
sulfur
content
in
gasoline
can
be
reduced
to
30
ppm
by
current
hydrotreatment
processes
The
major
problem
with
deep
desulfurization
of
gasoline
is
that
conventional
hydrodesulfurization
HDS
technology
results
in
a
significant
reduction
in
the
octane
number
due
to
the
saturation
of
olefins
in
naphtha
from
fluid
catalytic
cracking
which
also
causes
more
hydrogen
consumption
21
However
thiophenic
compounds
such
as
benzothiophene
BTH
and
thiophene
T
and
their
derivates
as
well
as
thiol
are
major
sulfur
compounds
in
gasoline
23
If
biodesulfurization
BDS
can
be
applied
effectively
to
gasoline
the
refiner
will
be
offered
a
less
expensive
alternative
to
HDS
that
also
avoids
the
drawback
of
octane
degradation

On
the
other
hand
since
distillate
fractions
are
often
treated
at
high
temperatures
there
may
be
some
cost
savings
through
the
use
of
moderate
thermophiles
if
BDS
is
integrated
with
HDS
during
refinery
without
cooling
the
stock
to
30°C
15
Moreover
the
desulfurization
activity
will
also
be
enhanced
due
to
the
higher
mass
transfer
rate
at
high
temperatures

BDS
it
is

It
was
interesting
that
the
three
BTH-
and
DBT-desulfurizing
strains
had
the
same
BTH
degradation
steps
Fig
4
This
clearly
indicates
that
there
are
some
common
characteristics
among
them
However
it
has
been
reported
that
IGTS8
can
not
utilize
BTH
as
a
sole
sulfur
source
10
suggesting
that
X7B
may
carry
a
novel
system
for
the
desulfurization
of
heterocyclic
sulfur-containing
xenobiotics
More
detailed
analyses
of
the
purified
enzymes
and
genes
involved
in
BTH
degradation
by
strain
X7B
would
provide
a
further
corroborative
explanation
for
the
biodesulfurization
of
both
BTH
and
DBT
by
a
single
bacterial
strain
Most
of
the
sulfur
species
in
gasoline
are
a
result
of
fluid
catalytic
cracking
of
gas
oils
or
residuum
materials
that
are
relatively
rich
in
sulfur
There
are
three
main
classes
of
organic
molecules
namely
thiophenes
BTHs
and
mercaptans
Therefore
refineries
using
fluid
catalytic
cracking
to
produce
gasoline
components
are
concerned
with
sulfur
reduction
in
gasoline
28
We
found
that
the
range
of
substrates
utilized
as
sulfur
sources
by
M.
goodii
X7B
is
quite
broad
Besides
BTH
and
DBT
strain
X7B
could
also
grow
by
using
alkylated
BTHs
alkylated
DBTs
thiophene
carboxylic
acid
thiophene
acetic
acid
3,3′-thiodipropionic
acid
and
propylmercaptan
as
sole
sulfur
sources

The
major
problem
with
the
deep
desulfurization
of
gasoline
is
that
conventional
hydrodesulfurization
technology
results
in
a
significant
reduction
in
the
octane
number
due
to
the
saturation
of
olefins
in
naphtha
from
fluid
catalytic
cracking
21
28
Also
thiophenic
compounds
such
as
BTH
thiophene
and
their
derivates
as
well
as
thiol
are
major
sulfur
compounds
in
gasoline
23
If
BDS
can
be
applied
effectively
to
gasoline
the
refiner
will
be
offered
a
less
expensive
alternative
to
HDS
that
also
avoids
the
drawback
of
octane
degradation
Furthermore
BDS
will
significantly
reduce
energy
requirements
and
consequently
the
environmental
impact
brought
about
by
gasoline
combustion
20
The
process
challenges
to
developing
gasoline
BDS
lie
primarily
in
reactor
design
especially
that
for
oil
separations
4
28
The
process
must
also
minimize
the
problems
associated
with
the
toxicity
of
gasoline
to
the
biocatalyst
Most
BDS
processes
are
triphasic
systems
containing
cells
water
and
oil

28
It
is
very
difficult
to
separate
oil
and
water
from
the
emulsified
oil
In
this
study
the
immobilized-cell
system
adopted
for
BDS
made
it
easier
to
separate
oil
from
the
reaction
system
and
greatly
minimized
the
toxicity
of
gasoline
to
the
biocatalyst

Encapsulation
provided
the
bacterial

with
a
protective
solid
barrier
which
may
have
somewhat
limited
the

according
to
our
knowledge
no
studies

have
ever

Environmental
contamination
by

is
a
serious
problem
worldwide
A
Considerable
amounts
of
hydrocarbons
have
been
released
into
water

soil
as
a
result
of
pipeline

ruptures
A
Apart
from
incidental
contamination
of
the
ecosystem
vast
amounts
of
oily
sludge
generated
in
water–oil
separation
systems
at
oilfields
and
accumulation
of
waste
oily
materials
in
crude-oil
storage
tanks
also
causes
problems
to
the
environment
Mrayyan

Many
components
of
oily
sludge
are
toxic
mutagenic
and
carcinogenic
A
They
are
therefore
classified
as
priority
environmental
pollutants
by

A
Improper
disposal
of

Physical

methods
include
incineration
chlorination
ozonation
and

Ting

Many
of
these
technologies
however
are
either
costly
or
do
not
completely
remove

A
On
the
other
hand
biological

bioremediation
appears
to
be
among
the
most
promising
methods
for
dealing
with
a
wide
range
of
organic
contaminants
particularly
petroleum
hydrocarbons
A
The
technology
is
also
environmentally
sound
since
it
simulates
natural
processes

can
result
in
the
complete
destruction
of
hazardous
compounds
into
innocuous

Luminescence
was
read
at
20°C
after
15
min
The
soil
was
black
in
color
before
bioremediation
due
to
heavy
oily
sludge
contamination
and
lack
of
vegetation
A
This
may
be
due
to
a
relatively
low
WHC
in
the
presence
of
a
large
amount
of
oil
inhibiting
seed
germination

However
after
bioremediation
thinly
scattered
wild

such
as
Eleusine
indica
L.
Gaertn
A
and
Echinochloa
crusgalli
L.
Beauv
etc.
were
observed
A
This
was
attributed
mainly
to
the
increase
in
the
WHC
resulting
from
the
substantial
reduction
of
oil
content
in
the
soil
due
to
microbial
biodegradation

the

In
fact
the
indigenous
bacteria
capable
of
degrading
hydrocarbons
are
ubiquitous
A
However
the
environmental
conditions
in
the
oily
sludge-contaminated
soil
negatively
affected
the
growth
of
those
bacteria
A
It
was
reported
that

may
promote

In
this
experiment
an
aliquot
5
of
manure
was
added
to
the
treated
plot
and
it
can
be
seen
that
the
populations
of
heterotrophic
bacteria
TPH
degraders
and
PAH
degraders
in

higher

in
the

after

the

were
also
significantly
higher

than
that
in
the
control
at
the
end
of
the
experiment
360

indicating
that
amendment
with

had
increased

So
the
possible
reason
was
that
manure
itself
contains
a
diverse
range
of
microorganisms
in
addition
to
being
a
nutrient
source
A
Wuensche
et

1995
demonstrated
that
substrate
utilization
patterns
as
recorded
with
the
BIOLOG
system
are
suitable
for
rapidly
assessing
the
dynamics
of
autochthonous
soil
communities
and
evaluating
their
biodegradative

A

were
analyzed
using

to

among

This
indicates
that
the
addition
of

has
an
important
influence
on
the

A
The
absorbance
of
each
well
in
the

was
used
to
calculate

of
the

community
in
the
oily

in
different
plots
A
The
values
of

and

are
shown
in
Table

A
Statistical
analyses
using

also
showed
that
there
were
significant
differences
between

P

for
microbial
community

indexes

A
The
Shannon
index
H′
provides
information
about
the
distribution
of
carbon
source
utilization
by
microbial
communities
Bronwyn
et
al
A
1997
While
richness
index
considers
only
the
number
of
carbon
sources
utilized
in
GN
plates
the
McIntosh
index
provides
information
on
species
richness
based
on
number
of
species
and
their
abundances
Norhayati
et
al
A
2002
Thus
it
can
be
concluded
that
not
only
did
TPH
markedly
decrease
but
also
microbial
activity
species
and
diversity
of
the
soil
microorganism
community
increased
after
the
experiment
in
the
treated
plots
A
It
must
be
emphasized
that
CLPP
is
not
a
culture-independent
method
but
rather
is
biased
towards
fast-growing
easily
cultivable
species
Smalla
et
al
A
1998
Thus
CLPP
should
not
be
seen
as
a
standalone
method
but
can
be
highly
complementary
to
other
approaches
e.g.
classical
and
molecular
in
the
polyphasic
analysis
of
microbial
communities
There
are
no
universal
TPH

for
soils
contaminated
with

Salanitro
et

A
1997
Some
guidelines
were
developed
mainly
for
oil
concentration
but
petroleum
contains
hundreds
of
individual

with
varying

A
Ecotoxicity

should
therefore
be
used
as
supplementary
tools
for
monitoring

Grazyna

The
toxicity
of
the
oily
sludge-contaminated
soil
is
mostly
caused
by
the
organic
compounds
in
it
A
It
is
known
that
these
materials
have
very
low
aqueous
solubility
A
Thus
the
solvent
DCM
can
extract
the
organic
compounds
even
those
strongly
adsorbed
for
toxicity
tests
A
However
DCM
itself
is
highly
toxic
to
the
bioindicator

A
DMSO
has
low
toxicity
to
the

but
the
solubility
of
hydrocarbons
in
DMSO
is
lower
than
in
DCM
A
A
solvent
exchange
procedure
therefore
had
to
be
performed
with
DCM/DMSO

In
this
experiment
the
toxicity
of
the
soil
was
measured
in
the
different

A
A
sharp
increase

Fig

the
EC50
of
the

was
the
highest
which
indicates
that
bioremediation
reduced
the
toxicity
of
the

in
the

An
understanding

An
alternative
approach
to

the

background
concentrations

The

for
degradation
of
these
compounds
are
commonly
present
at
elevated
concentrations
at
contaminated
sites
Some
of
the
criteria
for
selection
of
probes
are
a
knowledge
of
the
biochemistry
and
genetics
of
the
target
organisms
and
the
genes
should
be
conserved
throughout
evolution

The
biochemistry
of
the
degradation
of
naphthalene
and
toluene
has
been
well
documented
for
many
strains

and
catabolic
genes
sharing
high
similarities
have
been
found
among
many
strains
capable
of
degrading
naphthalene
21
26

and
toluene

Probes
generated
from
these
genes
would
have
a
high
probability
of
detecting
genotypes
12
25
and
would
therefore
be
useful
in
identifying
the
adaptation
of
a
community
to
fuel
oil
exposure
For
these
studies

of
selected
genes
including
several
involved
in
the
degradation
of
benzene
toluene

BTEX
and
naphthalene
were
measured
in
subsurface
soil
samples
collected
along
a
gradient
of
BTEX
concentrations
at
a
LUST
site
These
field
studies
were
compared
with
results
obtained
from
microcosms
that
were
exposed
to
a
range
of
gasoline
concentrations
The
selected
field
site
was
contaminated
by
petroleum
products
and
is
located
beneath
Bridge

the
site
for
more
than
50
years
and
in
recent

is
a

Results
were
similar
to
those
normalized

with
the
exception
of
the

probe
which
was
not
significantly
higher
in
the
contaminated
samples
at
the
P
0.05
level
The
standard
errors
in
the
nahA
measurements
were
higher
when
normalized
per
microgram
DNA
than
when
normalized
per
gram
soil
This
relatively
high
variability
probably
resulted
in
a
lack
of
significant
difference
at
the
P
0.05
level
It
should
be
noted
that
in
many
cases
the
standard
error
was
higher
when
the
data
were
normalized
per
microgram
DNA
than
when
normalized
per

This
may
be
due
to
variability
in
measurement
of

by
fluorometry

At
both

the

concentrations
were
lower
than
those
at
the

Fig

This
may
have
resulted
from
the
inhibition
of
organisms
containing
the
target
sequences
by
toxic
components
in
the

and
from
the

increased
with

the
0.5-

treatments
and
the
maximum

at

at
75-

the
125-mg/g

at
the
4-week

indicating
that
there
may
have
been
increasing
inhibition
at
the
higher

This
inhibition
may
have
been
alleviated
during
the

due
to
degradation
and
volatilization
as
indicated
by
the

at
the

We
used
a
battery
of
gene
probes
in
conjunction
with
direct
DNA
extraction
from
soil
to
monitor
changes
occurring
in
soil
microbial
communities
exposed
to
petroleum
contamination
in
field
and
microcosm
studies
Several
genes
were
selected
as
probes
on
the
basis
of
their
encoded
enzyme
activities
involved
in
catabolism
of
common
fuel
oil
components
such
as
BTEX
compounds
naphthalene
and
alkanes
One
gene
fragment
was
chosen
as
an
indicator
of
the
presence
of
rRNA
group
I
Pseudomonas
species
a
group
of
bacteria
frequently
associated
with
the
degradation
of
aromatic
compounds
The
field
site
chosen
for
these
studies
had
a
history
of
hydrocarbon
exposure
due
to
leaking
underground
storage
tanks
dating
back
to
the
turn
of
the
century
As
expected
samples
taken
from
soils
contaminated
with
fuel
oil
as
determined
by
analysis
of
toluene
xylenes
ethylbenzene
and
naphthalene
by
gas
chromatography
were
significantly
enriched
in
several
of
the
bacterial
genes
that
encode
enzymes
that
catabolize
these
compounds
DNA
from
the
contaminated
samples
was
significantly
enriched
in
most
of
these
genes
relative
to
DNA
from
the
noncontaminated
site
The
highest
level
of
significance
P
0.01
between
contaminated
and
noncontaminated
soils
was
observed
with
xylE
which
encodes
catechol-2,3-dioxygenase
from
the
TOL
plasmid
pWW0
The
pathway
encoded
by
pWW0
attacks
xylenes
which
were
a
major
component
of
the
gasoline
present
in
these
soils
The
absence
of
hybridization
of
any
samples
with
the
alkB
gene
was
somewhat
surprising
since
alkanes
make
up
a
significant
proportion
of
gasoline
hydrocarbons
but
it
is
not
unprecedented
Berthelet
and
Greer
4
studied
samples
taken
from
35
sites
contaminated
with
fuel
oil
and
found
that
approximately
33
of
these
sites
did
not
yield
amplification
products
with
PCR
primers
directed
toward
this
gene
The
observation
that
most
of
the
catabolic
genes
used
in
this
study
hybridized
to
DNA
from
noncontaminated
samples
was
expected
These
genes
are
likely
to
be
widely
distributed
in
soils
and
may
be
involved
in
the
utilization
of
similar
aromatic
compounds
released
from
soil
organic
matter
The
fact
that
they
are
enriched
in
the
contaminated
sites
is
reflective
of
the
higher
concentrations
of
the
primary
substrates
present
in
the
contaminated
sites
A
linear
relationship
was
not
observed
between
the
extent
of
hybridization
of
the
catabolic
genes
and
the
concentrations
of
the
measured
aromatic
hydrocarbons
detected
for
example
see
Fig
2
at
all
concentrations
in
the
field
studies
A
linear
increase
between
the
concentrations
of
the
measured
aromatics
and
hybridization
of
xylE
existed
up
to
approximately
100
µg/g
but
hybridization
rapidly
decreased
as
a
function
of
aromatic
compound
concentration
above
this
level
Short-chain
hydrocarbons
present
in
gasoline
are
toxic
to
microorganism
2
and
it
is
likely
that
this
toxicity
inhibited
the
hosts
of
these
genes
at
high
concentrations
Inhibition
was
also
observed
in
the
microcosm
studies
at
the
higher
concentrations
greater
than
75
mg
gasoline
added
per
gram
of
soil
In
our
study
75
mg
gasoline
used
in
the
microcosms
contained
197.7
µg
aromatic
hydrocarbons/g
gasoline
This
corresponds
to
14,827.5
µg
of
the
measured
aromatics
added
per
gram
of
soil
or
over
100
times
the
level
observed
for
inhibition
in
the
field
studies
A
number
of
factors
may
explain
this
difference
including
the
following
1
the
field
site
was
very
old
and
it
is
likely
that
simple
aromatics
had
been
degraded
to
a
greater
extent
than
the
more
toxic
short-chain
alkanes
over
the
long
period
of
contamination
2
the
composition
of
the
gasoline
applied
to
the
microcosms
was
probably
different
from
that
released
at
the
field
site
and
3
the
microcosms
were
an
open
system
and
therefore
subject
to
volatilization
We
did
not
monitor
loss
of
the
gasoline
throughout
the
course
of
the
experiment
and
it
is
likely
that
the
concentration
of
gasoline
components
decreased
soon
after
application
due
to
volatilization
A
range
of
concentrations
of
gasoline
were
applied
to
the
microcosms
in
hopes
of
determining
the
lowest
amount
of
gasoline
required
for
observation
of
a
significant
increase
in
the
hybridization
of
the
gene
probes
The
lowest
concentration
used
in
these
experiments
was
0.5
mg
gasoline/g
soil
and
a
measurable
increase
in
hybridization
to
all
catabolic
genes
except
alkB
which
was
not
included
in
the
microcosm
studies
was
observed
at
this
level
Hybridization
intensity
of
all
catabolic
genes
had
either
returned
to
background
levels
or
was
approaching
background
levels
following
16
weeks
’
incubation
of
the
0.5
5
and
35
mg
gasoline/g
treatments
No
toluene
xylenes
or
naphthalene
were
detected
in
any
treatment
at
the
16-week
sampling
It
is
likely
that
all
of
the
aromatic
compounds
utilized
as
nutrient
sources
for
these
organisms
had
either
been
degraded
or
volatilized
before
the
16-week
time
point
In
contrast
hybridization
in
the
75-
and
125-mg/g
treatments
were
at
their
highest
levels
at
the
16-week
timepoint
suggesting
that
the
growth
of
the
hosts
of
these
genes
was
probably
inhibited
at
the
higher
concentrations
until
the
toxins
were
either
degraded
or
volatilized
Then
these
organisms
would
have
responded
to
the
added
carbon
sources
Since
none
of
the
primary
substrates
of
these
genes
were
detected
at
the
16-
week
timepoint
in
these
studies
it
is
likely
that
the
levels
of
hybridization
in
these
treatments
would
approach
background
levels
if
the
experiment
had
been
extended
several
weeks
This
is
in
contrast
to
what
was
observed
at
the
field
site
where
no
significant
difference
was
observed
in
the
hybridization
of
this
probe
between
the
contaminated
and
the
noncontaminated
sites
The
reason
for
this
difference
is
unknown
at
this
time
The
trend
of
hybridization
to
the
group
I
Pseudomonas
probe
was
fundamentally
different
from
that
observed
with
the
catabolic
probes
in
the
microcosm
studies
No
apparent
inhibition
was
observed
in
the
higher
gasoline
concentrations
and
no
significant
enrichment
was
observed
for
the
0.5-mg/g
treatment
A
clear
dose-response
relationship
was
observed
by
the
8-week
sampling
hybridization
increased
with
increasing
gasoline
additions
This
trend
remained
through
the
16-week
timepoint
These
bacteria
were
of
interest
due
to
their
importance
in
the
degradation
of
aromatic
hydrocarbons
and
many
of
the
genes
used
in
this
study
were
originally
cloned
from
members
of
the
rRNA
group
I
Pseudomonas
sp
These
data
suggest
that
group
I
Pseudomonas
sp
that
harbor
genes
that
do
not
hybridize
with
the
catabolic
probes
used
in
this
study
are
present
in
this
soil
and
that
the
majority
of
these
strains
are
less
sensitive
to
high
concentrations
of
gasoline
than
are
the
hosts
of
the
probes
used
here
The
rapid
and
significant
increase
in
hybridization
with
these
probes
except
in
the
0.5-mg/g
treatment
suggests
that
these
strains
are
utilizing
gasoline
components
as
a
nutrient
source
and
that
the
genetic
systems
harbored
by
these
organisms
may
be
important
in
the
remediation
of
high
levels
of
gasoline
contamination
that
would
inhibit
the
hosts
of
the
probes
used
in
this
study
There
are
a
number
of
criteria
by
which
a
suitable
indicator
of
community
adaptation
to
a
contaminant
might
be
judged
including
1
the
sensitivity
of
the
indicator
to
small

are
sensitive
indicators
of

the

low

The
microcosm

were
in
agreement
with
the
field
studies
for
this
probe
and
indicated
that
levels
of
0.5
mg
gasoline/g
were
sufficient
to
enrich
soil
communities
in
these
sequences
This
enrichment
did
not
persist
in
the
microcosms
for
long
periods
of
time
following
the
disappearance
of
aromatic
hydrocarbons
indicating
that
these
sequences
return
to
background
levels
soon
after
the

has
been

Hybridization

The
xylE
probe
was
not
a
sensitive
indicator
of
high
levels
of
contamination
however
due
to
the
probable
inhibition
of
the
hosts
of
these
sequences
at
higher
concentrations
of
gasoline
The
group
I
Pseudomonas
probe
was
more
sensitive
at
the
higher
hydrocarbon
concentration
treatments
in
the
microcosm
studies
although
this
was
not
true
of
the
field
site
This
discrepancy
may
indicate
that
there
are
unknown
ecological
factors
not
related
to
gasoline
contamination
that
affect
the
concentrations
of
these
sequences
and
this
probe
is
less
likely
to
be
a
reliable
general
indicator
of
contamination
than
the
xylE
probe
Approximately

by
at

Toluene

1,2,4-trimethylbenzene
were
most
frequently
utilized
as
growth
substrates
whereas
cyclic

alkanes
were

Pseudomonas

was
partitioned
into
16
protein-banding
groups
i.e.
subspecies
whose
catabolic

largely
restricted
to
substituted
aromatics
Different
members
of
subspecies
groups

pattern
analysis
often
exhibited
different

The

are
consonant
with

Description
of
study
site
and
sampling
wells
The
study
site
consisted
of
a
shallow
coastal
aquifer
underlying
the
U.S
Naval
Weapons
Station
in
Seal
Beach
Calif
The
aquifer
was
composed
primarily
of
silty
and
sandy
alluvial
deposits
and
was
contaminated
with
20,000
to
40,000
liters
of
unleaded
gasoline
from
an

to
a
maximum

The
wells
were
placed
in
1984
and
1985
by
the
U.S.

the
nature

Therefore
gasoline-degrading
isolates
obtained
from
groundwater
samples
in
the
present

A
total
of

samples
as
described

As
noted
above
the
gasoline-degrading
isolates
were
regarded
as
well-derived
rather
than
native

drilling
practices
were
not
employed
when
observation
wells
were
placed
in
1984
and
1985
Eighteen
of
these
isolates
were
included

from
the

positioned
above
a
sterile

was
sheared

Collection
of
groundwater
samples
Groundwater
samples
were
obtained
from
observation
wells
by
use
of
a
manual
bellows
pump
The
pump
intake
was
connected
by
sterile
tubing
to
a
1.27-cm-diameter
polyvinylchloride
sampling
tube
permanently
installed
in
each
observation
well
to
prevent
cross-contamination
of
wells
A
minimum
of
five
residual
well
volumes
of
groundwater
30
to
40
liters
was
pumped
out
of
the
well
as
a
flush
prior
to
sample
collection
After
flushing
a
sterile
1-liter
vacuum
flask
was
placed
between
the
polyvinylchloride
sample
tube
and
pump
assembly
by
using
sterile
Tygon
tubing
and
interconnectors
A
1-liter
sample
of
groundwater
was
drawn
into
the
flask
and
this
was
dispensed
aseptically
into
sterile
plastic

the

was
unusual
since
its
members
failed
to
grow
on
any
of
the
15
test
hydrocarbons
suggesting
that
these
isolates
required
one
or
more
gasoline
hydrocarbons
other
than
the
15
evaluated
Each
of
the
15
test
hydrocarbons
was
biodegraded
by
at
least
one
of
the
297
isolates
suggesting
that
the
primary
hydrocarbon
categories
of
gasoline
could
be
aerobically
biodegraded
in

given
appropriate

Several
catabolic
groups
e.g.
groups
38
47
75
84
94
and
105
included
degradation
of
a
single
test
hydrocarbon
Such
groups
were
not
the
most
frequently
observed
as
might
be
suspected
because
of
their
simplicity
suggesting
that
maintenance
of
multiple
catabolic
abilities
might
provide
some
selective
advantage
Catabolic
groups
which
included
degradation
of
five
or
more
test
hydrocarbons
were
likewise
infrequently
observed
e.g.
groups
42
45
51
61
Inspection
of
these
data
indicates
that
most
isolates
were
able
to
grow
on
2
or
3
different
test
hydrocarbons
suggesting
that
retention
of
other
numbers
of
catabolic
activities
might
not
offer
selective
advantage
at
this
site
Growth
screening
also
permitted
determination
of
the
frequencies
at
which

Alkylated
aromatic
hydrocarbons
such
as
toluene
p-xylene
ethylbenzene
and
1,2,4-trimethylbenzene
were
most
frequently
utilized
Approximately
75
of
isolates
were
capable
of
growth
on
toluene
vapors
as
a
sole
carbon
and
energy
source
Benzene
and
naphthalene
were
less
frequently
degraded
than
most
substituted
aromatics
with
the
exception
of
o-xylene
which
was
degraded
less
frequently
than
either
compound
or
than
its
isomeric
counterpart
p-xylene
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
more
than
150
toluenedegrading
isolates
were
unable
to
utilize
toluene
present
as
a
contaminant
in

suggesting
that
the
concentrations
of

were

compounds
included
the
cyclic

Unsubstituted

The

dendrograms
not

were
performed
on

AMBIS
groups
to
ensure
that
members
of
each
were
correlated
above
the
0.90
level
Inspection
of
the
dendrogram
shown
in
Fig

indicates
that
the
Seal
Beach
isolates
were
organized
into
two
broad
clusters
which
were
discriminated
by
a
correlation
value
of
about
0.47
The
upper
cluster
consisted
of
the
first
13
AMBIS
groups
while
the
lower
cluster
comprised
the
remainder
of
the
51
groups
Each
cluster
was
composed
of
members
correlated
with
one
another
at
a
level
of
about
0.55
or
higher
The
largest

21

In

the

included

which
were

However
benzene

were

more
frequently
by
members
of
the

Because
members
of
single
AMBIS
groups
often
displayed
different
growth
responses
on
a
given
test
hydrocarbon
it
was
not
feasible
to
reliably
predict
catabolic
activity
from
protein-banding
information
A
total
of
244
isolates
including
the
220
analyzed
by

were
identified
by
conventional

to

Nearly

of
the

The
majority
of
P.

exhibited
similar

activities

A
few
P.

however
displayed
protein-banding
patterns
which
differed
significantly
from
the
main
body
of

groups
49
to
51
P.

isolates
composing
AMBIS
groups
12
and
49
exhibited
unusual
catabolic
activities
compared
with
other
P.
aeruginosa
groups
since
they
grew
on
selected
alkanes
including
hexane
octane
decane
cyclohexane
and
methylcyclopentane
in
addition
to
the
more
frequently
catabolized
aromatics
Inclusion
of
these
catabolically
anomalous
strains
in
P.
aeruginosa
is
therefore
suspect
P.
putida
P.
stutzeri
and
the
Micrococcus
spp
were
capable
of
catabolizing
most
alkanes
and
were
distributed
throughout
the
mid
to
lower
regions
of
the

The
principal
advantage
of
vapor-phase
growth
tests
such
as
those
employed
in
this
investigation
is
that
they
can
be
performed
much
more
rapidly
than
more
complex
chemical
analytical
methods
thereby
permitting
the
examination
of
large
numbers
of
isolates
with
multiple
hydrocarbon
substrates
in
a
reasonable
time
frame
Unlike
batch
culture
techniques
in
which
a
single
hydrocarbon
concentration
is
typically
employed
tests
using
hydrocarbon
vapors
offer
organisms
a
range
of
substrate
concentrations
if
vapors
are
introduced
gradually
as
was
done
in
this
study
Such
a
technique
increases
the
likelihood
of
a
positive
growth
response
within
some
favorable
concentration
range
of
hydrocarbon
Assuming
purity
of
the
carbon
source
and
inclusion
of
appropriate
negative
controls
e.g.
incubation
in
the
absence
of
substrate
a
positive
result
is
unambiguous
and
may
be
interpreted
as
catabolic
i.e.
biodegradative
activity
coupled
to
cellular
growth
If
test
hydrocarbons
are
not
absolutely
pure
then
a
positive
growth
response
could
result
from
utilization
of
contaminant
hydrocarbons
However
this
possibility
was
unlikely
since
more
than
90
isolates
which
grew
on
toluene
as
a
sole
carbon
source
were
unable
to
utilize
this
same
substrate
when
it
was
present
as
a
contaminant
in
ethylbenzene
at
a
level
of
approximately
0.8
wt/wt

These
observations
suggest
that
the
concentrations
of
contaminant
hydrocarbons
were
insufficient
to
support
the
growth
of
gasoline-degrading
isolates
examined
in
this
study
As
in
all
studies
that
employ
growth
responses
on
singlecarbon
substrates
a
negative
result
may
be
interpreted
as
i
lack
of
a
functional
catabolic
pathway
or
transport
system
ii
insufficient
concentration
of
the
test
substrate
i.e.
inadequate
bioavailability
or
iii
biotoxicity
In
addition
a
negative
growth
response
does
not
imply
that
a
compound
can
not
be
cometabolized
or
syntrophically
utilized
It
may
be
argued
that
inadequate
bioavailability
was
not
responsible
for
negative
results
in
the
present
study
since
all
isolates
grew
on
gasoline
vapors
in
which
the
concentrations
of
individual
hydrocarbon
components
were
lower
than
those
of
the
single
test
hydrocarbons
subsequently
employed
In
addition
test
hydrocarbons
could
have
been
expected
to
approach
equilibrium
concentrations
at
the
surfaces
of
the
agar
plates
given
the
lengthy
incubation
periods
employed
Inadequate
bioavailability
may
also
be
discounted
on
grounds
that
different
isolates
in
the
same
subspecies
group
e.g.
P.
putida
in
AMBIS
group
33
often
displayed
different
catabolic
patterns
such
that
one
or
more
hydrocarbons
were
utilized
by
one
strain
but
not
by
another
To
account
for
such
discrepancies
in
substrate
utilization
it
must
be
postulated
i
that
significant
differences
existed
among
otherwise
closely
related
strains
with
regard
to
hydrocarbon
affinity
transport
kinetics
or
other
factors
that
could
restrict
bioavailability
or
ii
that
strains
exhibited
markedly
different
susceptibilities
to
the
biotoxic
effects
of
the
same
hydrocarbon
Whereas
strain
differences
in
specific-hydrocarbon
affinity
or
toxicity
are
admittedly
feasible
they
have
not
been
documented
nor
would
they
necessarily
be
expected
in
such
closely
related
isolates
Moreover
assuming
that
such
differences
did
exist
there
is
no
a
priori
reason
to
suspect
that
they
would
have
been
of
sufficient
magnitude
to
account
for
the
marked
differences
in
growth
responses
of
different
strains
on
the
same
hydrocarbon
Furthermore
it
may
be
inferred
that
none
of
the
15
test
hydrocarbons
was
generally
cytotoxic
at
levels
employed
in
this
study
otherwise
no
isolate
would
have
exhibited
growth
on
that
compound
In
contrast
every
test
hydrocarbon
was
found
to
support
the
growth
of
at
least
one
gasoline-degrading
isolate
However
since
biotoxicity
or
bioavailability
was
not
rigorously
proven
or
disproven
the
growth
response
data
tend
to
provide
a
conservative
estimate
of
catabolic
potential
Thus
catabolic
groups
defined
by
using
vapor-phase
growth
tests
might
have
hydrocarbon
catabolic
activities
other
than
those
actually
observed
Despite
this
inherent
conservatism
all
gasoline
hydrocarbon
categories
tested
were
found
to
have
been
directly
catabolized
under
aerobic
conditions
For
purposes
of
predicting
bioremediative
feasibility
at
a
hydrocarbon-contaminated
site
a
conservative
estimate
of
catabolic
potential
provides
a
safer
margin
for
error
than
a
more
liberal
estimate
of
degradative
ability
Given
the
qualifications
discussed
above
results
of
growth-screening
tests
and
other
methods
employed
in
this
investigation
indicate
that
there
was
considerable
physiologic
and
genetic
heterogeneity
among
gasoline-degrading
bacteria
associated
with
the
Seal
Beach
site
It
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
growth-screening
technique
employed
provided
greater
phenotypic
resolution
than
one-dimensional
protein-banding
information
since
a
total
of
111
catabolic
groups
were
defined
compared
with
51
AMBIS
groups
This
difference
was
not
entirely
unexpected
since
some
catabolic
enzymes
having
different
substrate
specificities
might
exhibit
similar
or
identical
mobilities
in
polyacrylamide
gels
Furthermore
many
catabolic
enzymes
may
be
present
in
cells
at
levels
too
low
to
be
readily
detectable
in
whole-cell
protein
preparations
thereby
precluding
their
use
as
discriminatory
signals
in
polyacrylamide
gels
It
is
noteworthy
that
different
members
of
the
same
species
e.g.
P.
aeruginosa
or
P.
putida
often
differed
significantly
with
respect
to
their
protein-banding
patterns
This
result
is
primarily
attributable
to
the
somewhat
arbitrary
use
of
a
conservative
correlation
limit
of
0.90
in
constructing
dendrograms
and
defining
isolate
groups
Delineation
of
AMBIS
groups
on
the
basis
of
a
lower
correlation
value
e.g.
0.75
would
have
resulted
in
broader
taxonomic
groupings
however
significant
discrepancies
between
banding
pattern
groups
and
conventional
identifications
would
still
have
occurred
Thus
the
use
of
onedimensional
protein-banding
pattern
analysis
to
reliably
infer
phylogenetic
relationships
was
limited
in
this
study
Evidently
protein-banding
information
is
not
always
adequately
conserved
for
this
purpose
even
at
the
species
level
Nevertheless
the
protein-banding
patterns
were
reproducible
and
isolates
composing
each
of
the
51
AMBIS
groups
were
consistently
identified
to
the
same
species
or
subspecies
Thus
protein-banding
information
must
be
viewed
in
this
study
primarily
as
a
means
of
resolving
strain
or
subspecies
differences
not
as
a
technique
for
inferring
phylogenetic
relationships
Results
of
growth
tests
indicated
that
isolates
displayed
a
predilection
for
aromatic
hydrocarbons
Aromatic
hydrocarbons
constitute
a
major
fraction
of
gasoline
24
and
these
compounds
are
more
water
soluble
and
less
volatile
than
many
aliphatic
constituents
These
characteristics
favor
the
prevalence
of
aromatic
hydrocarbons
in
groundwater
contaminated
by
gasoline
5
18
29
and
previous
GC
analyses
of
groundwater
samples
from
the
Seal
Beach
site
are
consistent
with
these
concepts
unpublished
data
Given
the
age
of
the
plume
6
years
it
seems
plausible
that
bacteria
at
the
site
might
have
had
adequate
time
for
significant
physiologic
and
genetic
adaptation
to
the
aromatic
fraction
which
is
consistent
with
the
observed
preference
of
the
isolates
for
this
hydrocarbon
category
The
majority
of
isolates
were
able
to
use
only
2
or
3
different
test
hydrocarbons
as
growth
substrates
Fig
3
This
observation
is
intriguing
since
it
may
reflect
an
optimum
level
of
catabolic
potential
that
is
inherently
maintained
by
cells
from
this
environment
Aside
from
arguments
concerning
unfavorable
energetics
there
is
no
a
priori
reason
to
expect
that
more
catabolic
activities
could
not
have
been
maintained
Indeed
a
number
of
catabolic
groups
included
individual
isolates
that
degraded
nearly
all
of
the
15
test
hydrocarbons
but
these
bacteria
represented
a
small
minority
It
is
interesting
to
speculate
on
the
purpose
of
maintaining
multiple
degradative
pathways
for
compounds
that
have
little
resemblance
to
one
another
e.g.
an
alkane
and
an
aromatic
It
is
not
known
whether
these
catabolic
pathways
are
simultaneously
expressed
and
active
in
the
environment
or
whether
certain
pathways
are
repressed
while
others
remain
functional
Additional
biochemical
and
physiological
studies
will
be
needed
to
resolve
these
questions

o-xylene
methylcyclopentane
and
cyclohexane
were
not
isolated
by
Jamison
though
each
of
these
hydrocarbons
was
biodegraded
by
a
consortium
growing
on
gasoline
suggesting
cooxidative
or
syntrophic
processes
It
is
possible
that
bacteria
existed
at
the
Jamison
site
that
could
directly
degrade
these
hydrocarbons
but
they
were
not
detected
because
of
the
low
number
of
isolates
screened
In
the
Jamison
investigation
isolates
were
obtained
from
groundwater
following
in
situ
injection
of
nutrients
and
oxygen
Thus
growth
of
aerobic
gasoline-degrading
bacteria
may
have
been
enhanced
relative
to
the
Seal
Beach
aquifer
which
is
anoxic
and
largely
depleted
of
inorganic
nutrients

nitrogen

In

Quantitative

as

as

BTEX
loss
as
measured
by
GC-FID
was
extensive
in
the
sediments
which
had
a
long
history
of
pollution
with
all
compounds
being
utilized
within
21–91
days
in
the
most
active
cultures
and
was
very
slight
or
non-existent
in
the
pristine
sediments
Also
the
pattern
of
loss
was
different
under
the
various
reducing
conditions
within
each
sediment
and
between
sediments
For
example
benzene
loss
was
only
observed
in
sulfidogenic
cultures
from
the
NY/NJ
Harbor
sediments
while
toluene
was
degraded
under
all
redox
conditions
The
loss
of
BTEX
was
correlated
to
the
reduction
of
the
various
electron
acceptors
In
cultures
amended
with
gasoline
the
degradation
was
much
slower
and
incomplete
These
results
show
that
the
fate
of
the
different
BTEX
components
in
anoxic
sediments
is
dependent
on
the
prevailing
redox
conditions
as
well
as
on
the
characteristics
and
pollution
history
of
the
sediment
The
monoaromatic
hydrocarbons
benzene
ethylbenzene
toluene
and
o-
m-
and
p-xylene
BTEX
are
constituents
of
petroleum
and
its
products
such
as
gasoline
and
diesel
fuel
Because
they
have
a
relatively
high
water
solubility
these
chemicals
readily
travel
from
spills
or
leaking
storage
tanks
into
groundwater
and
from
there
into
drinking
water
supplies
Benzene
is
of
particular
concern
as
a
pollutant
because
of
its
carcinogenicity
Dean
1985
The
others
are
toxic
to
varying
degrees
BTEX
also
moves
easily
into
sediments
and
other
environments
where
oxygen
is
limited
In
these
anoxic
environments
bacteria
may
use
nitrate
iron
sulfate
or
carbonate
as
an
electron
acceptor
while
degrading
organic
compounds
but
these
ions
can
not
take
the
place
of
oxygen
as
a
reactant
in
aromatic
ring
cleavage
Because
of
this
bacteria
have
had
to
evolve
novel
pathways
for
anaerobic
ring
cleavage
Harwood
Gibson
1997
The
BTEX
compounds
are
especially
difficult
to
degrade
because
they
lack
an
activating
oxygen
or
nitrogen
substituent
group
which
would
make
oxidation
of
the
ring
more
energetically
feasible
Although
biodegradation
of
these
hydrocarbons
has
been
conclusively
shown
to
occur
under
several
anaerobic
conditions
information
regarding
the
extent
of
this
activity
or
the
conditions
that
encourage
it
is
limited
The
capability
of
bacteria
to
anaerobically
biodegrade
BTEX
has
been
clearly
demonstrated
several
pure
strains
of
bacteria
which
mineralize
toluene
under
denitrifying
sulfidogenic
or
iron-reducing
conditions
have
been
isolated
for
a
review
see
Frazer
et
al
1995
as
have
denitrifyers
which
degrade
ethylbenzene
Although
this
activity
has
been
clearly
demonstrated
it
has
generally
been
found
only
in
highly
polluted
areas
Most
studies
have
focused
on
a
single
polluted
site
such
as
a
heavily
trafficked
harbor
or
an
aquifer
which
has
a
history
of
chronic
spills
Few
studies
have
examined
the
variability
in
biodegradative
capacity
between
different
sites
under
different
reducing
conditions
Kao
Borden

looked
at
BTEX
degradation
in
several
aquifer
sediments
both
polluted
and
clean
in
denitrifying
microcosms
They
found
that
some
inocula
resulted
in
loss
of
toluene
ethylbenzene
m-xylene
and
o-xylene
whereas
others
showed
no
or
reduced
activity
Variation

a

1996
and
Reinhard

at
a
gasoline
contaminated
aquifer
BTEX
loss
was
observed
under
denitrifying

Differences
were
seen
in
both
patterns
and
rates
of

Benzene
mineralization
in
particular
has
proven
to
be
an
elusive
activity

We
were
interested
in
finding
out
if
there
was
a
difference
in
the
degradation
of
BTEX
in
enrichment
cultures
established
under
identical
conditions
using
different
sediments
as

It
was
our
goal
to
determine
if
differences
between
contaminated
and
pristine
environments
would
have
an
effect
on
the

of

under

We
aim
to
comprehensively
compare
sediments
from
these
environments
in
microcosms
using
identical
protocols

and
incubation
conditions
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
effects
of
the
different
inocula
and
electron
acceptors
We
established
enrichment
cultures
using
sediment
from
four
different
sites
under
five
different

in
order
to
examine
the
effect
of
sediment
characteristics
and
electron
acceptors
on
BTEX
biodegradation
The

after

in

The
pattern
of
degradation
was
the
same
in
both
sediments
Toluene
and
m-xylene
in
OL
was
lost
within
the
initial
21
days
of
incubation
These
were
followed
closely
by
ethylbenzene
There
was
also
a
small
∼20–40
decrease
in
the
concentration
of
o-xylene
during
the

weeks

due

In

of

began
more

in
the
case

but
the

were

in
the
denitrifying

cultures
at
the
beginning
and

of

place
the
amount
of
electron
acceptor
loss
in
fed
cultures
above
that
in
un-fed
backgrounds
was
compared
to
the
amount
of
loss
that
would
be
expected
if
all
the
BTEX
were
mineralized
to
CO2
The
results
are
shown
in
Table
3
Values
ranged
from
73–75
of
expected
for
denitrifying
cultures
and
88–186
for
sulfidogenic
Because
of
the
small
amount
of
substrate
utilized
from
6–21
µmol
and
the
large
background
loss
in
some
cultures
it
is
difficult
to
obtain
good
estimates
for
these
values
They
are
however
in
general
agreement
with
the
hypothesis
that
the
BTEX
is
being
mineralized
rather
than
lost
by
some
other
process

Effects
of
gasoline
When
commercial
gasoline
was
used
as
the
substrate
degradation
of
BTEX
was
much
slower
and
less
complete
than
when
the
BTEX
was
added
alone
Figure

BTEX
fed
cultures
showed
complete
loss
of
all
six
compounds
in
less
than
150
days
In
contrast
gasoline
fed
cultures
showed
only
partial
loss
of
toluene
and
the
three
xylenes
and
no
loss
of
benzene
or
ethylbenzene
after
nearly
300
days
In
order
to
determine
which
components
of
gasoline
were
causing
the
inhibitory
effect
we
established
enrichments
containing

Degradation
was
not
significant
Although
previous
research
has
demonstrated
that
individual
BTEX
compounds
are
biodegradable
under
anaerobic
conditions
few
investigators
have
studied
the
differences
between
sites
or
the
effect
that
different
electron
acceptors
have
on
degradation
This
study
is
significant
because
we
have
tested
the
activity
from
several
sites
in
a
side-by-side
comparison
using
the
full
range
of
BTEX
components
as
substrates
Enrichment
conditions
were
identical
except
These
individual
values
were
then
summed
to
find
the
expected
nitrate
or
sulfate
loss
which
was
compared
to
the
actual
net
loss
in
the
active
cultures
for
the
inoculum
and
the
electron
acceptor
provided
This
allows
us
to
draw
conclusions
about
the
nature
of
the
microbial
populations
present
and
the
potential
for
bioremediation
We
have
shown
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
variability
in
the
fate
of
BTEX
in
anaerobic
sediments
with
the
rate
and
extent
of
loss
depending
on
the
inoculum
used
and
the
terminal
electron
acceptor
available
While
some
enrichments
resulted
in
complete
loss
of
all
six
compounds
e.g
AK-sulfidogenic
others
showed
no
activity
at
all
e.g
BML
–
all
conditions
Within
each
sediment
the
activity
was
affected
by
which
electron
acceptor
was
provided
Marine
cultures
had
robust
activity
under
sulfidogenic
conditions
while
only
freshwater
cultures
were
effective
under
methanogenic
Both
sets
responded
well
to
nitrate
addition
with
rapid
degradation
of
some
compounds
Furthermore
the
degradation
of
BTEX
was
severely
limited
by
the
presence
of
some
as
yet
unidentified
compound
or
compounds
in
gasoline
This
information
has
duplications
for
the
type
of
remediation
strategy
to
be
used
on
BTEX
spills
in
a
specific
area
depending
on
the
type
of
material
spilled

pollution

and
the

Hydrocarbon

the
organic

slight
or
lacking
in

of
the

conditions

with
the

The
rapid
utilization
of
toluene
under
all
reducing
conditions
is
consistent
with
many
reports
in
the
literature
including
Ball
Reinhard
1996
Barbaro
et
al
1992
Reinhard
et
al
1997
and
especially
Langenhoff
et
al
1996
who
showed
that
in
columns
filled
with
mixed
polluted
sediments
toluene
degradation
took
place
under
denitrifying
sulfidogenic
methanogenic
iron-reducing
and
manganese-reducing
conditions
There
were
no
organic-rich
unpolluted
sediments
or
organic-poor
polluted
sediments
included
in
this
study
so
it
is
not
possible
to
distinguish
between
the
effects
of
these
two
factors
Differences
in
substrate
utilization
due
to
the
available
electron
acceptor
were
evident
in
both
the
AK
and
OL
enrichments
The
most
rapid
loss
of
any
compounds
occurred
when
nitrate
was
added
as
the
terminal
electron
acceptor
but
the
loss
was
most
extensive
Iron-reducing
activity
was
similar
to
denitrifying
with
the
exception
of
o-xylene
being
degraded
instead
of
p-xylene
These
differences
are
in
contrast
to
the
results
of
Reinhard
et
al
1997
who
found
that
at
one
site
all
of
the
BTEX
compounds
with
the
exception
of
benzene
were
degraded
under
both
denitrifying
and
sulfidogenic
conditions
The
degradation
of
toluene

and
sometimes
p-xylene
without
loss
of
benzene

has
been

numerous
times

Interestingly
but
not
surprisingly
toluene
was
the
first
compound
to
be
lost
in
all
cultures
toluene
was
followed
by
ethylbenzene
and

in
denitrifying
cultures
and
o-

in
sulfidogenic
cultures
AK
Benzene
was
the
last
compound
utilized
Edwards
et
al
1992
also
found
toluene
and
m-xylene
to
be
the
preferred
substrates
when
BTEX
was
fed
to
a
sulfate-reducing
enrichment
They
found
in
contrast
to
our
results
however
that
o-xylene
was
consumed
after
p-xylene
In
denitrifying
cultures
from
both
AK
and
OL
there
is
some
evidence
that
o-xylene
is
being
cometabolized
during
toluene
degradation
The
concentration
of
o-xylene
decreased
approximately
10
relative
to
the
sterile
controls
during
the
first
three
weeks
of
incubation
when
toluene
degradation
was
occurring
but
did
not
change
afterwards
In
sub-cultures
of
the
AK
enrichment
the
addition
of
more
toluene
resulted
in
a
further
decrease
in
o-xylene
concentrations
data
not
shown
This
type
of
cometabolism
was
observed
by
Evans
et

1991
in
enrichment
cultures
and
later
in
a
pure
culture
of
strain
T1
Evans
et
al
1991b
The
transformation
of
o-xylene
in
T1
was
tied
to
the
production
of
2-methyl-benzylsuccinate
by
the
enzymes
responsible
for
toluene
metabolism
Evans
et
al
1992
Apparent
cometabolism
has
since
been
reported
in
other
studies
of
denitrifying
systems

and
the
by-products
have
been
isolated
from
contaminated
groundwater
where
sulfate
was
the
terminal
electron
acceptor
Beller
et
al
1995
Though
cometabolism
can
not
be
completely
excluded
from
these
consortia
o-xylene
metabolism
began
only
after
toluene
was
exhausted
suggesting
that
it
was
not
the
dominant
mechanism
of
degradation
It
is
significant
that
benzene
degradation
was
only
observed
in
cultures
from
one
site
AK
and
only
under
sulfidogenic
conditions
Benzene
degradation
has
previously
been
shown
to
occur
with
sulfate
as
the
terminal
electron
acceptor
in
four
separate
studies
one
of
which
used
the
Arthur

over
a
geological
time
scale
Phelps
et

researchers
have
noted
a
lack
of
degradation
in

under
the

The
lack
of
degradation
is
sometimes
ascribed
to
the
preferential
utilization
of
other
carbon
compounds
Edwards

an
observation
which
is
consistent
with
but
not
proven
by
the
observation
that
benzene
was
the
last
compound
to
be
degraded
in
our
experiments

in

It
appears
that
the
ability
to
anaerobically
degrade
benzene
is
not
widespread
throughout
the
environment
but
can
only
be
found
in
certain
sites
with
the
right
combination
of

hypothesis
that
these
aromatic
compounds
are
being
mineralized
to
carbon
dioxide
and
water
The
agreement
between
expected
and
predicted
values
was
best
in
the
AK-site
water
enrichment
107
where
the
largest
amount
of
BTEX
0.425
mM
was
lost
in
a
relatively
short
time
∼100
days
Ball
Reinhard
1996
observed
an
excess
of
from
2.4–6.6
times
the
amount
of
electron
acceptor
usage
over
what
would
be
required
to
mineralize
the
added
BTEX
in
their
microcosms
This
effect
was
accounted
for
in
our
study
by
subtracting
out
the
amount
of
nitrate
and
sulfate
reduced
in
un-fed
controls
The
values
that
we
obtained
in
these
background
controls
2.0–8.4
times
is
in
good
agreement
with
that
they
reported
The
amount
of
background
utilization
was
especially
high
in
the
denitrifying
cultures
and
this
made
it
difficult
to
obtain
good
estimates
of
the
actual
stoichiometry
Degradation
of
BTEX
was
much
slower
and
incomplete
in
cultures
amended
with
gasoline
than
when
BTEX
alone
was
added
Other
researchers
have
noticed
similar
results
when
feeding
gasoline
Barbaro
et
al
1992
Hutchins
et
al
1991b
There
are
many
possible
explanations
for
this
effect
Although
the
concentrations
of
BTEX
were
approximately
the
same
the
total
amount
of
hydrocarbons
in
the
gasoline
fed
cultures
was
much
higher
This
may
have
led
to
a
general
toxic
solvent
effect
on
the
whole
microbial
community
leading
to
a
longer
lag
time
or
these
other
hydrocarbons
may
have
been
degraded
preferentially
over
the
aromatics
It
is
also
possible
that
some
other
component
or
additive
in
the
gasoline
exerted
a
selective
toxicity
on
the
aromatic
degraders
Because
there
was
no
decrease
in
mineralization
of
the
background
organic
matter
as
indicated
by
electron
acceptor
loss
in
gasoline
amended
cultures
as
compared
to
un-fed
controls
data
not
shown
it
seems
likely
that
the
inhibitory
effect
is
not
directed
at
the
entire
microbial
community
The
results
of
an
experiment
where
various
components
of
gasoline
were
added
to
cultures
along
with
toluene
Figure
3
however
show
slower
rates
of
degradation
in
the
presence
of
alkanes
and
BTEX
but
that
the
inhibition
of
toluene
degradation
can
not
be
explained
entirely
by
the
presence
of
either
There
may
be
a
synergistic
effect
between
the
different
components
or
some
other
untested
compound
may
be
causing
the
lag
More
work
needs
to
be
done
to
determine
the
mechanism
behind
these
observations
We
have
shown
that
the
fate
of
BTEX
in
anaerobic
sediments
is
dependent
on
characteristics
of
the
site
including
its
pollution
history
and
the
terminal
electron
acceptor
available
Furthermore
the
degradation
of
BTEX
may
be
severely
limited
by
the
form
alone
or
as
a
component
of
gasoline
in
which
it
is
introduced
to
the
site
This
information
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
bioremediation
strategies
must
take
into
account
the
previous
history
and
other
characteristics
of
an
area
as
well
as
the
type
of
material
spilled
if
they
hope
to
take
advantage
of
native
microbial
communities
