Cells were harvested in the mid-exponential phase of growth by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C, washed twice with a sodium chloride solution (0.85%), and resuspended in the same solution containing 0.3% Tween 80 and 2% sodium alginate at a concentration of 12.4 mg of dry cells/ml. The mixture was then dropped into a 5% calcium chloride solution containing 0.3% Tween 80 to obtain beads of immobilized cells (about 1.0 mm in diameter). The beads were kept in the solution for 4 h at room temperature to ensure that they were rigid. Fifty grams of beads was added to 90 ml of a 0.85% sodium chloride solution containing 0.3% Tween 80 supplemented with 2% glucose as an energy source (7). Ten milliliters of gasoline was added for desulfurization, and thus the volumetric phase ratio of the aqueous phase to oil was 9. Dushanzi straight-run gasoline 227 (DSRG227) and DSRG275 were kindly provided by Petrochina Karamay Petrochemical Company. The numbers 227 and 275 refer to the concentrations of sulfur in the oil, in parts per million. BDS was performed for 24 h at 40°C in a 4-liter seal-capped bottle to ensure that there was enough oxygen. The oil was separated by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min (7). Nucleotide sequence accession number.The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain X7B has been submitted to GenBank and assigned accession number AF513815. Strain X7B is a nonmotile, non-spore-forming rod and has a 2-μm length and a 1-μm diameter. Its colonies are golden yellow, whereas colonies of the type strain of M. goodii, DSM 44492, are light ivory. The utilization pattern for 35 carbon sources was investigated. Because M. goodii was not included in the physiological database, strain X7B was assigned to Rhodococcus fascians, but with a similarity which was not sufficient for identification. High-performance liquid chromatography elution profiles of mycolic acids of X7B and M. goodii DSM 44492T were quite similar, indicating that the two strains belong to the same species. The GC chromatograms of X7B showed identical mycolic acid pyrolysis products, which indicated that both strains were the same. Strain X7B synthesized fatty acid patterns which are diagnostic for mycobacteria. A comparison of the fatty acid patterns synthesized by strain X7B and those synthesized by M. goodii showed that they were identical. Secondary alcohols (18:0 alcohol, 20:0 alcohol), which are diagnostic for some mycobacteria, could not be detected in either X7B or M. goodii. A comparison of the partial sequences of X7B revealed 99.5% sequence similarity to the type strain of M. goodii, DSM 44492 (EMBL accession no. Y12872). The RiboPrint pattern of strain X7B was different from that of M. goodii DSM 44492T. The phenomenon that mycobacterial strains of the same species are separated into two RiboPrint clusters has also been observed for some other Mycobacterium species (2). Based on comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing, chemotaxonomy, and morphological and physiological data, we can conclude that strain X7B belongs to the species M. goodii. Biodesulfurization of BTH by growing cells of M. goodii X7B.M. goodii X7B was able to grow in MAM with BTH as the sole source of sulfur. The strain showed maximum growth after 24 h of cultivation; thereafter, the biomass decreased a little, and the turbidity at 620 nm at this time point was 2.46. Broth that was sampled after 12 h of culturing with BTH was positive by the Gibbs assay (15), indicating the production of phenolic compounds. In order to elucidate the metabolic pathway of BTH by strain X7B, we extracted the metabolites of BTH with ethyl acetate and then analyzed them.
