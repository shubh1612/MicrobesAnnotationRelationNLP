Although the concentrations of BTEX were approximately the same, the total amount of hydrocarbons in the gasoline fed cultures was much higher. This may have led to a general toxic solvent effect on the whole microbial community leading to a longer lag time, or these other hydrocarbons may have been degraded preferentially over the aromatics. It is also possible that some other component or additive in the gasoline exerted a selective toxicity on the aromatic degraders. Because there was no decrease in mineralization of the background organic matter (as indicated by electron acceptor loss) in gasoline amended cultures as compared to un-fed controls (data not shown), it seems likely that the inhibitory effect is not directed at the entire microbial community. The results of an experiment where various components of gasoline were added to cultures along with toluene (Figure 3), however, show slower rates of degradation in the presence of alkanes and BTEX but that the inhibition of toluene degradation can not be explained entirely by the presence of either. There may be a synergistic effect between the different components or some other, untested, compound may be causing the lag. More work needs to be done to determine the mechanism behind these observations. We have shown that the fate of BTEX in anaerobic sediments is dependent on characteristics of the site, including its pollution history and the terminal electron acceptor available. Furthermore, the degradation of BTEX may be severely limited by the form (alone or as a component of gasoline) in which it is introduced to the site. This information leads to the conclusion that bioremediation strategies must take into account the previous history and other characteristics of an area, as well as the type of material spilled, if they hope to take advantage of native microbial communities.
