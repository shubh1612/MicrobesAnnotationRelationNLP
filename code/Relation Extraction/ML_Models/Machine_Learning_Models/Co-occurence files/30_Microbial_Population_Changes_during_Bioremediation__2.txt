Frozen samples from the field study were extracted and analyzed for PLFA and 16S rDNA DGGE profiles. Nonfrozen samples were analyzed by most-probable-number (MPN) techniques, to quantify the alkane- and aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading population changes over time. Results were used to determine how the degrading and nondegrading communities changed during the course of the 14-week experimental investigation and whether the community structure of the oiled plots was returning to the background control structure by the end of the test period. Such a return to prespill conditions would strongly indicate that the site was restored and that cleanup activities could cease. Experimental design.The site for the field study was located at Fowler Beach, Del., approximately midway between Dover and Rehoboth Beach. The bioremediation experiment was a randomized complete block design. Five replicate blocks of beach were marked off, each large enough (minimum length, 60 m) to accommodate four experimental units or test plots (each measuring 4 by 9 m). Treatments consisted of an unoiled control, a natural attenuation control (oiled with no amendments), an oiled treatment receiving nutrients, and an oiled treatment receiving nutrients and an indigenous inoculum of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms derived from the site. The four treatments were randomized in each of the five blocks. Details of the block layout, nutrient and oil application methods, and sampling procedures used are reported elsewhere (33, 34). Mineral nutrients (NaNO3 and Na5P3O10) predissolved in about 800 liters of seawater were applied daily via a sprinkler system. The amounts applied were 2 kg of technical-grade NaNO3 (330 g of N) and 128 g of Na5P3O10per plot. Once a week, 30 liters of a suspended mixed population of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria was also added to each of the inoculum plots (see below). For the unoiled and the natural attenuation plots, only seawater was applied through the sprinkler system. Nigerian Bonny light crude oil, previously weathered by aeration for 2 days, was applied at the rate of 136 liters/plot, resulting in a calculated crude oil contamination level of approximately 5 g/kg of sand. The oil was weathered by placing about 3 m3 in a 3.6-m-diameter plastic tank, connecting a pump and hose, and continuously spraying and recirculating the oil within the tank for 2 days to evaporate the light fraction. Inoculum preparation.The original culture consisted of a mixed consortium isolated from a nearby beach several months prior to the experiment and grown in the laboratory on Alaska North Slope crude oil previously weathered at 272°C to remove the light hydrocarbons. The culture was isolated by collecting a 500-g sample of sand from the surface of Slaughter Beach, approximately 1.5 km north of Fowler Beach, refrigerating it in a cooler, and shipping it to the laboratory for growth on the weathered Alaska North Slope crude oil in shake flasks containing Bushnell Haas medium supplemented with 20 g of NaCl per liter and 2 g of KNO3 per liter as the nitrogen source. The indigenous inoculum was prepared in the field by inoculating a portion of this culture into two 210-liter stainless steel drums containing 170 liters of seawater from Delaware Bay, the weathered Bonny Light crude oil (600 ml), and the same nutrients as used on the beach. Constant aeration and mixing were provided by a diffuser attached to an air pump. These enrichments were grown for 2 weeks at an ambient temperature. To allow weekly inoculation with fresh 2-week cultures, each drum was offset in time from the other by 1 week. Sampling.For hydrocarbon measurement, samples were collected from four separate sectors of each plot during each sampling event. Samples were collected in soil corers every 2 weeks for 14 weeks. Each sample was a composite of two cores, each measuring 7.6 cm in diameter and 15.2 cm in length, giving a sample wet volume of approximately 3 liters. The four samples from each plot were frozen on dry ice, shipped to Cincinnati, Ohio, and split into two subsamples, one for oil analysis and the other for archiving at −70°C. When the PLFA and DGGE analyses were performed, 25-g subsamples from the four archived samples from each plot were composited. Only three of the five replicate samples from weeks 0, 8, and 14 were analyzed for 16S rDNA, while all five replicate samples from weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 10 and 14 were analyzed for PLFA. MPN analysis.Sediment subsamples (∼300 g [wet weight]) from each plot were placed in Whirlpak bags, brought back under ice to the on-site mobile laboratory trailer, and immediately processed for MPN analysis of alkane- and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-degrading bacteria (39).
