The assA and bssA genes encode the catalytic subunits of the anaerobic glycyl radical enzymes, alkylsuccinate synthase (ASS; also known as methylalkylsuccinate synthase, MAS; Callaghan et al., 2008; Grundmann et al., 2008) and benzylsuccinate synthase (BSS; Leuthner et al., 1998), respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SuperMix (2X Dreamtaq, Fermentas) was used to set up 50-μL reactions containing 25 μL of 2X Dreamtaq mastermix, 0.4 μM of each primer, 5 μL of betaine (5 M stock), and 10 ng of DNA template. A modified touchdown PCR method (Muyzer et al., 1993) was used to minimize unspecific amplification. The cycling program was as follows: 95°C for 4 min followed by 2 cycles at each annealing temperature (i.e., 95°C for 1 min, 63–52°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2 min), 19 cycles at the plateau annealing temperature (53°C), and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 min. CONSTRUCTION AND PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF assA AND bssA CLONE LIBRARIES Polymerase chain reaction products were purified using the Qiaquick purification kit (Qiagen) and cloned into either pCRII or pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For each PCR product, colonies were picked into individual wells of two 96-well microtiter plates and grown overnight. Inserts of the correct size were sequenced using the M13R priming site. After sequencing, reads were trimmed to remove vector and primer sequences before further analysis. Sequences from each respective library were assembled into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of ≥97% sequence identity using Lasergene 7.2 (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA). The assA/bssA OTUs were aligned with assA and bssA genes from described strains for which complete sequences were available and the best BLAST matches National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Neighbor-joining trees were constructed in MEGA4 (Kumar et al., 2008) using the Tajima–Nei distance method, with pairwise deletion and performing 10,000 bootstrap replicates. The glycyl radical enzyme, pyruvate formate lyase (PFL), served as the outgroup. The DNA sequences of GoM assA and bssA OTUs were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers JX135105 through JX135128. METABOLOMIC EXTRACTIONS AND ANALYSIS Approximately 25 g of each core sample was thawed in 20 mL of double-distilled sterile water and then acidified with 10 N HCl until the pH was ≤2. Each sample was mixed with 100 mL of ethyl acetate and stirred overnight. The water phase was removed and the ethyl acetate solution was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, concentrated by rotary evaporation to approximately 2 mL and reduced further under a stream of N2 to a volume of 100 μL. Half of the extract was derivatized and analyzed by GC/MS as described previously (Aktas et al., 2010). The other half was analyzed by LC/MS with an Agilent 1290 UPLC and an Agilent 6538 Accurate-Mass Q-TOF with a dual electrospray ionization (ESI) ion source. A 5-μL volume of each concentrated ethyl acetate solution was introduced to a ZORBAX SB-C18 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.8 μm). A gradient method was used for the separation (0–3 min 15% acetonitrile, 3–25 min linear gradient to 95% acetonitrile in water). The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min, and the temperature of the drying gas was maintained at 325°C. The data were analyzed using the Agilent B.04.00 MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software. A positive identification of key metabolites, such as alkylsuccinates, alkylmalonates, alkylbenzylsuccinates, and alkanoic acids, required that these were observed with the correct mass (±1 ppm), as well as with the retention times and MS/MS spectra observed for standard compounds. In total, we sequenced 191.6 Mb from three deep-sea sediment samples collected after the DWH blowout (Table ​Table11), which included two sediment cores (GoM315 and GoM278) within 3 km of the DWH rig and one (GoM023) 127 km away (Figure ​Figure11). Post QC, 125.8 Mb were designated as high-quality sequences (252,082 individual reads), resulting in an average of 84,023 individual reads (average length of 491 bp/read) per deep-sea sediment core (Table ​Table11). PHYLOGENETIC CLASSIFICATION The MG-RAST classification tool revealed that at the domain level, all three samples had similar distributions. Bacteria (97–95%) dominated, while the archaea (4.2–2.2%) and eukaryotes (0.8–0.6%) contributed substantially less to the sediment communities. Differences among the three samples were observed when examined at the phylum level (Figure ​Figure22). The archaea associated with the deep-sea sediment cores were predominantly Euryarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, and Crenarchaeota (Figure ​Figure2A2A).
