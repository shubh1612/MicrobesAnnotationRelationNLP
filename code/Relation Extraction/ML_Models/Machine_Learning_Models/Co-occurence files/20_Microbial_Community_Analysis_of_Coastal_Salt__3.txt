Student’s t-test and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) were performed for sample comparisons. thumbnail Hydrocarbon Analysis Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were extracted from sediment (30–60 g) collected in June, July, and September according to the EPA SM5520 method and analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). TPH detection limit was 20 mg kg−1 for sediment samples. Tar balls and selected sediment samples (30–60 g) were extracted for n-alkanes with methylene chloride and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). The crude oil calibration curve was generated using a sample of Macondo oil (MC252) collected from the wellhead (provided by T. Hazen courtesy of BP). All hydrocarbon measurements were performed by Envirochem Environmental Laboratories, Mobile, AL. Results Site Water Parameters Water quality parameters measured during the June, July, and September 2010 sampling periods are summarized in Table 1. Water temperature averaged 33°C over the four month time period (∼1 m depth). Salinity ranged between 15 and 17 ppt in June and July and increased to 22 ppt in September. Dissolved oxygen saturation (DO) was highest (141%) in June and lowest in July (84%). DO increased to 110% in September 2010 (Table 1). Turbidity correlated with salinity and pH ranged between 7.5 and 8.5. Hydrocarbons Hydrocarbons were analytically detected in salt marsh sediments in June 2010. During sampling in July 2010, oil was present as a light sheen or mousse floating on the water and tar mats were observed mixed with wrack (organic debris) on the rush stands, marsh fringe, and shoreline. By early September 2010 oil was no longer visible in the water or along the shoreline of the marsh. TPH ranged from below detection (BD) to 189 mg kg−1 in the sediments and was highest at 20,300 mg kg−1 in tar balls (Table 2). TPH was distributed heterogeneously in the Inlet site samples as demonstrated by the wide range of values measured in replicate cores. TPH concentrations in June Inlet replicate cores were BD at the sediment-water interface within the 0–2 cm sections, however deeper in the core (8–10 cm) TPH varied from BD to 145 mg kg−1 suggesting that oil was randomly dispersed throughout the Inlet. July Inlet cores demonstrated similar heterogeneity with TPH ranging from BD to 164 mg kg−1 at the surface and BD to 64 mg kg−1 in subsurface sections. TPH was detected in surficial Inlet sediments in September (∼50 mg kg−1), but was BD at 8–10 cm depth. TPH in the June Marsh samples were more evenly distributed than in the Inlet samples, with TPH concentrations above detection in all replicate cores at both the surface and in the subsurface. TPH measurements varied within the replicates from 34 to 189 mg kg−1. July Marsh cores demonstrated a similar trend as June cores at the surface, with TPH ranging from 53 to 163 mg kg−1, but TPH decreased in subsurface sections ranging from BD to 33 mg kg−1. By September 2010 TPH was BD in all Marsh samples. thumbnail The range of TPH concentrations in Inlet samples was relatively constant in June, July, and September with the majority (50%) of samples ranging from BD to approximately 50 mg kg−1 (Figure 2). In contrast, the range of TPH in Marsh samples was distinctly different between the months with the majority of samples in June having TPH ranging from 50 to 175 mg kg−1. By July, the average TPH concentration decreased between 25 to 55 mg kg−1 and was below detection by September. Macondo oil (MC252) collected from the wellhead was analyzed by GCMS (Figure 3a). The light crude consisted of n-alkanes nonane (C9) to triacontane (C30) with higher concentrations of the short-chain hydrocarbons (C9 to C16) and decreasing concentrations of long-chain hydrocarbons (C17 to C30).
