The Euryarchaeota dominated (65%) in the sample closest to the DWH rig (GoM315), but the same taxon and the Thaumarchaeota were equally represented (45%) at GoM278. The Thaumarchaeota dominated (55%) in the sample most distant from the spill site (GoM023). Phylum-level organism classifications reveal differences among the three metagenomes sequenced in this study. (A) Archaea; (B) bacteria; and (C) eukaryotes. Within the bacterial domain (Figure ​Figure2B2B), Proteobacteria dominated (60–65%) all three sediment cores, followed by Firmicutes in GoM315 (9%), Bacteroidetes in GoM278 (11%), and Actinobacteria in GoM023 (7%). The eukaryotic sequences represented 21 phyla from the Animalia, Fungi, Plantae, and Protista kingdoms. The Animalia phyla Arthropoda (e.g., crab and shrimp) and Chordata (e.g., fish and sharks) increased in abundance as the distance from the DWH rig increased, while the Cnidaria (e.g., corals and sponges) and Nematoda (e.g., roundworms) phyla were found only at greater abundance in the two sediment cores closest to the DWH rig. Although the number of viruses was relatively low (0.17–0.01%), a greater number of viruses were associated with the two samples located nearest the DWH rig (GoM315 and GoM278) compared to the sample furthest away (Table ​Table11). Alpha diversity values calculated using annotated species-level distribution increased as the distance to the DWH rig lessened. However, other diversity indices revealed similar levels of both species in richness and diversity among the samples (Table ​Table11). The Proteobacteria associated with each sample were examined more closely in order to evaluate the potential for both aerobic and anaerobic oil biodegradation (Figure ​Figure33), since numerous Proteobacteria spp. are known to utilize petroleum hydrocarbons (Atlas, 1981; Widdel et al., 2010). The Gammaproteobacteria was the most diverse class with the Shewanella, Marinobacter, and Pseudomonas genera being the most common. Although the Gammaproteobacteria were similarly distributed (~33%), the distributions of both the Alphaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria varied among the three deep-sea sediment samples (Figure ​Figure3A3A). The Alphaproteobacteria, predominantly the Rhizobiales and Rhodobacterales orders (Figure ​Figure3B3B), contributed to the highest percentage (37%) of Proteobacteria spp. in the sample furthest from the DWH rig (GoM023), while the two closer samples (GoM315 and GoM278) contained 30 and 26%, respectively. Greater numbers of sequences associated with GoM023 were detected in numerous Alphaproteobacteria genera, including Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, Roseobacter, Roseovarius, and Rhodobacter. Deltaproteobacterial distributions revealed a wider range than the Gamma- and Alphaproteobacteria, one in which the two sediment cores closest to the DWH rig (GoM315 and GoM278) exhibited higher levels (26 and 30%, respectively), while the furthest core (GoM023) exhibited only 16% Deltaproteobacteria (Figure ​Figure3A3A). No single organism accounted for the shift in Deltaproteobacteria communities, rather a myriad of genera in the Desulfobacterales (e.g., Desulfatibacillum, Desulfobacterium, and Desulfococcus), Desulfovibrionales (e.g., Desulfovibrio), and Desulfuromonadales (e.g., Geobacter, and Desulfomonas) orders displayed higher levels in the GoM315 and GoM278 samples (Figure ​Figure3B3B). Differences are observed among the sites closest to the DWH rig and the site located over a 100 km away when examining more of the Proteobacteria. (A) Proteobacteria classes associated with each of the three sites reveals a decrease in the Deltaproteobacteria ... RECRUITMENT PLOTS Recruitment plots, comparing sequences from each metagenomic library to the genomes of specific organisms, supported the presence of known hydrocarbon-utilizing Proteobacteria (Table ​Table22). The analysis revealed a total of 169, 857, and 547 sequences, respectively, matching to features of the Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2 genome (Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Oceanospirillales, Alcanivoracaceae; Yakimov et al., 1998; Schneiker et al., 2006), the Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans AK-01 genome (Proteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Desulfobacterales, Desulfobacteraceae; So and Young, 1999; Callaghan et al., 2012), and the G. metallireducens GS-15 genome (Proteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Desulfuromonadales, Geobacteraceae; Lovley et al., 1993) in all three deep-sea sediment samples. Interestingly, matches to the aerobic hydrocarbon degrader, Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2 (51–61 sequence hits), remained consistent among all three samples; whereas, the comparison to the two anaerobic hydrocarbon degraders, Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans AK-01 (97–426 sequence hits) and G. metallireducens GS-15 (92–278 sequence hits), revealed a greater number of sequence matches to the two samples (GoM315 and GoM278) closest to the DWH well (Figure ​Figure44). Similarly, sequences recruited to Desulfococcus oleovorans Hxd3 (Table ​Table22), a model sulfate-reducing alkane/alkene utilizer, in all three samples; however, GoM315 and GoM278 recruited a greater number of sequences (256 and 332, respectively) compared to GoM023 (79). FUNCTIONAL GENE ANALYSIS All three samples revealed a similar functional blueprint at the broadest level of classification (Figure ​Figure5A5A). Genes coding for clustering-based subsystems (15–16%), amino acid and derivatives (9.2–9.3%), miscellaneous (8.2–9.5%), carbohydrates (8.8%), and protein metabolism (7.4–8.7%) represented the five most abundant categories when classified using the SEED database (Figure ​Figure5A5A). Analysis using COG classifications revealed a similar functional distribution, with the majority of sequences assigned to metabolism (45–46%), followed by cellular processes and signaling (19–21%), information storage and processing (17–18%), and poorly characterized categories (15–18%). There was genetic evidence in all three samples for the potential degradation of oil compounds, including genes vital to both the aerobic (e.g., mono- and dioxygenases) and anaerobic degradation (e.g., bss and benzoyl-CoA reductase) of compounds such as butyrate, benzoate, toluene, and alkanoic acids (Table S1 in Supplementary Material).
