Our data indicated significant differences among the microbial communities examined in this study compared to those detected prior to the DWH oil spill. Moreover, the metabolite profiling revealed significantly more putative metabolites in the two samples closest to the DWH site relative to the more distant background site. These findings were consistent with the metagenomic data showing an increase in the number of functional genes associated with anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation in samples closest to the DWH. Deep-sea sediment cores were collected by LBNL from the area surrounding the DWH oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico during six cruises by the R/V Gyre from September 16 to October 20, 2010 (Operational Science Advisory Team, 2010). An OSIL Mega corer (Bowers and Connelly) was used to collect deep-sea sediment cores, and overlying water was siphoned off using a portable peristaltic pump. The capped sediment cores were frozen at -80°C and shipped on dry ice to the LBNL where the cores were sectioned while frozen. The three cores utilized in this study were designated SE-20101017-GY-D040S-BC-315 (GoM315); SE-20101017-GY-D031S-BC-278 (GoM278); and SE-20100921-GY-FFMT4-BC-023 (GoM023). GoM315 and GoM278 were located near the DWH well (0.5 and 2.7 km, respectively), while GoM023 was located at a distance of 127 km from the DWH well (Figure ​Figure11). One-half of each core (GoM315, GoM278, and GoM023), approximately 5′′ diameter and 1′′ thick, was sent on dry ice to the University of South Carolina Baruch Marine Field Laboratory in Georgetown, SC, USA. Upon arrival they were further subsectioned in half using sterile razorblades in a biosafety hood. One half was used for DNA extraction and metagenomic analysis, while the other half was sent on dry ice to the University of Oklahoma (Norman, OK, USA) for metabolomic analysis.

DNA EXTRACTION Inside a biosafety hood, a sterile razor blade was used to cut a 3–4 g wedge from each of the three frozen cores (GoM315, GoM278, and GoM023). Community DNA was extracted from each core using a PowerMax® Soil DNA Isolation kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting DNA (~ 2 μg) from each sample was purified and concentrated via ethanol precipitation. The quality and quantity of the DNA were assessed via gel electrophoresis on a 2% agar gel with a 1 kb ladder and spectrophotometer analysis. METAGENOMIC SEQUENCING AND ANALYSIS Approximately 1 μg DNA (per core sample) was sent to Engencore (University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA), where high-throughput sequencing was performed using the Roche 454 FLX pyrosequencing platform. The sequencing results were recorded as SFF files and uploaded to the MetaGenome Rapid Annotation Subsystems Technology (MG-RAST) server for analysis (Meyer et al., 2008). Each file underwent quality control (QC), which included quality filtering (removing sequences with ≥5 ambiguous base pairs), length filtering (removing sequences with a length ≥2 standard deviations from the mean), and dereplication (removing similar sequences that are artifacts of shotgun sequencing). Organism and functional identifications were made using a BLAT [Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)-like alignment tool] search of the integrative MG-RAST M5NR database, which is a non-redundant protein database that combines sequences from multiple common sources. All identifications were made using a maximum e-value of 1e-5, a minimum identity cutoff of 50%, and a minimum alignment length of 50 bp. The hierarchical clustering/heat map comparisons were constructed in MG-RAST using dendrograms based on abundance counts for each category examined. Similarity/dissimilarity was determined using a Euclidean distance metric, and the resulting distance matrix was combined with ward-based clustering to produce dendrograms. Diversity indices for species richness and diversity estimates were calculated using EstimateS software (Colwell, 2006). Circular recruitment plots were created through the comparison of each metagenomic library to the whole genomes of reference organisms (Refseq genomes only) using a maximum e-value of 1e-5 and a log10 abundance scale. Three organisms of interest were investigated: Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2 (Yakimov et al., 1998; Schneiker et al., 2006; dos Santos et al., 2010), an aerobic gammaproteobacterium that utilizes oil hydrocarbons as its exclusive source of carbon and energy and is often the most dominant bacterium in oil-polluted marine systems (Harayama et al., 1999; Kasai et al., 2001; Hara et al., 2003; Yakimov et al., 2005), Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans AK-01, a sulfate-reducing, n-alkane and n-alkene utilizing Deltaproteobacterium (So and Young, 1999; Callaghan et al., 2012), and Geobacter metallireducens GS-15, a metal-reducing, aromatic hydrocarbon utilizer within the Deltaproteobacteria (Lovley et al., 1993). PCR AMPLIFICATION OF FUNCTIONAL GENES Sediment DNA from GoM315, GoM278, GoM023 was also interrogated with nine primer set combinations specific to assA and/or bssA (Callaghan et al., 2010).
