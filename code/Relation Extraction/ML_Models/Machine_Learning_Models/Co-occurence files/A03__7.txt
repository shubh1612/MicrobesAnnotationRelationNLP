The ratio of 14CH4 to 14CO2 from [2-14C]-acetate was 1:2, whereas this ratio is typically 4:1 in sediments in which methane production is the predominant terminal electron-accepting process. The actual ratio of 14CO2 to 14CH4 was 3:1 for [14C]-TBA oxidation. Therefore, it appears that, as with acetate, TBA was being converted to methane and carbon dioxide, by a variety of terminal electron-accepting processes. Implications for MTBE Remediation. There is increasing reliance on natural degradation processes to remove many petroleum contaminants from impacted subsurface environments (43). The results suggest that in some instances, anaerobic microbial communities may eventually develop which can degrade MTBE, but there are many sites at which this has not happened in a timely manner that would prevent significant spread of MTBE. Thus, methods for stimulating MTBE degradation in sediments are needed. This study suggests that, in some instances, it may be possible to stimulate the rate of anaerobic MTBE degradation. However, a much better understanding of the mechanisms for anaerobic MTBE degradation will be required before it will be possible to design reliable anaerobic bioremediation strate gies for MTBE.
