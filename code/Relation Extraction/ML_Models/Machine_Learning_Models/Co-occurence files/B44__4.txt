Thus, failure to grow was not a result of insufficient transfer of viable cells. Positive growth was interpreted as biodegradation of the test hydrocarbon (not necessarily complete mineralization) coupled with cellular growth, and the isolate was considered to exhibit catabolic activity. Growth of Pseudomonas putida (strain SB2-091686-54g) from the study site in a continuousflow, sand-filled column was correlated with removal of benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene as determined by GCFID analysis (unpublished data). These same hydrocarbons also served as sole growth substrates for this isolate in the vapor assay described above, indicating that growth on vapors could be used to infer actual catabolism of a hydrocarbon. Sample preparation for SDS-PAGE. Isolates were transferred from R2A medium to a defined radiolabeling (RL) medium and grown for 2 or 3 days at 28°C. RL medium contained the following reagents (all from Sigma): 0.1 g (each) of the amino acids arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, histidine, hydroxyproline, isoleucine, lysine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine; 50 mg (each) of the nucleic CATABOLIC ACTIVITY OF GASOLINE-DEGRADING BACTERIA acid bases adenosine, adenosine 2'- and 3'-monophosphate, cytidine 2'- and 3'-monophosphate, guanosine, guanosine 2'- and 3'-monophosphate, uridine, and uridine 2'- and 3'- monophosphate; 10.0 ,ug (each) of the vitamins p-aminobenzoic acid, D-biotin, folic acid, niacinamide, p-pantothenic acid, pyridoxal hydrochloride, pyridoxamine hydrochloride, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin hydrochloride, thiamine hydrochloride, and DL-6,8-thioctic acid; 1.0 g of glucose; 1.42 g of Na2HPO4; 1.36 g of KH2PO4; 5.0 mg of MgSO4 - 7H20; 2.8 mg of H3BO4; 1.8 mg of MnCl2 4H20; 1.36 mg of FeCl2; 1.77 mg of NaK-tartrate; 26.9 pLg of CUCl2 * 2H20; 20.8 ,ug of ZnCl2; 40.4 ,ug of CoC12 2H20; 25.2 jig of Na2MoO4- 2H20; 15.0 g of Bacto-Agar (Difco); and 1 liter of distilled water. The pH of RL medium was adjusted to 7.2, and vitamins were added after it was autoclaved as a filter-sterilized solution. Colonies were toothpicked from RL plates to 96-well microtiter plates, each well containing 100 pAl of sterile RL medium supplemented with 20 ,uCi of [35S]sulfate (specific activity, 25 to 40 Ci/mg; Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill.). Sulfate was employed as a label instead of [35S]methionine, since many isolates failed to efficiently incorporate the latter. Microtiter plates were incubated at 28°C in sterile, sealed plastic bags (to prevent evaporation) until growth was visible (usually 2 days). Cells were rinsed from wells with 50 pd of sterile, deionized water and transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and proteins were solubilized by addition of an equal volume of double-strength lysis buffer containing 0.125 M Tris buffer (adjusted to pH 8.3 with 2.0 N HCl), 4.0% (wt/vol) SDS, 10.0% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% (wt/vol) bromophenol blue (all from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.). This suspension was mixed, boiled for 5 min, and then sonicated for 5 min with an equal volume of 0.15-mm zirconium oxide beads by using a Heat Systems, Inc., model 450 ultrasonic processor equipped with a cup horn. SDS-PAGE method. Solubilized proteins were loaded onto 12% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gels and subjected to electrophoresis for 20 min at 20 W and then at 60 W for approximately 2 h at 8°C by using a refrigerated, computer-controlled electrophoresis system (AMBIS, Inc., San Diego, Calif. [14]). Gels were dried and scanned for radioactivity incorporated into cellular proteins with an AMBIS, Mark II, computer-programmed beta radioactivity scanner. A detailed description of this system has been reported by Hook et al-. (14) and Smith (25). Scanning and analysis of SDS-PAGE gels. Scan data were automatically retrieved and stored on the hard disk of an IBM-PC/AT microcomputer as individual SDS-PAGE lane files. Lane files were adjusted and normalized according to '4C-labeled molecular weight standards consisting of lysozyme (14,300 Da), ,-lactoglobulin (18,400 Da), carbonic anhydrase (29,000 Da), ovalbumin (43,000 Da), bovine serum albumin (68,000 Da), phosphorylase b (97,400 Da), and H-chain myosin (200,000 Da) (Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, Md.). The specific activity of a 1.0-,ul FIG. 2. Catabolic groups defined in this study. A filled box indicates that a hydrocarbon supported the growth of all members of a group. Asterisks denote a frequency of <0.01 (n = 297). BNZ, Benzene; TOL, toluene; OXL, o-xylene; PXL, p-xylene; TMB, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene; EBZ, ethylbenzene; NAP, naphthalene; HEX, hexane; OCT, octane; DEC, decane; TMP, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane; MBT, 2-methylbutane; CHX, cyclohexane; CHP, cycloheptane; MCP, methylcyclopentane; GAS, regular-grade unleaded gasoline. Solution of each 14C-methylated standard was 3,100 dpm/mg of protein. The length of each lane was adjusted and normalized by electronically clipping the ends of the lanes at two locations, one corresponding to phosphorylase b and the second corresponding to P-lactoglobulin.
