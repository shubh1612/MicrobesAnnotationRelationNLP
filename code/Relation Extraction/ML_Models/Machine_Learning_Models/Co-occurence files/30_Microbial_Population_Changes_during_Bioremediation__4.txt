Sequences that were of high frequency in clone libraries (at least 8 of 12 clones as defined by digestion pattern) and comigrated with the original band of interest were selected for sequence analysis (two clones band−1). Lipid analysis.All solvents used were of GC grade and were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, Pa.). Triplicate subsamples from each plot composite were extracted by using the modified Bligh/Dyer method as described previously by White et al. (35, 36, 37). The total lipids obtained were fractionated into glyco-, neutral, and polar lipids (9). The polar lipid fraction was transesterified with mild alkali to recover the PLFA as methyl esters in hexane (9). The PLFAs were separated and quantified by GC-flame ionization detection and identified by GC-mass spectrometry as follows. The fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by capillary GC with flame ionization detection on a Hewlett-Packard model 5890 series 2 chromatograph with a 50-m nonpolar column (0.2-mm inside diameter and 0.11-μm film thickness). The injector and detector were maintained at 270°C and 290°C, respectively. The column temperature was programmed at 60°C for 2 min, then ramped at 10°C per min to 150°C, and then ramped to 312°C at 3°C per min. The preliminary peak identification was done by comparison of retention times with known standards. Detailed identification of peaks was by GC-mass spectroscopy of selected samples with a Hewlett-Packard model 5890 series 2 gas chromatograph interfaced to a Hewlett-Packard model 5971 mass selective detector by using the same column and temperature program previously described. Mass spectra were determined by electron impact at 70 eV. Methyl nonodecanoate was used as the internal standard, and the PLFAs were expressed as equivalent peak responses to the internal standard. Fatty acid nomenclature is in the form of A:BωC, where A designates the total number of carbons, B the number of double bonds, and C the distance of the closest unsaturation from the aliphatic end of the molecule. The suffixes “-c” forcis and “-t” for trans refer to geometric isomers. The prefixes “i-,” “a-,” and “me-” refer to iso-, anteisomethyl branching, and mid-chain methyl branching, respectively, with cyclopropyl rings indicated by “cy” (15). Statistical analysis.Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine whether there were significant differences among lipid biomarker data obtained for the four treatments (6 sampling events × 5 replicates [n = 30]), with time (5 replicates × 4 treatments [n = 20]), oiled (3 treatments × 6 events × 5 replicates [n = 90]), and unoiled (1 treatment × 6 sampling events × 5 replicates [n = 30]) samples. ANOVAs were performed with Statistica, version 5.1, for Windows (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, Okla.). For chromatographic peak analysis, plots of log (average) versus log (variance) were used to determine the appropriate transformation of the variables (4). The square root transformation was chosen. A hierarchical cluster analysis (incremental linkage method) based on euclidean distance was performed on the means (n = 5) of the transformed data. Hierarchical and principal component analysis were performed with the statistical package Einsight (Infometrix Inc., Seattle, Wash.). Bioremediation.The first-order rate coefficients of the biodegradation results for the oiled plots are summarized in Table1. The nitrate-N concentrations naturally present within the interstitial pore water on Fowler Beach, Del., were high enough (mean = 0.8 ± 0.3 mg/liter [n = 96]) to sustain rapid natural attenuation rates in the unamended plots (−0.026 day−1 for alkanes compared to −0.056 day−1 for nutrient-amended plots; −0.021 day−1 for PAHs compared to −0.031 day−1 for nutrient-amended plots). Despite the high intrinsic biodegradation rates in the oiled controls, results from the biweekly samplings indicated that both the alkane and the PAH biodegradation rates in the nutrient- and inoculum-treated plots were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the unamended control but were not significantly different from each other (see reference33 for a detailed discussion). Less than 10% of the alkanes and 30% of the PAHs remained in the nutrient-amended plots after 6 weeks of exposure compared to approximately 35 and 45%, respectively, in the natural attenuation plots. MPN analysis.Data showing changes in densities of alkane and PAH degraders have been reported elsewhere (34). Briefly, the alkane degraders on the oiled plots were already at their maximum carrying capacity atT 0 (defined as the day on which amendments were first added, which was 4 days after oil had been applied to the plots), whereas on the unoiled plots they were about 2 orders of magnitude lower.
