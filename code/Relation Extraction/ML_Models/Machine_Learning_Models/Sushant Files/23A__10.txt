Although in the contaminated microcosms without nutrient treatment (0% N), no significant oil degradation occurred over the 28-day incubation period, remarkably, the bacterial communities changed considerably and the predominance of Alcanivorax/Fundibacter-like sequences in the corresponding clone library was apparent. This may be explained by the release of nitrogen and phosphorus from biomass killed by the oil, supporting limited hydrocarbon degradation. Interestingly, hydrocarbon pollutants can induce prophages, resulting in lysis of a large proportion of the bacterial community (9, 23), and this may explain changes in community composition independent of extensive oil degradation. Even in the absence of significant hydrocarbon degradation, Alcanivorax/Fundibacter-like sequences constituted about 40% of the clone libraries constructed from samples taken at days 6 and 26 from the unamended, oil-contaminated control microcosm. To assess if this is a consequence of relatively very low rates of hydrocarbon degradation by Alcanivorax/Fundibacter-like bacteria under these conditions, information on their activity would be required, for example, measurement of mRNA that encodes enzymes involved in biodegradation. The members of the Alcanivorax/Fundibacter group appear to have a cosmopolitan distribution, as their presence has been noted in coastal waters and on beaches of the United Kingdom (this study), Germany (5, 48), Italy (GenBank accession numbers AB0302701 to -4), Singapore (GenBank accession number AF062642), Japan (20, 25), and the United States (7, 32). They have been detected mainly in laboratory enrichments with oil components (5, 7, 20, 48), but more importantly, their occurrence in oil paste and seawater has been described following an oil spill in the Japan Sea (25). The worldwide distribution of Alcanivorax spp. indicates that they may be of considerable global significance in marine hydrocarbon degradation, and a project to sequence the genome of this important organism has recently been instigated (http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/presse/pm/engpm31.htm).
