These field studies were compared with results obtained from microcosms that were exposed to a range of gasoline concentrations. The selected field site was contaminated by petroleum products and is located beneath Bridge 270/4 in Pullman, Washington. The soil consists of sandy, gravely fill with coal fragments; over soft to stiff silt; over loose to dense, sandy, angular gravel; over basalt bedrock. A petroleum storage facility was at the site for more than 50 years, and in recent years an above-ground tank had been constructed after removal of an underground storage tank. Estimates of total volume of impacted soil range from 5,000 to 6,000 cubic yards, and concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons range from 2,000 ppm to less than 1 ppm [22]. Soil samples were taken in July 1992, from 15 boreholes at depths from 4 to 6 feet for most boreholes, and from 4 to 11 feet for one borehole. Boreholes were 10 feet apart, and covered both the contaminated area and soil adjacent to the contaminated area. A total of 46 soil samples were collected along two transects (Fig. 1). These two transects were chosen to include contaminant concentrations ranging from very high to undetectable contamination. Soil samples were placed on ice immediately following collection and immediately transported to the laboratory for strain isolation and storage at −20°C for later soil DNA extraction. Surface soils (10–30 cm, silty loam) were collected from the campus of Washington State University, Pullman, Washington. After parMolecular tial air drying, soils were sieved (2-mm-diameter openings) for uniform consistency, and water was added to the soil to adjust the moisture content to 70% of its water-holding capacity. Four hundred grams of soil was mixed with unleaded gasoline (Chevron, 87[) at concentrations of 0.5, 5, 35, 75, or 125 mg fuel/g soil (in triplicate). Each gram of unleaded gasoline contained 85.5 mg toluene, 19 mg ethylbenzene, 69.9 mg m-xylene, 26 mg o-xylene and p-xylene, and 0.7 mg naphthalene, as analyzed by gas chromatography (see below). The treated soil was placed into 2-liter beakers in a layer approximately 3-cm thick. Soils without addition of fuel were used as control samples. The beakers were covered with thin polyethylene film (Saran Wrap) to reduce evaporation and were stirred twice per week during room temperature incubation. Ten grams of soil was taken from the beakers at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 16 weeks after inoculation and immediately stored at −20°C. DNA was extracted at a later date. Analysis of Aromatic Compounds The total petroleum hydrocarbons were extracted from all soil samples using a supercritical fluid extractor (Model SFXTM 2-10; ISCO Inc., Lincoln, Neb.). The extraction conditions were modified from the standard method [10, 12], as follows: pressure, 350 atm; oven temperature, 80°C; restrictor temperature, 150°C; CO2, 60 ml; collection solvent, 5 ml hexane; soil, 3 g fresh sample. The extraction efficiency was determined to be approximately 65%, using [14C] naphthalene spiked into the soil prior to extraction. Internal standards and reference standards from the Internal Standard Mixture for EPA Methods 8240/CLP (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) were added to the extractant. Aromatic compounds (naphthalene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) were analyzed by gas chromatography using an Auto System GC (Perkin Elmer Co., Norwalk, Conn.) with a 30-m (0.25-mm diameter) fused-silica capillary column (Restek Co., Belletonte, Pa.). The GC parameters were as follows: injection port, 250°C; flame ionization detector, 250°C; column, 40°C, 1 min, programmed to 200°C with a rate of 8°C/min, hold 2 min; injection volume, 1 µl. Extraction and Purification of Total Soil DNA The method for extracting and purifying DNA from soil was a modified method based on direct cell lysis [34, 35]. Extracellular DNA was removed and the soil dispersed as follows: 1–5 g soil was placed in 50-ml Oak Ridge tube containing 10 ml 0.12 M buffer sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 (SP buffer), vortexed for 1 min, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Soil was centrifuged for 10 min at 7,700 g. Supernatants were decanted and 10 ml SP buffer was added to the soil pellet.
