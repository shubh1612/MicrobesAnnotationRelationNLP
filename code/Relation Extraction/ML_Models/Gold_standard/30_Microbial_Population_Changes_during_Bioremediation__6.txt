By week 10 the PLFA profiles of the oiled unamended samples more closely resembled those of the unoiled controls. A similar shift was observed for the PLFA profiles of the nutrient- and inoculum-amended plots by week 14. The best example of this was in the background unoiled versus inoculated PCA (Fig. 4). The scatter plots for the loadings of the individual PLFA showed the same patterns as those described for the whole data set in Fig. 3. Physiological status.The lipid profiles of microorganisms are a product of the metabolic pathways and consequently reflect the phenotypic response of the organism to its environment and any changes therein (38). Gram-negative bacteria maketrans-monounsaturated fatty acids as a result of changes in their environment, e.g., exposure to solvent (12, 23, 26,27), toxic metals (7), or starvation (10,16). The physiological status of gram-negative communities can be assessed from the trans/cis ratios of the PLFA, with ratios of less than 0.05 shown to be representative of healthy, nonstressed communities (37). Irrespective of sampling time, thetrans/cis ratios for the oiled samples were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than for the unoiled background samples (Fig. 5). PCR-DGGE analysis of bacterial community structures.PCR-DGGE analysis of bacterial community structure was carried out on three of the five replicate plots at weeks 0, 8, and 14. Banding patterns are shown in Fig. 6A, B, and C. A neighbor-joining dendrogram showing the relationships of the sequences recovered from prominent bands is shown in Fig. 7. At time zero (Fig.6A) all samples generated a simple banding pattern of no more than seven visible bands. The derived sequences from these bands (Dw1 to Dw7) suggested dominance of the community by gram-positive microorganisms related to the genus Planococcus (Dw2, Dw3, Dw5, and Dw6). Gram-negative microorganisms were represented by three bands, either within the Flexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroidesphylum (Dw7) or closely related to the genera Psychrobacterand Moraxella within the Î³ subgroup of the proteobacteria (Dw1 and Dw4). At week 8, reproducibility among the replicates from the oil-treated samples was at a low level and showed no obvious relation to additional treatment. Representative patterns are shown in Fig. 6B, derived from three of the plots treated with both nutrients and inocula. All bands visible at time zero remained strong in some plots within each treatment but had disappeared from others to be replaced by highly complex banding patterns. Novel bands that appeared during the course of the experiment are shown in Fig. 6B and C. The appearance of novel bands in the unoiled plots consisted of four bands (Dw11, Dw12, Dw13, and Dw22). Dw11 and Dw12 showed relationship to the gram-positive genera Exiguobacterium and Planococcus, respectively, and appeared in one or more of the unoiled sample plots at week 14 (Fig. 6C). Dw13 and Dw22 represented members of the Bacteroides-Flexibacter-Cytophagales phylum. Dw13 also appeared in the unoiled plots at week 8. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences derived from bands that appeared specifically in oil-treated plots revealed that one was related to gram-negative species within theFlexibacter-Cytophaga-Bacteroides phylum (Dw15).
