PCR conditions were as described above for primers 338F and 907R except that PCR mixtures were not treated with UV and the PCR temperature profile included touchdown primer annealing (12) from 65 to 55°C (decreasing 0.5°C per cycle) for 20 cycles, followed by 10 cycles at 55°C. Geobacteraceae 16S rDNA amplicons were analyzed by DGGE on a 55 to 70% denaturant gradient, and individual bands were excised, checked for heteroduplexes, reamplified, and sequenced as described above. For analysis of the dominant members of the bacterial community, partial 16S rDNAs were amplified from triplicate sediment DNA samples by using primers 338F-GC and 907R as described above. In order to improve detection of faint bands in subsequent DGGE analyses, 200 ml of the resulting PCR product from each sediment DNA sample was concentrated by lyophilization. Concentrated PCR products were then resolved by DGGE and reamplified as described above, except that gel denaturant gradients consisted of 30 to 70%, 50 to 70%, and 60 to 80% denaturant. MPN-PCR analysis of sediment Geobacteraceae. MPN-PCR analysis of Geobacteraceae 16S rDNA at the methanogenic site was conducted as previously described (4). Sequence analysis. 16S rDNA sequences were checked for potential chimeras with the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) CHECK_CHIMERA program and by determining the secondary structure of selected sequences. Sequences were then aligned with closely related 16S rRNA sequences from GenBank and the RDP. Unambiguously aligned base positions were used to calculate Jukes-Cantor distances and construct phylogenetic trees with the maximum-parsimony and least-squares methods. PLFA analyses. PLFAs were extracted from sediment samples by adding 142.5 ml of methylene chloride-methanol-phosphate buffer (monobasic, pH 7.0) (1:2: 0.8) to 70 g (wet weight) of sediment, followed by sonication for 2 min and incubation for 3 h at room temperature. The extractant was then separated from the sediment by centrifugation and transferred to a clean tube. The remaining sediment was washed with 37.5 ml of methylene chloride, and the resulting extractant was combined with the previous fraction. Then, 37.5 ml of sterile distilled water was added to the extractant and, after thorough mixing, the organic and aqueous phases were separated by centrifugation. The lower (organic) phase was removed by pipetting it to a clean tube and then dried under a stream of N2. Total lipid was fractionated as described by Guckert et al. (17). PLFA were then transesterified into methyl esters (17) prior to identification and quantification by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (38). Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. Sequences were deposited in Gen- Bank under accession numbers AF104267 to AF104299. Distribution of benzene mineralization potential and MPNPCR of Geobacteraceae. Anaerobic benzene mineralization under in situ conditions was negligible at the uncontaminated site and in the methanogenic sediments, with less than 6% of the [14C]benzene added recovered as 14CO2 after 85 days. This result contrasted with the mineralization of more than 60% of the added benzene in sediments from IR-3 and was comparable to the very slight benzene mineralization that was also observed at IR-1 and IR-2 (4). MPN-PCR analysis indicated that there were 2.2 3 105 6 7.8 3 104 (mean 6 the standard deviation) copies of Geobacteraceae 16S rDNA g21 in the methanogenic sediments. This finding compared with previously reported estimates of Geobacteraceae 16S rDNA of 1.48 3 103 6 1.04 3 103 copies g of sediment21, 9.24 3 104 6 3.49 3 104 copies g of sediment21, and 9.24 3 104 6 3.49 3 104 copies g of sediment21 in the background site and at sites IR-1 and IR-2, respectively, but it was significantly lower than the 1.50 3 107 6 6.72 3 106 copies g of sediment21 for Geobacteraceae previously found at site IR-3 (4). PLFA analysis of microbial community. PLFA concentrations were highest at site IR-3 (170.6 pmol g21), decreased at sites IR-2 and IR-1 (32.2 and 65.0 pmol g21, respectively), and lowest at the uncontaminated site (7.9 pmol g21).
