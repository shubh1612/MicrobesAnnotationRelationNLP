Nutrient and dissolved oxygen analysis.The beach sediments were highly water saturated, and a syringe was used to remove interstitial water that remained immediately following removal of sediment samples. Samples (10 ml) of pore water from within the plots were filtered with a 0.2-μm-pore-size filter, transferred into acid-washed tubes, and kept frozen at −20°C until analysis. Inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the seawater were determined by using a Technicon autoanalyzer system (16). A Horiba water quality analyzer equipped with an oxygen electrode was used to determine dissolved oxygen concentrations in the field. A fresh sediment sample was removed, and the probe of the water analyzer was used to measure dissolved oxygen in the pool of water that remained when the sediment sample was taken. Oil chemistry.During every sampling event, three sampling locations per plot were randomly selected. Sediment samples (50 g) were excavated, transferred into steel containers, and kept frozen at −20°C for oil chemistry analysis. Hydrocarbons in oil-treated sediments (10 g), spiked with squalane and 1,1-binaphthyl standards to determine the extraction efficiency, were extracted, analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection and mass spectrometric detection, and quantified as described previously (27). On average, the recovery efficiency of the added standards was 83%. Replicate analyses showed that the variability of measured values was always less than 10%. To distinguish between physical removal of oil and biodegradation, the levels of total petroleum hydrocarbons, total gas chromatography-resolvable hydrocarbons, n-C11 to n-C35 alkanes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were expressed relative to the amount of 17α(Η),25β(Η)-hopane, a degradation-resistant compound present in crude oil (6). Statistical analysis of chemical data.Statistical analysis (parametric two-way analysis of variance) was performed by using Systat 7.0 (SPSS Inc.). Nucleic acid extraction.During every sampling event, three samples (20 g) were randomly collected from each plot by using a grid and kept frozen at −20°C until extraction and analysis. After thawing and homogenization, DNA and RNA were extracted from 0.6-g samples, which were mixed with 0.6 ml of 0.12 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 80 μl of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.6 ml of phenol (pH 8.0) in Ribolyzer tubes (bacterial matrix; Hybaid, Ashford, United Kingdom). The tubes were agitated in a Hybaid Ribolyzer for 15 s at 5.5 m/s, incubated at 65°C for 30 min, and agitated again for 15 s at 5.5 m/s. After centrifugation, the supernatant was extracted once with 0.5 ml of phenol and once with 0.5 ml of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1; pH 8.0). Nucleic acids were precipitated by adding 0.1 volume of 3 M sodum acetate (pH 5.5) and 0.6 volume of isopropanol to the supernatant. The mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h and centrifuged (10 min, 14,000 × g) to recover the precipitated nucleic acids. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol at −20°C and, after air drying, was dissolved in 100 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl-1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0). For rRNA isolation, 50 μl of the nucleic acid extract was cleaned with an RNeasy column (Promega, Madison, Wis.) used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Residual DNA was removed by DNase treatment (20 U of DNase I [Boehringer-Roche, Mannheim, Germany]) for 2 h at 37°C. After DNA digestion, the extract was again cleaned with an RNeasy column. PCR without the reverse transcriptase step was performed with the RNA extract, and extracts not giving rise to a PCR product were subsequently used for reverse transcriptase reactions. All solutions were prepared with sterile diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Bottles and plastic ware were baked for at least 4 h at 180°C. DGGE analysis.RNA was converted to cDNA by using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer and primer 3 (18), which corresponded to positions 534 to 517 in Escherichia coli 16S rRNA. PCR was performed in a 50-μl (total volume) mixture containing 0.2 μM primer 2 (18) (corresponding to positions 341 to 358 in E. coli 16S rRNA), 0.2 μM primer 3, each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at a concentration of 0.2 mM, 1 U of BioTaq enzyme, buffer supplied with the enzyme (Bioline, London, United Kingdom), and 1 μl of cDNA template. Amplification was performed with a Hybaid Omnigene thermocycler as follows: 95°C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 0.5 min, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min and a final elongation consisting of 72°C for 10 min. DGGE was performed with the Bio-Rad DCode system.
