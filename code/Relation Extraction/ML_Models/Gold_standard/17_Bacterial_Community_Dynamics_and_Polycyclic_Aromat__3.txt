Preliminary data for independent triplicate microcosms showed that the Pearson correlation moment vector (r) calculated from the relative band intensities of DGGE profiles for treatments 1M, 2M, and 4M (after 0 and 200 days of incubation) was more than 0.85. These data indicated that there was homogeneity in each treatment. Hence, DNA was extracted from a composite 0.75-g sample containing 0.25 g of each microcosm replicate. PCR.The V3 to V5 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified using primers 16F341-GC and 16R907 (40). Primer F341-GC included a GC clamp at the 5′ end (5′-CGCCCGCCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGTCCCG CCGCCCCCGCCCG-3′). All PCRs were performed with a personal Mastercycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Fifty microliters of the PCR mixture contained 2.5 U of TaqGold (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at a concentration of 200 μM, each primer at a concentration of 0.5 μM, and 100 ng of template DNA quantified by means of the Low DNA Mass Ladder (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD). After 9 min of initial denaturation at 95°C, a touchdown thermal profile protocol was used, and the annealing temperature was decreased by 1°C per cycle from 65°C to 55°C; then 20 additional cycles at 55°C were performed. Amplification was carried out with 1 min of denaturation at 94°C, 1 min of primer annealing, and 1.5 min of primer extension at 72°C, followed by 10 min of final primer extension. PCRs were done in duplicate using template DNA from soil microcosm composite samples, and then the mixtures were combined prior to DGGE analysis. DGGE.Approximately 800 ng of purified PCR product quantified by using the Low DNA Mass Ladder (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD) was loaded onto a 6% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gel that was 0.75 mm thick (to obtain better resolution), and the denaturing gradients used ranged from 35 to 70% denaturant (100% denaturant contained 7 M urea and 40% formamide). DGGE was performed in 1× TAE buffer (40 mM Tris, 20 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA; pH 7.4) using a DGGE-2001 system (CBS Scientific Company, Del Mar, CA) at 100 V and 60°C for 16 h. The gels were stained for 45 min in 1× TAE buffer containing SybrGold (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), viewed under UV light, and analyzed using Image Master (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). Analysis of DGGE images.Images of DGGE gels were digitized, and DGGE bands were processed using the Quantity-one image analysis software (version 4.1; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and manually corrected. After normalization of the gels, bands with relative peak area intensities greater than 2% were included in further analyses. Bacterial diversity was assessed using the Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H′), calculated as follows (15): H′ = −Σ Pi log Pi, where Pi is the relative peak area intensity of a DGGE band, calculated from ni/N, where ni is the peak area of the band and N is the sum of all peak areas in the densitometry curve. Furthermore, a covariance principal-component analysis (PCA) of band types and peak heights was carried out for treatments 1M, 2M, and 4M to consider possible shifts in the composition of the microbial populations. The effect of bioaugmentation (treatment 6M) on the microbial diversity of the soil was assessed by comparing the DGGE profiles for treatments 1M (untreated), 4M (nutrients added), and 6M (nutrients and inoculum added) by a similarity cluster analysis. A dendrogram was constructed using the unweighted pair group method with the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient calculated from the complete densitometric curves for fingerprints of soil bacterial community microcosms. The PCA and similarity cluster analysis were performed using the Excel application StatistiXL, version 1.4. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis bands.Predominant DGGE bands were excised with a sterile razor blade, resuspended in 50 μl sterilized MilliQ water, stored at 4°C overnight, reamplified, cloned in the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced by using an ABI Prism Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing reaction kit, version 3.1 (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and an ABI 3700 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and following the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences were edited and assembled using version 4.8.7 of the BioEdit software (17), inspected for the presence of ambiguous base assignments, and subjected to the Check Chimera program of the Ribosomal Database Project (24) before the sequences were examined with the BLAST and RDP search alignment tool comparison software (4, 24). Statistical analysis.Data were subjected to analysis of variance using the Statgraphics Plus package (version 5.1; Statistical Graphics Corp., Manguistics Inc., United States). Duncan's multiple-range test of means, with a significance level of 0.05, was applied to the results to determine their statistical significance. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers.The 38 nucleotide sequences identified in this study have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers AY58562 to AY758599. Previous Section Next Section RESULTS Soil properties.The soil was a loamy clay soil containing 40% clay, 28% silt, and 32% sand. The total organic carbon and total nitrogen contents were 4.2% and 0.15%, respectively; the inorganic nitrogen content was 20 mg kg−1 nitrate and 2.8mg kg−1 ammonium, and the phosphate content was low (less than 1 mg kg−1). The soil had low conductivity (228 μS cm−2), the pH was 7,5, and the water content was extremely low (1.6%). Conversely, the soil had a high WHC (27.7%), possibly due to the high clay content. The PAH degraders accounted for up to 12% of the total heterotrophic microbial population, with 1.8 × 105 cells g (dry weight) of soil−1.
