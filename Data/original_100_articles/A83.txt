The properties and characteristics of predicted polypeptides
of the CB3 car locus are summarised in Table

and are particularly low. Sequence analysis reveals
that the aromatic ring dioxygenase enzyme from CB3
is a class II type three-component enzyme similar to
biphenyl dioxygenase [27] and toluene dioxygenase
[17]. This is disparate to the carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase
from CA10 [6] which is a three-component enzyme
belonging to the class III type similar to naphthalene
dioxygenase [29].
The terminal oxygenase component of the carbazole
dioxygenase from CB3 putatively encoded by carAaAb
consists of two subunits akin to those of biphenyl dioxygenase
[27], naphthalene dioxygenase [29] and toluene
dioxygenase [17] which is also disparate to the single

subunits. Since the specificity of the initial dioxygenases
