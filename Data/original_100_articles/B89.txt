Summary. By enrichment and isolation techniques bac- 
terial strains with the capacity to grow on aliphatic cyc- 
lic ethers (dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,3-dioxolane) 
have been isolated. Six strains that degrade tetrahydro- 
furan were classified as belonging to the genus Rhodo-
coccus. One of two strains that degrade dioxane instead 
of or in combination with tetrahydrofuran was further 
characterized and a hypothetical catabolic pathway 
comprising an initial 2-hydroxylation and several oxi- 
dation steps is postulated. 

Introduction 

While numerous publications deal with the microbial 
degradation of furan (Trudgill 1984), the information 
on biological degradability of the saturated cyclic eth- 
ers, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, trioxane, 1,3-dioxolane 
and others, is scarce. Such structures may occur in nat- 
ural compounds but are used in large quantities as sol- 
vents and chemical bulk products. Because of their 
high vapour pressure and water solubility, significant 
amounts will be released into the environment. Their 
fate is uncertain. In the assessment of biodegradability 
of fourteen chemicals tetrahydrofuran was classified as 
"not readily biodegradable" (Painter and King 1985), 
but there have been other publications on the degrada- 
tion of dioxane (Orlowska et al. 1984) or tetrahydrofu- 
ran (Dimitrenko et al. 1987; Gvozdyak et al. 1988). 

We report the isolation of strains with the ability to 
degrade unsubstituted and substituted saturated cyclic 
ethers from the environment and describe the growth 
characteristics and substrate specificities of a strain be- 
longing to the genus Rhodococcus.

Materials and methods 

Organisms. All strains mentioned in Table l were isolated from 
enrichment cultures using liquid mineral medium A containing 
various carbon sources in concentrations from 0.02 to 0.05%. After 
several transfers in liquid medium a sample was transferred to nu- 
trient broth agar. Pure isolates were conserved by lyophilisation. 

Culture media and growth conditions. The media used were: mi- 
neral medium A (Trower et al. 1985); nutrient broth agar (Difco, 
Detroit, Mich., USA); seed medium (Thaler and Diekmann 1979). 
All incubations were at 30 ° C, in test tubes fixed at 45 ° inclination 
or in erlenmeyer flasks on a rotatory shaker at 175 rpm. 

Analytical methods and techniques. Optical density (OD) was de- 
termined at 578 nm, and dry weight after collection of the sample 
on membrane filters, drying at 105°C for 1 h and weighing. 
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was measured with the test kit 
LCK414 (Dr. Lange, Berlin, FRG). For the gas chromatographic 
determination of dioxane and tetrahydrofuran a Shimadzu (Kyo- 
to, Japan) GC-9 AM equipped either with a Poropak Q (80/100) 
column or a Chromosorb W-HP column coated with 5% OV-17 
100-200 mesh were used. The Gram stain was performed with the 
colour set of BioMerieux (N~rtingen, FRG), and the quinones 
were separated and identified according to Kroppenstedt (1982). 

Chemicals. Dioxane and tetrahydrofuran were from Merck 
(Darmstadt, FRG). All other chemicals used for the degradation 
tests were purchased from Aldrich-Chemic (Steinheim, FRG) or 
were a gift from BASF (Ludwigshafen, FRG). 

Results and discussion 

Enrichment and isolation of strains 

Mineral media containing dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or 
other cyclic ethers (see Table 1) as sole carbon sources 
in erlenmeyer flasks were inoculated with samples from 
forest soil or sludge from the settling basin of the aero- 
bic waste-water purification plant of a chemical firm, 
When an increase in OD could be observed, cells were 
transferred to fresh media. After repeated transfer in li- 
quid media and dilution streaks on solid media a num- 
ber of pure strains were isolated (Table 1). Despite con- 
siderable efforts no strains were enriched or isolated

Incubation at 30 ° C in silicone-stopper-covered test tubes contain- 
ing 10 mM carbon source in 5 ml mineral medium 

when dioxane or cyclohexane were the carbon sub-
strates. 

The enrichment, which was based on the method of 
Parkes (1982), led to a great number of strains capable 
of limited but significant growth on aliphatic oxygen 
heterocyclic substrates. Strains degrading dioxane-2,3- 
diol, tetrahydropyran, -4-ol and -4-one have not yet 
been studied in detail. Studies with strains degrading 
tetrahydrofuran-3-ol will be published elsewhere. 

Characterization of tetrahydrofuran-degradino isolates 

The six tetrahydrofuran-degrading strains showed iden- 
tical morphological characteristics and were Gram-po-
sitive. Extraction and analysis of respiratory quinones 
revealed menaquinone-8 in all strains. From a compari- 
son with R. rhodnii DSM 43336 and R. terrae DSM 
43 249 the isolates were preliminarily classified as be- 
longing to the genus Rhodococcus (Lechevalier 1986). 
Their ability to grow on different substrates was com-
pared (Table 2). 

For further studies strain 219 was selected because 
of fast growth in minimal and complex media and its 
ability to degrade dioxane as well. The optimal temper- 
ature was 30 ° C and the optimal pH range was 6.5-7.0. 
At 7.5 mM tetrahydrofuran the maximal growth rate (~) 
was 0.019 h -1 and the degradation rate was 28.5 mg te- 
trahydrofuran, h -1. g-1 dry weight at a yield (Yx/c) up 
to 0.55 (dry weight/substrate carbon). Tetrahydrofuran- 
and dioxane-degrading ability was not lost during 
growth on complex media up to an OD578 of 75, there- 
fore it seems unlikely that the initial enzyme is plasmid- 
encoded. After growth in complex media, a lag-phase 
of up to 24 h was observed, but there was no indication 
that the enzyme system for degradation was inducible. 

Above a concentration of 10 mM (0.72 g-1-1) tetra- 
hydrofuran the lag phase was prolonged, and the 
growth rate and yield reduced, but growth was not to- 
tally inhibited. Growth could be observed with as little 
as 0.22raM (16mg-I -l) tetrahydrofuran. Figure 1 
shows the disappearance of tetrahydrofuran and diox- 
ane in shake cultures. At the end of the logarithmic 
growth phase no tetrahydrofuran or dioxane could be 
detected by gas chromatography. The COD measured 
in the supernatant after centrifugation was zero, mean- 
ing that no intermediates had accumulated and the sub- 
stances were totally mineralized. 

The ability of Rhodococcus strain 219 to grow on dif- 
ferent oygen-or nitrogen-containing compounds was 
tested with the 34 compounds listed in Table 3. In tests 
when combinations of tetrahydrofuran and dioxane or 
butan-l,4-diol were used as carbon sources it was 
shown that neither compound inhibited the degrada-
tion of the other. 

The hypothetical catabolic pathway shown in Fig. 2 
is in accordance with the list of compounds attacked by 
strain 219. Preferred substrates are cyclic ethers unsub- 
stituted in the a-position to the ring oxygen. The pre- 
sumed primary products of tetrahydrofuran or dioxane 
degradation, namely tetrahydrofuran-2-ol and dioxane- 
2-ol have not been identified yet and an initial dehydro- 
genation as hypothesised for the degradation of pyrrol- 
idine (Jacoby and Fredericks 1959) and morpholine

netics. Mineral medium A (100 ml) containing 10 mM carbon sub- 
strate in a 500-ml baffled erlenmeyer flask, covered with a silicone

tion was at 30 ° C and 175 rpm on a rotatory shaker. Samples were

dococcus sp. strain 219. Substrates degraded (see Table 3) are 
shown in bold structural formula: 1, tetrahydrofuran; 2, butyro- 
lactone; 3, butan-l,4-diol; 4, succinic acid 

all tetrahydrofuran-3-ol-degraders cannot grow on te-
trahydrofuran (not shown). 

2. Butyrolactone is a substrate metabolized as fast as 
tetrahydrofuran. 
3. It was reported that a diureticum of the type 2-
alkyl-2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran is metabolised in the rat 
via a hydroxylation at the C-atom adjacent to the ether 
oxygen (Meng and Kroneberg 1967). 
4. Dioxane-2-one was identified as the major urinary 
metabolite ofp-dioxane in rat (Woo et al. 1977). 
5. By 2-hydroxylation and subsequent oxidation of the 
secondary alcohol to the ketone a lactone emerges that 
is a common intermediate in the degradation of cyclic 
hydrocarbons formed by Bayer-Villiger oxidation of 
the cyclic ketone, for instance cyclohexanone (Abril et 
al. 1989).
