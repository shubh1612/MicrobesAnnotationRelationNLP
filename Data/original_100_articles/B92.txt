Abstract: The effects of culture conditions in uitro and biosurfactant detection were studied on bacterial strains capable of degrading
gasoline from contaminated soils near gas station. The main results were summarized as follows. Three bacteria (strains QlO, 414 and
QIS) that were considered as efficiently degrading strains were isolated and identified as Pseudomonas sp., Flauobacteriurn sp. and
Rhodococcus sp., respectively. The optimal growth conditions of three bacteria including pH, temperature and the concentration of
gasoline were similar. The reduction in surface tension was observed with all the three bacteria, indicating the production of
biosurfactant compounds. The value of surface tension reduced by the three strains QlO, 414 and Ql8 was 32.6 mN-m, 12.4 mN-m
and 21.9 mN .m, respectively. Strain QlO could be considered as a potential biosurfactant producer. Gasoline, diesel oil, benzene,
toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) could easily be degraded by the three isolates. The consortium was more effective than the
individual cultures in degrading added gasoline, diesel oil, and BTEX. These results indicate that these strains have great potential for
in situ remediation of soils contaminated by gas station leaking.

Introduction
Worldwide concern is increasing over the
environmental pollution by petroleum leaked from
underground storage tanks (USTs) of gas stations.
There are approximately 3 X lo6 of USTs storing
petroleum products in the USA, and as many as 5 X
1 O5 of USTs may be leaking petroleum into the ground
(EPA, 2001; Rothenstein, 2003). This problem is
especially acute in China, although there are not clear
data about it (Xue, 2003).
Contamination of soil and groundwater by
gasoline and other petroleum-derived hydrocarbons
released from USTs is a serious and widespread
environmental problem. Great attention has been paid
to human and environmental safety, concerning the
release of hydrocarbons to the environment. Gasoline
contains benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene
(BTEX) isomers, which are hazardous substances
regulated by many nations (Alvarez and Vogel, 199 1;
Ribeiro et d., 2005). In addition to BTEX, other
gasoline constituents such as methyl-t-butyl ether
(MTBE), 1, 3, 5-trimethylbenzene (1, 3, 5-TMB), and
1, 2,4- trimethylbenzene (1, 2, 4-TMB) are also toxic
to humans.
Microbial biodegradation is considered as a
major process that accounts for both containment of
the petroleum-hydrocarbon plume and the reduction
of leaking contaminant concentrations. Many bacterial
strains capable of degrading petroleum pollutants have
been isolated. Sorkhoh et al. (1993) isolated two
strains of B. stearothemophilus which was able to
degraded 80%-89% of crude oil (5 g/L) within 5 d at
60°C. Ijah and Antai (2003) reported the isolation of a
Bacillus strain from highly polluted soil samples
which was able to rapidly degrade crude oil. Rather,
there was a great deal of specialization and
interspecies interaction and very few organisms could
degrade a single compound completely. Degradation
of petroleum compounds was often the result of
community-interacting microbial populations,
generally termed as a consortium (Alexander, 1980).
However, few studies were conducted to isolate and
characterize bacteria capable of degrading
hydrocarbon leaked from gas stations. The main
objectives of this study were to isolate and
characterize gasoline-degrading bacteria in
contaminated soils, to establish optimum conditions
for the growth of isolated bacteria, to determine
excreting-biosurfactants ability of bacteria, and to
compare degradation ability of individual bacteria and
consortium for gasoline, diesel oil, benzene, toluene,
xylene and BTEX.
1 Materials and methods
1.1 Sampling site and enrichment cultures
The bacterial strains used in this study were
isolated from soils contaminated by a 4-year-old gas
station in Beijing, China. Soil samples were collected
near the underground storage tanks (about 2 m depth)
and stored in closed containers at 4°C prior to use.
All microbial enrichment and isolation were
performed in the media prepared from the following
composition (g/L): NH,Cl 0.1, MgCl, -6H20 0.08,
K2HP0, 0.25, CaC1,.2H20 0.1. Gasoline was added as
the sole carbon source to autoclaved basal medium (at
the rate of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/L, respectively).
The pH of the inorganic culture media was adjusted to
7.0 with either HCl or NaOH.
1.2 Isolation and characterization of bacteria
An enrichment culture technique was used to
isolate gasoline-degrading bacteria. The medium
containing soil and gasoline was incubated at 35T
with orbital shaking (120 r/min). An aliquot of 1 ml of
the medium was transferred every day to the same
type of sterile medium and incubated under the same conditions.
After four transfers, 1 ml was diluted and
placed on agar plates of basal medium containing 500
mg/L gasoline and incubated for 48 h at 30°C in
darkness. The well-growth bacterial colonies were
purified on the same medium.
Well-separated colonies from each medium were
assayed for their degrading ability in universal bottles
(25 ml) containing basal medium plus gasoline, as
appropriate, which were incubated on a shaking
platform at 120 rimin at 30%. The concentrations of
gasoline were determinated by infrared spectrophotometer.
The most efficient bacteria were selected
and streaked again onto fresh gasoline-containing agar
plates and nutrient agar plates to ensure purity.
Cell morphology, mortality, Gram-reaction and
physiological characteristics of the purified cultures
were examined under a light microscope.
1.3 Determination of optimum temperature, pH
and substrate concentration for the growth of
isolated bacteria
The influence of pH, temperature, substrate
Concentration and some hydrocarbons on the growth
of selected isolates was assessed using basal medium,
each with three replications. The autoclaved medium
was adjusted to pH 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0
using predetermined amounts of 1 mol/L HCI or 1
mol/L NaOH and incubated at 30°C. The incubation
temperatures were 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40°C. and the
gasoline concentrations were 0, 125, 250, 500, 1000
and 2000 mg/L.
The inocula, containing 5% of the total volume,
were sampled in the logarithmic phase cultures in
basal medium broth and incubated for 24 h with
orbital shaking ( 120 r/min). After incubation for 24 h,
1 ml of medium was diluted and 0.1 ml of the lo-',
1 0-3 and 10" dilutions were plated on nutrient agar and
incubated for 24 h at 30°C in darkness and colonies
werc directly counted and expressed as CFU/ml.
1.4 Surfactant detection
lhe surfactant produced by thrcc isolatcs were
tested by the reduction of surface tension. The surface
tension was measured by model ZHY-180
tensiometer. Evaluation was performed by the
presence and absence of cells which were removed by
centrifugation at 10000 r/min for 30 min at 4°C. In this
experiment the surface tension of basal medium was
68.7 mN.m.
1.5 Microbial consortia preparation and degradation
The microbial consortia was formulated by
mixing equal proportions of all purc bacterial cultures
that were isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated
soils.
In ordcr to obtain a standard inoculum, individual
bacteria were grown for 24 h on Tryptone Soy Broth
at 30°C on an orbital shaker at 120 r/min. The cells
were then harvested by centrifugation, rinsed thrcc
times in stcrile salinc water before being resuspended
in sterile basal medium to yield an absorbance reading
of 0.5 at 600 nm. When used as an inoculum at 10%
(v/w), the resulting colony forming unit (CFU)/g soil
was around 1.6 X 10' CFU/g.
1.6 Substrate degradation by isolates and
consortium
In order to test the degradation ability, isolates
and consortium were added into several glass flask
containing 500 mdL gasoline, diesel oil, and RTEX,
respectively. The incubation were carried out at 30°C
with an orbital shaker at 120 rimin for 48 h. Then the
concentration of gasoline were determinated.
1.7 Control experiment
Considering the volatility of gasoline, in all
experiment sterile controls containing gasoline or
BTEX compounds, but no cells, were used to monitor
abiotic losses of organic compounds.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Isolation and identification of bacterium
Nineteen preselected bacteria were isolated from
gas station leaking contaminated soils, which were
able to grow well using gasoline as the sole source of
carbon. Among them, three strains (QlO, Q14 and
Ql8) were the most efficient in degading gassoline
(data not shown).
Physiological characteristics of the three isolates
were examined. The bacterial colonies of strain Q 10
were circular, low-convex, gray, smooth and shining.
The bacterial colonies of strain Q14 were typically
circular, smooth, yellow with regular and complete
margins. The bacterial colonies of strain Q18 were
low-convex, dryness with uncomplete margins. The
details of other morphological and physiological
characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
According to the morphological and biochemical
properties, strains Ql0, Q14 and Ql8 were tentatively
classified as Aeudomnas sp., FlnvoOculerirtrn sp. and
Rhodococcus sp., respectively.
concentration for growth
In order to determine the optimal growth
conditions for the selected isolates, including
temperature, pH and gasoline concentration were
evaluated.
Fig.1 shows the growth response of three strains
QlO, Q14 and Q18 to different temperatures. Three
strains showed similar response to temperature. At the
beginning, the numbers of bacteria increased but
decreased later with temperature rising. The largest
biomass of bacteria of strains QlO and Q14 were
found at 30T, but was at 35°C for strain Ql8.
Although temperature could increase substrate
bioavailability, but higher temperature would also had
adverse effects on the development of cell.

different initial pH value is shown in Fig.2. The
highest cell number of the three strains were found at
pH 6.0. When initial pH value was above 6, the
numbers of strains QlO and Q14 decreased quickly.
But Q18 decrease slowly until initial pH value above
7. Therefore, the optimum pH value for 3 strains
growth was around 6.0 showing that a neutral to
slightly acidity pH may be required for the growth of
cells. But for strain Q18 slightly alkalescence pH was
also tolerable.
The effect of gasoline concentration on cell
growth was revealed in Fig.3. The three isolated
strains (Q 10, Q14 and Q 18) showed similar response
to gasoline concentration. Their cell numbers
increased with increasing concentrations of gasoline
up to 1000 m a . When the concentrations were
above 1000 m a , the numbers of bacteria decreased,
but the decreasing trend was slow. These results
suggest that 1000 mg/L was the optimum

concentration of gasoline for strains QlO, 414 and
QlS, and these isolates had a great utilization ability
of gasoline.
2.3 Biosurfactant production
Oil compounds have a low solubility in water,
which baffled microbial degradation. However, many
microorganisms have some mechanisms to produce
biosurfactant, which could increase the dissolution
flux of the substrate and reduced the difficulty of the
substrate coming into bacteria cells (Cameotra and
Bollag, 2003). In general, biosurfactant production
was estimated by the reduction in surface tension of
the medium free of cells after growing in the substrate.
Results arc listed in Table 2.
The reduction of surface tension was obsereved in
all the three strains. The value of surface tension
reduced by strains QlO, Q14 and QlS was 32.6, 12.4,
and 21.9 mN -m, respectively. Strain QlO caused the
greatest surface tension reduction and it could be
considered as a potential biosurfactant producer
(Desai and Banat, 1997). The emulsification
phenomenon was not found in this study and these
three isolates did not produce high molecular weight
iosurfactants.
This biosurfactant-excreting ability of strains
QlO, Q14 and QlS may have greatly enhanced the
degradation of gasoline, especially in situ remediation
because the bioavailability and biodegradation of
gasoline would be increased by biosurfactant and in
hture biosurfactant would play more role in oil
compound degradation.
2.4 Other substrate degradation ability
These isolates grew well on basal medium
containing diesel oil, and BTEX. The degradation
efficencies of strains QlO, Q14 and Ql8 on gasoline,
diesel oil and BTEX after 48 h inoculation were listed
in Table 3.
Strain Q10 had the greatest degradation ability for
gasoline, toluene and o-xylcnc, with an efficiency of
62.69'6, 72.8% and 66.7%, respectively, but it had less
degradation ability for benzene, with an efficiency of
28.3% (Table 3). Strain Ql8 was the most active
against diesel oil, benzene, ethylbenzene, with an
degradation efficiency of 5 1.2%, 8 1.6% and 83.5%,
respectively. But it was the least against o-xylene and
the degradation efficiency was 4.8%. The degradation
ability of strain Q14 was between strain QlO and
strain Ql8.
In general, these three strains had a great ability

to degrade gasoline and other oil compounds.
Therefore, in hture these strains (QlO, Q14 and Q18)
maybe have Beat applying prospect in spot
remediation of gas-station-leaking contaminated soils.
2.5 Substrate degradation by consortium
Because microorganism had different degradation
ability to different compounds and gasoline or other
oil product contained complex hydrocarbon,
biodegradation of those hydrocarbon usually requires
the cooperation of more than a single species. In our
experiments, assemblages of mixed populations were
conducted. The degradation efficiency of the
consortium, containing equal proportions of the three
isolates, on gasoline, diesel oil and BTEX are listed in
‘Tablc 3.
The comparison of the degradation potentials of
the mixed and pure cultures revealed that the mixed
culture was more effective than the pure cultures in
degrading gasoline, diesel oil and BTEX. The
degradation efficencies of gasoline, diesel oil,
benzene, toluene, o-xylene and ethylbenzene were
82.2%, 62.4%, 91.6%, 84.5%, 70.1% and 91.5%,
respectively.
The consortium, consisting three strains isolated
from gasoline contaminated soil could effectively
degrade hydrocarbons and was more effective than
pure cultures in biotreatment systems. Because the
three isolates exhibited a biodegradation pattern that
was a subset of that exhibited by the mixed culture
and interspecies interactions may be necessary for the
complete biodegradation of multicomponent hydrocarbon
mixtures such as gasoline. However, the types
of microorganism and hydrocarbon mixtures may
determine the rate and extent of hydrocarbon
remediation. And these all needed to explore in
fiirther studies.
Three efficiently degrading strains (strains Q10,
Q14 and Ql8) were isolated and identified as
Aeudomonus sp., Hmohncterium sp. and Rhodococcus
sp., respectively. The optimal growth conditions of
three bacteria including pH, temperature and thc
concentration of gasoline were similar. All the three
could excrete biosurfactant during degrading gasoline.
And strain QlO could be considered as a potential
biosurfactant producer. Gasoline, diesel oil and BTEX
could easily be degraded by the three isolates. The
consortium was more effective than the individual
cultures in degrading added gasoline, diesel oil, and
BTEX. These strains may have great potential for in
situ remediation of soils contaminated by gas station
leaking.
