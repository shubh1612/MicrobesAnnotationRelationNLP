Saturated hydrocarbons are quantitatively the most abundant fraction among all petroleum hydrocarbons. Signiﬁcant advances have been made in the understanding of the anaerobic biodegradability of
alkanes in terms of the microorganisms involved and the biochemical pathways over the past two
decades. They can be used as carbon and energy sources by diverse physiological groups of microorganisms (isolates or consortia) grown under chlorate-reducing, nitrate-reducing, suﬁdogenic or methanogenic conditions. Two general biochemical mechanisms have been proposed for the initial activation
of alkanes including addition of fumarate and carboxylation. However, glycyl radical enzymes dependent
fumarate addition which yields alkyl-substituted succinate appear to be the most commonly shared
mechanism for the anaerobic attack of alkanes under various redox conditions by phylogenetically
diverse microorganisms. The genes encoding the candidate alkylsuccinate synthase have been recently
described in alkane-degrading sulfate- and nitrate-reducers as well as in hydrocarbon-rich environments. Alternative mechanisms may also be available depending on the alkane-degrading microbial
community and electron acceptors utilized.

1. Introduction
Petroleum (crude oil) is a complex mixture that contains thousands of distinctively different chemical components, but mainly
hydrocarbon. Hydrocarbon composition of crude oil can be separated into four main fractions; namely saturated hydrocarbons,
aromatic, resins and asphaltenes. These compounds are relatively
less reactive due to the lack of functional groups and low water
solubility. Nevertheless, microorganisms can grow with hydrocarbons as the sole source of carbon and energy coupled with different
electron acceptors. However, the initial attack of hydrocarbons
remains the critical step for the subsequent metabolism of these
apolar substrates. Furthermore, the incorporation of molecular
oxygen into the hydrocarbon molecules by the activity of oxygenases in the initial step is a strictly oxygen-dependent biochemical process and energetically favorable (Chakraborty and Coates
2004; Wentzel et al. 2007). However, biodegradation of hydrocarbons in the absence of molecular oxygen is often hindered by the
chemical inertness of the carbonecarbon bonds. Obviously, microorganisms capable of anaerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons
must have developed alternative, oxygen-independent biochemical

reactions and the required enzymes for the initial attack of these
substrates under oxygen-limited conditions. Today, anaerobic
degradation of hydrocarbons remains an interesting area of
research for understanding the mechanisms of petroleum biodegradation in oil reservoirs, and for bioremediation of oil-contaminated environments. Major attention has recently been paid to the
microbial ecology of petroleum reservoirs, where anaerobes are the
dominant microorganisms (Magot et al. 2000; Röling et al. 2003; Li
et al. 2007). Isolation and/or characterization of such microorganisms are of great importance for understanding of the biochemical
mechanisms responsible for oil biodegradation in natural environments and in petroleum reservoirs.
The anaerobic biodegradability of hydrocarbons has been
investigated since the 1940s, however, the biodegradation/
biotransformation of these compounds in the absence of molecular
oxygen was conclusively demonstrated only about two decades ago
via methanogenesis of toluene and benzene (Vogel and Grbic-Galic
1986; Grbic-Galic and Vogel 1987). Later on, toluene was shown to
be completely oxidized to CO2 by pure cultures of the Fe(III)reducing Geobacter metallireducens strain GS-15 (Lovley et al. 1989).
These studies led the way to the isolation and characterization of
novel microorganisms capable of oxidizing a diverse range of
hydrocarbons under the dominant terminal electron accepting
processes occurring under anoxic environments including sulfate,
nitrate, oxidized metals e such as iron(III) and manganese(IV) e

and CO2 (Heider et al. 1999; Widdel and Rabus 2001; Chakraborty
and Coates 2004).
Biodegradation of alkanes in anoxic environments has been for
years a subject of debate only at the theoretical level. The ﬁrst
experimental demonstration of this hypothesis was accomplished
by the quantitative measurement of the consumption of n-alkanes
by sulfate-reducing bacteria (Aeckersberg et al. 1991). Since then,
sulfate-, nitrate- and chlorate-reducing bacteria grown anaerobically with saturated hydrocarbons as the sole carbon and energy
sources have been demonstrated. Furthermore, the isolated anaerobic alkane-degrading microorganisms were not closely related to
previously established species, e.g., Desulfovibrio or Pseudomonas
strains, and revealed novel species or genera (Aeckersberg et al.
1991; Aeckersberg et al. 1998; Ehrenreich et al. 2000). In addition,
anaerobic biodegradation of alkanes has also been supported with
enriched microbial communities utilizing sulfate (Kropp et al. 2000;
Gieg and Suﬂita 2002; Savage et al. 2010) and nitrate (Bregnard et al.
1997; Callaghan et al. 2009) as the terminal electron acceptor, or
under methanogenic conditions (Zengler et al. 1999; Anderson and
Lovley 2000; Gieg et al. 2008; Jones et al. 2008).
The main scope of this review lies on the diversity and physiology of microorganisms capable of anaerobic degradation of
alkanes under nitrate, sulﬁdogenic, chlorate and methanogenic
conditions. No studies have been reported on the degradation of
alkanes under iron-reducing conditions so far. For biodegradation
of aromatic hydrocarbons, current information is available in
reviews by Chakraborty and Coates (2004), Foght (2008) and
references therein. Given the scope of the current review, a brief
overview of the anaerobic metabolism of alkanes is provided, with
emphasize on the predominant role of glycyl radical enzymedependent fumarate addition which results in the formation of
methyl branched alkylsuccinates.
2. Anaerobic degradation of alkanes
Alkanes that have been shown to be biodegradable under anoxic
conditions can be classiﬁed into linear (general formula CnH2nþ2),
branched (general formula CnH2nþ2, n > 3) and cyclic (general
formula CnH2n, n > 2). From a thermodynamic point of view,
anaerobic biodegradation of alkanes with various electron acceptors is feasible (see Table 1 with hexadecane as a model substrate).
Biodegradation of alkanes by speciﬁc groups of microorganisms is
discussed below.
3. Nitrate-reducers
Anaerobic degradation of hydrocarbons under nitrate-reducing
conditions has been regarded as an effective strategy for

bioremediation of crude oil, fuel-contaminated aquifers and
underground storage tanks (Rabus and Widdel 1996). The use of
nitrate for in situ remediation of these contaminated environments
has been driven not only by the favorable energetics of nitrate
reduction but also by high water solubility and mobility of nitrate
(92.1 g/100 ml water at 25  C). Crude oil and its reﬁned products
constitute the major sources of alkanes in the environment
(Ehrenreich et al. 2000). Due to their very low solubility in water,
long-chain alkanes (>C12) are generally not considered as toxic.
However, at high concentrations, relatively short-chain alkanes
(C5eC12) and cyclic alkanes have negative effects on biological
membranes (Gill and Ratledge 1972; Sikkema et al. 1994; Sikkema
et al. 1995). The fate of alkanes and the effectiveness of bioremediation strategies under such conditions require a better knowledge of the biochemical capacities of nitrate-reducing
microorganisms.
Anaerobic oxidation of hydrocarbons coupled to the reduction
of nitrate was ﬁrst demonstrated with pure isolates (strains ToN1,
mXyN1, EbN1, and PbN1) for utilization of alkylbenzenes in crude
oil (Rabus and Widdel 1996). Furthermore, a nitrate-reducing
enrichment culture incubated with crude oil did not show any
degradation of alkanes (C5 to C12) until alkylbenzenes (C1 to C3)
were completely depleted. This indicated that the enrichment
culture exhibited biphasic growth, in which alkanes were only
partially consumed, and among them, n-hexane appeared to be
the preferred substrate. Cell hybridization further revealed that the
majority of the enriched denitriﬁers afﬁliated with the b-subclass of
the Proteobacteria (Rabus et al. 1999).
Ecological distribution of anaerobic hydrocarbons degrading
denitriﬁers is not restricted to hydrocarbon-contaminated habitats
since they have been commonly isolated from non-contaminated
environments (Fries et al. 1994; Song et al. 1999; Zwolinski et al.
2000). The currently known pure isolates of alkane-degrading
nitrate respiring bacteria (NRB) are afﬁliated with the b- and
g-subclass of the Proteobacteria. At least six axenic cultures of
alkane-degrading NRB have been documented so far (Fig. 1 and
Table 2). Strains OcN1 and HxN1were isolated with n-octane and
n-hexane, respectively, from enrichment cultures prepared from
ditch sediments. The two isolates are members of the family Rhodocyclaceae within the b-Proteobacteria (Ehrenreich et al. 2000).
These strains are able to grow for complete oxidation of C6eC12
n-alkanes to CO2 with transitory production of nitrite observed
during the growth of strain HxN1 (Ehrenreich et al. 2000). When
grown anaerobically with crude oil, strain HxN1 has been shown to
co-metabolize short-chain (C4eC5) and cyclic alkanes (cyclopentane and methylcyclo-pentane) in addition to the utilization of
C6 to C8 n-alkanes as substrates (Wilkes et al. 2003). This is of great
interest because n-butane, n-propane and cyclic alkanes as single

substrate could not support the growth of strain HxN1, indicating
that such co-metabolism of structurally diverse substrates is catalyzed by enzymes which are needed for the metabolism of the
growth-supporting substrates, but exert activities on co-substrates
due to “relaxed substrate speciﬁcities” similar to that observed with
anaerobic alkylbenzene-degrading bacteria (Beller and Spormann
1999; Wilkes et al. 2003).
Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence (Fig. 1), strain HxN1 forms
a phylogenetic cluster with alkylbenzenes degrading isolates such
as strains PbN1 and EbN1 (98e99% similarity). This cluster was
originally described as Azoarcus species (Rabus and Widdel 1995;
Rabus and Widdel 1996) on the basis of 16S rRNA gene, but was
recently reclassiﬁed as Aromatoleum species (Wöhlbrand et al.
2007; Grundmann et al. 2008). Strain OcN1, however, is closely
related (97e98% similarity) to pure isolates capable of anaerobic
benzene degradation, e.g., Dechloromonas sp. JJ and RCB (Coates
et al. 2001).
Anaerobic oxidation of long-chain n-alkanes (>C12) coupled to
the reduction of nitrate is apparently restricted to members of the
g-Proteobacteria. Axenic cultures include strain HdN1 from activated sludge (Ehrenreich et al. 2000), Marinobacter sp. BC36 and
BP42 from Berre lagoon microbial mats (Bonin et al. 2004) and the
recently described denitrifying bacterium Pseudomonas balearica
strain BerOc6 from a brakish lagoon (Grossi et al. 2008). These

cultured members of the g-Proteobacteria are able to oxidize
n-alkanes ranging from C14 to C20. Phylogenetic analysis, based on
16S rRNA gene sequences, shows that strain HdN1 forms its own
cluster and probably represent a new lineage within the g-Proteobacteria. Recently, molecular-based microbial community analysis
of a nitrate-reducing enrichment amended with n-hexadecane as
the sole source of carbon and energy revealed the dominant presence of several members of the Proteobacteria. One sequence
retrieved from a DGGE proﬁle was 82% similar to the anaerobic
alkane-degrading nitrate reducer strain HdN1 (Callaghan et al.
2009).
Anaerobic oxidation of branched and cyclic alkanes has also
been demonstrated to occur under nitrate-reducing conditions.
Pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane, C19H40), formerly
regarded as recalcitrant under anaerobic conditions, has been
shown to be biodegraded under nitrate-reducing conditions in
enrichment cultures obtained from a diesel fuel-contaminated
sediments (Bregnard et al. 1997). Within the cycloalkanes family,
cyclohexane has always been the model substrate for biodegradation studies (Trower et al. 1985; Rouvière and Chen 2003), however
all these studies were conducted under aerobic conditions. As
described above, the ﬁrst direct evidence for the anaerobic oxidation of cycloalkanes, e.g., cyclopentane was found in the nitratereducing strain HxN1 grown anaerobically with n-alkanes from

crude oil, the identity of the microorganisms capable of anaerobic
degradation of cycloalkanes under nitrate-reducing conditions is
still unknown. A recent study on anaerobic degradation of
cyclohexane under nitrate-reducing conditions resulted in the
co-enrichment of members of the d-Proteobacteria and Planctomycetales. This enriched culture of freshwater denitrifying bacteria
grown anaerobically with cyclohexane as the sole carbon and
energy source was dominated by 16S rRNA gene sequence related
to Geobacter spp. (∼75% of all cells as detected by phylogenetic
analysis and ﬂuorescent whole-cell hybridization using typespeciﬁc probe), the likely cyclohexane-degrader. Subsequent nitrite
produced during growth of the consortium was not consumed
unless extra ammonium was added to the medium. These observations indicated that the Planctomycetales (anammox bacteria) as
a partner, approximating 18% of all cells, was consuming nitrite via
anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Musat et al. 2010). Such symbiotic
association between hydrocarbon-degraders and anammox
bacteria can be extrapolated from environments such as petroleum
reservoirs where anammox bacteria have also been identiﬁed as
potential contributors to the nitrogen recyclers (Li et al. 2010). It
should be reminded that Geobacter species are often the predominant microorganisms found in hydrocarbon-contaminated environments in which Fe(III)-reduction occur (Zwolinski et al. 2000)
and given that Fe(III)-reduction coupled to alkanes degradation has
not yet been unequivocally demonstrated despite some experimental attempts (So and Young 2001), it is reasonable to assume
that Geobacter spp. related to those identiﬁed by Musat et al. (2010)
may be able to accomplish this task.
4. Sulﬁdogenic microorganisms
The research interest in hydrocarbons utilization by sulﬁdogenic
microorganisms stems from observations of sulﬁde formation
during maturation of oil reservoirs. Indeed, these microorganisms
have always been identiﬁed or isolated from hydrocarbon-rich
environments such as in petroleum deposits, hydrocarbon seeps,
methane hydrates, petroleum-rich hydrothermal sediments,
underground oil storage tanks and hydrocarbon-contaminated
sediments (Magot et al. 2000; Watanabe et al. 2000; Dhillon et al.
2003). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA and functional

genes suggest that sulfate-reducing bacterial (SRB) communities
retrieved from these environments are predominantly afﬁliated
with members of the family Desulfobacteraceae within the d-Proteobacteria. Most members of this family are strict anaerobes that
perform complete oxidation of organic compounds. In contrast to
nitrate reducers, sulfate-reducers that anaerobically oxidize saturated hydrocarbons are likely indigenous to hydrocarbon-rich
environments (Table 3). Eight mesophilic alkane-degrading sulfatereducers have been isolated and reported in the literature. Among
them, cultured members of the Desulfococcus/Desulfatibacillum
cluster including Desulfococcus oleovorans Hxd3 from oil-water
separator (Aeckersberg et al. 1991), strain Pnd3 from petroleumcontaminated marine sediment (Aeckersberg et al. 1998),
Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans AK-01 from petroleum-contaminated estuarine sediments (So and Young 1999b) and Desulfatibacillum aliphaticivorans CV2803T from hydrocarbon-polluted marine
sediments (Cravo-Laureau et al. 2004) are able to grow by oxidizing
n-alkanes ranging from C12 to C20. The n-hexane and n-decane
oxidizing SRB strain PL2 was recently isolated from a p-xylene
degrading sulfate-reducing community. This member of the family
Desulfobacteraceae shared >97% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with the aromatic hydrocarbons degrading strain oXyS1 and
with other members of the Desulfosarcina such as Desulfosarcina
variabilis and Desulfosarcina cetonicum (Higashioka et al. 2009). The
alkane-oxidizing SRB, strain BuS5, isolated from marine hydrocarbon seeps is only able to grow with propane and butane. This
strain clusters within the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus, however no
genus designation has been given so far (Kniemeyer et al. 2007). In
addition, enrichment cultures have been obtained from Gulf of
Mexico sediments grown with butane as the sole substrate at 12  C.
Potentially cold-adapted SRB clone Butane12-GMe, the dominant
bacteria, fell into the Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus cluster and was
most closely related to strain BuS5 (Kniemeyer et al. 2007). More
recently, Desulfobacteraceae-afﬁliated microorganisms capable of
degradation of short-chain n-alkanes appeared to be the predominant members of mesophilic propane and pentane oxidizing
sulfate-reducing enrichments derived from non-marine sediments.
Surprisingly, most of the clones retrieved from these enrichment
cultures shared only 88e95% with strain BuS5, indicating the
existence of a probably large diversity of sulfate-reducing

microorganisms involved in the biodegradation of short-chain nalkanes (Savage et al. 2010).
Field investigations via molecular phylogenetic monitoring of
a sulfate-reducing community incubated in situ for more than 500
days with oil contaminated sediments from 20 m water depth in
a Mediterranean coastal area revealed that many of the most
abundant sequences were closely related (94e98% similarity) to
several alkane-degrading SRB members of the d-Proteobacteria. At
the lower and anoxic sediments layers, alkanes ranging from C17 to
C30 were signiﬁcantly removed. Of all the clones retrieved from the
community, 41e54% fell within the genera Desulfococcus, Desulfonema and Desulfosarcina of the family Desulfobacteraceae (Miralles
et al. 2007).
In addition to the Desulfobacteraceae, two novel sulfate-reducing
strains afﬁliated with the family Syntrophobacteraceae within the
d-Proteobacteria were recently isolated from oilﬁeld production
water and from an oily sludge. The two strains, Desulfoglaeba
alkanexedens ALDCT and Lake, are phylogenetically close to each
other and are able to grow by complete oxidation of C6eC12
n-alkanes (Davidova et al. 2006).
Thermophilic alkane-degrading sulfate-reducers are very rare;
only one isolate has been reported in the literature. Using sediments from Guaymas basin (a site of hydrothermal activities in the
Gulf of California), Rueter et al. (1994) developed an anoxic
enrichment with sulfate reducing activity in the presence of crude
oil at 60  C. Subsequently, axenic culture referred to as Desulfothermus naphthae TD3T was isolated from this enrichment which
was capable of oxidizing n-alkanes. Phylogenetic analysis showed
that the thermophilic sulfate-reducer strain TD3T forms a distinct
cluster within the family Desulfohalobiaceae. The strain is closely
related to another thermophilic sulfate-reducer, Desulfothermus
okinawensis TFISO9T (AB264617), isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal ﬁeld at the Yonaguni Knoll IV (Southern Okinawa Trough)

with 16S rRNA sequence similarity of 96% (Nunoura et al. 2007). To
date, Desulfothermus naphthae TD3T and Desulfothermus okinawensis TFISO9T are the sole representative species of the genus
Desulfothermus. Other genera included in the Desulfohalobiaceae
are Desulfohalobium, Desulfonatronovibrio and Desulfonauticus.
Anaerobic oxidation of alkanes is not restricted to members of
the d-Proteobacteria (Fig. 2). The thermophilic propane-oxidizer
clone Propane60-GuB, retrieved from Guaymas Basin sediment, is
a member of the genus Desulfotomaculum within the Peptococcaceae (Firmicutes) (Kniemeyer et al. 2007). Anaerobic degradation of
branched and cyclic alkanes has been rarely investigated under
sulfate-reducing conditions. The biodegradation of ethylcyclopentane (ECP) by a sulfate-reducing community derived from
an aquifer contaminated by hydrocarbons has nevertheless been
reported (Rios-Hernandez et al. 2003). Molecular analysis of the
community revealed a diverse collection of phylotypes belonging to
genera Syntrophobacter (d-Proteobacteria) and Desulfotomaculum
(Peptococcaceae, Firmicutes) as well as members of the CytophagaFlexibacter-Bacteroides group. The authors speculated that the
sulfate-reducer phylogenetically afﬁliated with the genus Desulfotomaculum would have been responsible for the degradation of ECP
(Rios-Hernandez et al. 2003; Bonin et al. 2004). Other studies have
indirectly indicated the presence of microbial communities
responsible for degrading volatile alicyclic alkanes (constituents of
gasoline and natural gas condensate) under sulfate-reducing
conditions (Townsend et al. 2004).
Another important group of sulﬁdogens is represented by
hyperthermophilic archaeal members of the genus Archaeoglobus
and the order Thermococcales. These strictly anaerobic microorganisms mostly thrive in hydrothermal environments and in
subsurface thermophillic petroleum reservoirs (Stetter et al. 1987;
Beeder et al. 1994; Magot et al. 2000; Miroshnichenko et al.
2001; Gittel et al. 2009). Knowledge about their electron donors

under in situ conditions is scarce. For instance, Archaeoglobusrelated species are not known to utilize alkanes. Nevertheless,
direct evidence shows that Archaeoglobus fulgidus strain VC-16 that
was previously isolated from heated sea ﬂoor at Volcano, Italy
(Stetter et al. 1987) and later from hot oil ﬁeld waters in the North
Sea (Beeder et al. 1994) is able to reduce thiosulfate coupled with
the anaerobic oxidation of n-alkenes (C12:1eC21:1) at 70  C (Kheliﬁ
et al. 2010). To date only some mesophilic sulfate-reducing,
alkane-degrading bacteria have been reported to be able to utilize
alkenes (Cravo-Laureau et al. 2004). However, it has not yet been
completely ruled out that members of the genus Archaeoglobus

would be able to oxidize alkanes. In addition, strain VC-16 can also
metabolize a wide range of fatty acids (C4eC18) with thiosulfate as
the electron acceptor (Kheliﬁ et al. 2010). This latter capability not
only conﬁrms the formerly predicted and controversial b-oxidation
pathway in this strain (Klenk et al. 1997), but also indicate that
Archaeoglobus-related organisms may represent important partners in complex microbial communities.
Hyperthermophilic archaeal of the order Thermococcales are
actually represented by three genera: Paleococcus, Pyrococcus and
Thermococcus (Ribosomal Database Project Release 10; rdp.cme.
msu.edu) (Cole et al. 2009). Physiologically, most members of

S.M. Mbadinga et al. / International Biodeterioration & Biodegradation 65 (2011) 1e13

Thermococcales are organotrophs that gain metabolic energy via
fermentation of complex organic compounds such as peptides or
yeast extract (Bertoldo and Antranikian 2006). They all share
a common physiological feature of reducing elemental sulfur (S0) to
sulﬁde (Magot et al. 2000). It is worth noting that members
belonging to the genus Thermococcus are frequently found more
abundant in samples retrieved from hot oil reservoirs (Orphan et al.
2000; Nazina et al. 2006) and in hydrothermal habitats compared
to the Paleococcus and Pyrococcus species (Lee et al. 2008). Consequently, Thermococcus species are considered to play a signiﬁcant
role in the metabolic activities of complex microbial consortia
occurring within such natural high temperature habitats (Lee et al.
2008). However, no members of the Thermococcus were known to
utilize alkanes until very recently when the growth of Thermococcus sibiricus at 78  C was shown to be stimulated by hexadecane.
Reproducible growth was observed after successive transfers of
T. sibiricus on medium amended with hexadecane as the sole source
of carbon and energy (Mardanov et al. 2009). Elemental sulfur as an
electron acceptor is not absolutely required but stimulates growth.
The strain, which was isolated from a non-water ﬂooded hot oil
reservoir located in Western Siberia (Miroshnichenko et al. 2001),
did not grow in the presence of aromatic hydrocarbons. Sulfate and
thiosulfate are not utilized as alternative electron acceptors.
Moreover, several genes encoding new physiological properties of
T. sibiricus were identiﬁed on the basis of genomic sequence analysis. Open reading frames (ORFs) similar to those identiﬁed in
Thermococcus kodakaraensis were found and described as pyruvateformate lyase (PFL) (see Section 7.1). Since T. kodakaraensis has
never been reported to grow with alkanes, its PFL enzyme was
suggested to play a role in pyruvate metabolism. Due to the lack of
more accurate experimental data on this previously unknown
physiological feature of T. sibiricus, deﬁnitive classiﬁcation as PFL or
alkylsuccinate synthase for the identiﬁed homologous genes could
not be made due to the large divergence observed within glycyl
radical enzymes (GRE) superfamily (Mardanov et al. 2009;
Callaghan et al. 2010). This requires further investigation to elucidate the likely role of this probably new enzyme.
5. Methanogenesis
Methanogenesis is referred to as the biological formation of
methane that is carried out by strictly anaerobic microorganisms.
The anaerobic decomposition of complex organic matter to
methane requires the concerted effort of metabolically different
types of microorganisms. Typically, this mutual dependence is
commonly described as syntrophic cooperation based on the
transfer of formate, hydrogen and acetate from fermentative
organisms to methanogens. The overall biodegradation process
becomes thermodynamically favorable only when the methanogenic substrates generated during the ‘cracking’ of complex organic
matter are promptly used by methanogens in order to keep their
concentrations at a very low level (Schink 1997).
The greatest energy conservation with a given alkane substrate
is obviously to be expected when nitrate, nitrite, chlorate or ferric
iron is used as the ﬁnal electron acceptor. Methanogenic degradation is the least energetically favorable process when compared to
other anaerobic respirations (Table 1).
The biodegradation of alkanes under methanogenic conditions
was ﬁrst demonstrated in highly enriched cultures obtained from
ditch mud with the ability to convert hexadecane into methane and
CO2 (Zengler et al. 1999), so far no isolates had been obtained and
only a few studies have provided the phylogeny of microorganisms
potentially involved in this syntrophic association (Zengler et al.
1999; Gieg et al. 2008; Jones et al. 2008). In the ditch mud methanogenic enrichment degrading hexadecane, it was assumed that

7

the community was essentially composed of: (i) syntrophic protonreducing acetogenic bacteria (Syntrophus spp.) which decompose
the alkane to acetate and H2; (ii) a group of archaea (Methanosaeta)
which form methane and CO2 from acetate; and (iii) another group
of archaea (Metanospirillum and Methanoculleus) converting CO2
and H2 to methane (Zengler et al. 1999). In this enrichment, it was
suggested that more than 2/3 of the methane produced was from
acetate. Similarly, in the methanogenic residual oil degrading
enrichment culture derived from a gas condensate contaminated
subsurface sediments, the archaeal sequences, whose closest
matches were almost exclusively cultivated methanogens, were
predominantly afﬁliated with acetoclastic Methanosaeta spp. The
eubacterial clone library was more diverse, with the majority of
sequences (78.6% clone frequency based on 16S rRNA) related to
Firmicutes (6 phylotypes), including some presumptive Grampositive sulfate-reducing, hydrocarbon-degrading genera related to
Pelotomaculum spp. (Gieg et al. 2008; Abu Laban et al. 2009) as well
as the syntrophic bacteria Desulfotomaculum cluster I (Gieg et al.
2008). Among the other constituents of the eubacterial community were members of the d-Proteobacteria (Desulfobulbus, Desulfovibrio and Smithella), as well as fermentative bacteria afﬁliated
with Chloroﬂexi, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria (Gieg et al. 2008).
Data obtained from the methanogenic enrichment cultures
described above suggest that acetoclastic methanogenesis may
represent an important biochemical pathway for the formation of
methane from crude oil components. This assumption is further
supported by thermodynamic calculations indicating that
hexadecane conversion to methane is driven primarily through
acetoclastic methanogenesis (Dolﬁng et al. 2008).
In contrast, the methanogenic oil alkane-degrading enrichment
derived from estuarine sediments was found to be dominated by
Syntrophus spp. and CO2-reducing methanogens among several
other phylotypes (Jones et al. 2008). Thus, the principal route
whereby oil alkanes are converted to methane was assumed to
involve syntrophic alkane conversion to acetate and hydrogen
linked to syntrophic acetate oxidation to H2 and CO2 and coupled
with methanogenesis from CO2-reductiondthe so called MADCOR
process. This assumption is supported by modeling of isotopic
signatures for CO2 and methane gases collected from heavily
degraded oils of the mesothermic Peace River Oil Sands (Western
Canada) suggesting that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis
(∼75e92%) likely predominates in subsurface degraded oil reservoirs (Jones et al. 2008). Furthermore, the main occurrence of CO2reducing methanogens in oil reservoirs production waters and in
enrichments derived from there also suggest that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis may predominates in petroleum
reservoirs (Magot et al. 2000; Orphan et al. 2000; Grabowski et al.
2005). In addition, there is evidence indicating that in most cases
methanogenesis from acetate in oil reservoirs production waters is
driven primarily through syntrophic acetate oxidation to H2 and
CO2 coupled to methanogenesis from CO2-reduction (Nazina et al.
2006; Mayumi et al. 2010). More recently, the archaeal community composition observed in the thermophilic enrichment derived
from oilﬁeld production ﬂuids with the ability to convert oil alkanes
to methane was only represented by hydrogen-oxidizers afﬁliated
with the family Methanobacteriaceae; while bacterial community
was dominated by fermentative and/or syntrophic organisms
afﬁliating with the orders Thermotogales, Synergistales, Deferribaterales and Firmicutes. These results again support the assumption
of the major role of methanogenic CO2-reduction involved in the
decomposition of oil alkanes in subsurface petroleum reservoirs
(Gieg et al. 2010). Furthermore, since acetoclastic methanogenesis
is likely inhibited upon exposure to 10 % (v/v) of crude oil (the oil
was collected at a site contaminated by crude oil and creosote)
(Warren et al. 2004) and in situations where acetoclastic

8

methanogenesis might be limited/or absent, syntrophic acetate
oxidation coupled to methanogenesis from CO2-reduction is thermodynamically favored, offering the greatest window of opportunity for the successful methanogenic decomposition of oil alkane
(Karakashev et al. 2006; Dolﬁng et al. 2008).
Overall, these ﬁndings indicate that the particular methanogenic route of oil alkane is likely dictated by the sampling source of
the microbial community and when appropriate, thermodynamics
should take into account the contribution of biological factors
(Zwolinski et al. 2000; Dolﬁng et al. 2008). Other studies have
demonstrated that alkanes depletion is coupled to methane
production, indicating the presence of microbial communities
syntrophically converting alkanes to methane (Anderson and
Lovley 2000; Grossi et al. 2000; So and Young 2001; Townsend
et al. 2003; Siddique et al. 2006).
6. Other electrons acceptors
Anaerobic oxidation of organic substrates coupled to sulfate and
nitrate reduction yields relatively less amount of energy, particularly when compared to oxidation with oxygen as the electron
acceptor. It might be possible that other electron acceptors such as
perchlorate and nitrite could be coupled to anaerobic oxidation of
alkanes. Perchlorate and chlorate as well as nitrite are ideal electron
acceptors for microorganisms due to their high redox potentials

and Achenbach 2004; Zedelius et al. 2010). Indeed, Mehboob
et al. (2009) recently reported that Pseudomonas chloritidismutans
AW-1T, isolated from sludge of an anaerobic chlorate-reducing
bioreactor, was able to use n-decane as the sole carbon and
energy source under strictly anaerobic conditions with chlorate as
electron acceptor (Table 2). Perchlorate and chlorate reduction,
which are only induced under anoxic conditions, proceed
according to the equation described in Fig. 3C. Molecular oxygen
generated during the dismutation or disproportionation of chlorite


(ClO
2 / Cl þ O2; DG ¼ 148.4 kJ/mol) is subsequently used to
oxidize the alkane substrate. Hence the degradation of alkanes
under such conditions is assumed to proceed by means of oxygenases under unusual anaerobic process. Here chlorate is not only
the electron acceptor but also the oxygen supplier for oxygenases
activities (Mehboob et al. 2009). Given that high concentrations of
dissolved oxygen are known to inhibit perchlorate and chlorate
reduction (Xu et al. 2004), free oxygen generated as an intermediate must be promptly consumed so that it does not accumulate to
high levels. In addition, P. chloritidismutans AW-1T is able to use
nitrate as an electron acceptor, however in such situation no
growth was observed with n-decane. This shows that oxidation of
alkanes coupled to chlorate reduction is a particular physiological
feature for strain AW-1T.
A much recent way to form molecular oxygen as a metabolite
intermediate is the dismutation of nitric oxide (NO) during nitrite
reduction (NO
2 ) in the methane-utilizing enrichment culture (Ettwig
et al. 2010). Nitric oxide is an intermediate of the well known

microbial nitrate reduction (NO
3 / NO2 / NO / N2O / N2);
however, in the methane-utilizing enrichment culture described by
Ettwig et al. (2010), the sequential reduction of nitrite appear to
proceed otherwise. Experimental evidences indicated that ‘Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera’ (the dominant bacterium in the
methane-utilizing enrichment culture) reduces nitrite (NO
2 ) to nitric
oxide (2NO), after which nitric oxide undergoes a dismutation reaction to yield nitrogen (N2) and molecular oxygen (O2). The oxygen
generated is subsequently used to oxidize the methane substrate to
methanol. This nitrite-linked oxidation of methane resembles, in
principle, anaerobic oxidation of alkane via chlorate reduction.

Therefore, it is possible, even likely that other denitriﬁers’ organisms
with similar physiological features may be able to couple the oxidation of alkanes with various chain lengths to the reduction of nitrite
via nitric oxide dismutation (Ettwig et al. 2010; Zedelius et al. 2010).
7. Biochemical strategies for the anaerobic metabolism of
alkanes
The initial activation of alkanes is critical for their anaerobic
biodegradation. During the past decade numerous studies have
been undertaken to elucidate the activation mechanisms of alkanes
under anoxic conditions. Indeed, anaerobic microorganisms have
developed unprecedented biochemical strategies to overcome the
chemically inert nature of alkanes (Heider 2007). These strategies
involved in the initial attack of alkanes include activation by
addition of fumarate to alkane, carboxylation with inorganic carbon
and other additional possible alternative mechanisms (Fig. 3).
7.1. Alkane activation by addition to fumarate
Increasing evidence indicates that addition to fumarate play
a dominant role in the activation of alkanes for further degradation
under anoxic conditions (Tables 2 and 3). So and Young (1999a) and
So and Young (1999b) provided some evidence linking the growth
of a sulfate reducing isolate D. alkenivorans strain AK-01 to anaerobic oxidation of n-pentadecane and n-hexadecane using labeling
experiments. Metabolites analysis indicated that C-even and C-odd
cellular fatty acids were formed from C-even and C-odd n-alkanes
in strain AK-01. Similar cellular fatty acids pattern has also been
observed in strain Pnd3 (Aeckersberg et al. 1998) and Desulfatibacillum aliphaticivorans CV2803T (Cravo-Laureau et al. 2005). In
addition, strain AK-01 and strain CV2803T also produce 2-, 4-, 6and 8-methyl branched fatty acids as well as (1-methylalkyl)
succinates with chain lengths that speciﬁcally correlated with those
of the parent substrates, thus indicating that n-alkanes are anaerobically activated by addition to fumarate at the sub-terminal
carbon atom (Cravo-Laureau et al. 2005; Callaghan et al. 2006). A
similar reaction has been reported for the nitrate-reducing strain
HxN1 grown on labeled n-hexane with details about the ﬁrst
proposed pathway for anaerobic degradation of a straight-chain
alkane (Rabus et al. 2001; Wilkes et al. 2003; Widdel et al. 2006).
Brieﬂy, addition of fumarate to n-alkane is catalyzed by a radical
enzyme (the extracted hydrogen from the parent substrate is
recovered) to yield (1-methylalkyl)succinate (Fig. 3A), after
which the activation metabolite undergoes a carbon skeleton
rearrangement (presumably as coenzyme A thioester) to form (2methylalkyl)malonyl-CoA that allows decarboxylation to 4-methylalkanoyl-CoA. The resulting fatty acid can then undergo
a “conventional” b-oxidation to yield intermediates such as (2methylalkyl)-CoA, a linear fatty acid containing two carbon atoms
less than the parent n-alkane, propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA.
Acetyl-CoA is further oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2). Fumarate
can be regenerated from propionyl-CoA (via methylmalonyl-CoA
and succinyl-CoA) or alternatively from acetyl-CoA (Rabus et al.
2001; Wilkes et al. 2003; Callaghan et al. 2006; Widdel et al.
2006). The net reaction of alkane addition to fumarate is exergonic (DG0 < 0), thus indicating that there is no needs for exogenous energy (such as ATP hydrolysis) for this reaction to proceed
(Rabus et al. 2001). Similar observations were made with the
formation of benzylsuccinate from toluene and fumarate (Biegert
et al. 1996).
Such a reaction has also been demonstrated for the initial
activation of short chain alkanes (butane and propane) in the
sulfate reducing strain BuS5 and in the enrichment culture
Propane60-GuB derived from marine sediments. On the basis of

metabolites detected in both cultures, butane was speciﬁcally
activated at the sub-terminal carbon atom to yield (1-methylpropyl)succinate and propane was activated at both the subterminal and at one of the terminal carbon atoms to produce
isopropyl- and n-propylsuccinate (Kniemeyer et al. 2007). Based
on current knowledge, the anaerobic activation pattern of propane
occurs in other sulﬁdogenic enrichment cultures (Savage et al.
2010) as well as in hydrocarbons-rich environments (Duncan
et al. 2009; Gieg et al. 2010). Also, cyclic alkanes investigated to
date are exclusively activated through addition to fumarate for
further degradation under anoxic conditions (Rios-Hernandez
et al. 2003; Musat et al. 2010).
The formation of alkyl- or cyclic-branched succinates as catabolic intermediates is, by analogy to the well established formation
of benzylsuccinate as initial activation product of anaerobic toluene
metabolism, catalyzed by strictly anaerobic glycyl radical enzymes
(Widdel et al. 2006; Heider 2007). Therefore, these glycyl radical
enzymes have been termed alkylsuccinate synthase or (1-methylalkyl)succinate synthase (Ass or Mas) for n-alkanes and we suggest
(cycloalkyl)succinate synthase (Cas) for cycloalkanes. This is a novel
class of glycyl radical enzymes afﬁliated to the superfamily pyruvate-formate lyase (PFL) and type III ribonucleotide reductase
(RNR) (Leuthner et al. 1998; Widdel et al. 2006). The genes
encoding the candidate alkylsuccinate synthase (assA or masD)
have recently been identiﬁed in alkane degraders’ sulﬁdogenic
bacteria D. alkenivorans AK-01 (Callaghan et al. 2008) and Desulfoglaeba alkanedexens ALDCT (Callaghan et al. 2010) as well as in
nitrate reducing strains HxN1 (Grundmann et al. 2008) and OcN1
(Zedelius et al. 2010), all afﬁliated to the Proteobacteria (Figs. 1 and
2). Interestingly, assA-like genes were also detected in

methanogenic octacosane (C28H58) degrading enrichment cultures;
which could indicate a possible implication of fumarate in the
initial activation of alkanes under methanogenic conditions
(Callaghan et al. 2010).
7.2. Alkane activation via carboxylation
This second activation strategy was mainly developed from the
growth pattern of the sulﬁdogenic strain Hxd3. On the basis of
metabolite analysis, C-even and C-odd cellular fatty acids were
formed from C-odd and C-even n-alkanes, respectively
(Aeckersberg et al. 1998; So et al. 2003). Growth of Hxd3 with
different chain lengths of non-labeled alkanes in the presence of
H13CO
3 resulted in the formation of fatty acids that are one carbon
atom shorter than the original alkane. Furthermore, their (fatty
acids) carboxyl group contains a 13C atom suggesting that H13CO
3
was directly involved in the initial activation of alkanes in strain
Hxd3. Therefore, strain Hxd3 would metabolize an alkane to fatty
acids via carboxylation with inorganic carbon (HCO
3 /CO2), most
likely at C-3, with subsequent removal of two sub-terminal carbon
atoms from the alkane chain (Fig. 3B). More recently, from an
alkane-degrading, nitrate-reducing consortium, Callaghan et al.
(2009) indicated that a carboxylation-like mechanism analogous
to the activation strategy previously proposed by So et al. (2003)
was the likely route for the anaerobic biodegradation of hexadecane. However, in both cases, the hypothetical fatty acid intermediate (2-ethylalkanoate) which should result from the
incorporation of inorganic carbon at C-3 of the alkane has never
been detected. There is an on-going debate about this initial activation mechanism. From an energetic point of view, the

carboxylation of alkanes is not feasible under standard conditions
(DG0 ¼ þ28 kJ/mol) unless the concentration of the fatty acid
(2-ethylalkanoate) is in the micromolar order of magnitude or less
otherwise this reaction will not proceed under physiological
conditions (Thauer and Shima 2008). The possibility of other
reaction(s) preceding the carboxylation has also been proposed (So
et al. 2003).

genes. The absence of assA-like genes and metabolites that would
have indicate an addition to the double bond of fumarate or even
likely a carboxylation suggest that oil alkanes in the methanogenic
enrichment culture are probably activated via anaerobic hydroxylation (Head et al. 2010).

7.3. Alternative activation mechanisms

Alkanes are quantitatively the most important fraction in crude
oil. The anaerobic biodegradation of alkanes, which has now been
documented to occur in anoxic habitats, is of great importance for
the oil industry. Today, this process remains an exciting area of
investigation to understand the factors that govern the biodegradation of oil in deep-subsurface reservoirs, and for the bioremediation of oil-contaminated environments.
It is now well-established that microbial activities associated
with petroleum reservoirs have led to the decrease of oil quality,
making reﬁning more costly and recovery more difﬁcult (Head et al.
2003). Examination of deep-subsurface petroleum reservoirs has
revealed the presence of live microbial communities dominated by
anaerobes, therefore oil reservoirs have been referred to as “geobioreactors” in which different physiological types of anaerobic
microorganisms including fermentative, syntrophic, sulﬁdogenic
and methanogens may be responsible for the biodegradation of
crude oil in situ with the preferential removal of the saturated
hydrocarbon fraction (Magot et al. 2000; Jones et al. 2008; Wang
et al. 2010).
Petroleum reserves have been depleted to certain levels, and
anaerobic degradation is considered to be one of the major
processes responsible for this phenomenon. Moreover, biogenic
methane that is commonly associated with biodegraded oil reservoirs is believe to be a result of the microbial decomposition of oil
alkanes (Jones et al. 2008). While methanogenic degradation of oil
alkanes has signiﬁcant effect on the recovery of high-value light

Depending on the microorganisms and electron acceptors
available in a selective environment, anaerobic degradation of
alkanes may proceed via alternative activation mechanisms not
involving addition of fumarate or carboxylation. For instance,
Pseudomonas chloritidismutans AW-1T is able to produce its own
oxygen via chlorate respiration for subsequent metabolism of
alkanes (Fig. 3C-1) (Mehboob et al. 2009). This would indicate the
requirement for oxygenases to incorporate molecular oxygen thus
generated from the dismutation of chlorite into the alkane. Such
a reaction is referred to as “unusual oxygenation” of alkane since it
takes place in the total exclusion of air. A similar activation strategy
via “intra-cellular oxygen production” is also possible with electron
acceptors such nitrate or nitrite (Ettwig et al. 2010). However, in
a recent work, it was presumed that nitrite or nitric oxide generated
during the reduction of nitrate may be directly involved as a coreactant for the activation of alkanes in strain HdN1 (Fig. 3C-2)
(Zedelius et al. 2010). Given that the activation metabolite of NO
2 or
NO co-reacting with alkanes is still unknown; this hypothesis
remains to be demonstrated.
Another recently proposed strategy may involve anaerobic
hydroxylation of oil alkanes (Fig. 3C-3). Pyrosequencing of total
genomic DNA retrieved from methanogenic enrichment cultures
degrading crude oil revealed the presence of genes encoding the boxidation pathway and also alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase

crude oil, on the positive side, in situ methanogenic biodegradation
activities may offer a route for potential alternative and innovative
energy recovery strategies from existing oil reservoirs after
extraction. After extensive water ﬂooding, at least two-third of the
crude oil still remains entrapped in pores within the formation, the
recovery of energy from conventional reserves via in situ conversion of even a smaller fraction of the residual oil to methane gas
could represent a considerable supply of energy. This is great
interest because world requirements for methane are estimated to
increase within the next three decades (International Energy
Outlook 2009, 2010; www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/) and methanogenic
conversion of oil alkanes is seen as a future solution for world
energy needs (Fig. 4).
However, there are still many questions regarding the anaerobic
biodegradation of alkanes that need to be addressed. For instance,
though the isolation of anaerobic microorganisms capable of
utilizing alkanes has been essential for a comprehensive understanding of their role and behavior in anoxic habitats, the complex
interactions within methanogenic alkane-degrading communities
are still not well understood. Further research is needed to explore
multidisciplinary, e.g., molecular, microbiological and chemical or
geochemical, approaches to establish the key organisms,
biochemical reactions and mechanisms involved in such complex
associations. For instance, there is now reasonable circumstantial
evidence that some fermentative bacteria such as Firmicutes might
be directly implicated in the degradation of hydrocarbons. It is also
worth noting that microorganisms afﬁliated to Firmicutes are the
most commonly encountered bacterial taxon in samples retrieved
from oil reservoirs (Gray et al. 2010), hence diverse and abundant
members of the Firmicutes should not only be considered as
“traditional” fermentative bacteria, they could have adapted to
metabolize oil components in situ and in methanogenic oil
degrading enrichment cultures.
Sulﬁdogenic prokaryotes, however, are metabolically versatile
and are able to grow either by using sulfate as electron acceptor or
by syntrophic lifestyle in the absence of electron acceptor. This
characteristic makes them important members of degradative
microbial communities. Davidova et al. (2006) reported that
Desulfoglaeba alkanexedens ALDCT is able to syntrophically degrade
alkanes in co-culture with hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Interestingly, several sulfudogenic with the capacity for alkane oxidation are able to utilize thiosulfate, sulﬁte or elemental sulfur as
electron acceptors to enhance their growth yield and rates. This is
of great importance because organic sulfur compounds present in
crude oils can serve as sulfur-based electron acceptors (Röling et al.
2003). The capability of T. sibiricus and related organisms to use
organic substrates such alkanes without needs for exogenous
electron acceptors makes them potential key players of the
complex metabolic food web existing in habitats such as high
temperature petroleum reservoirs (Mardanov et al. 2009). The role
of hyperthermophilic organisms such as Thermococcus sp. and
Archaeglobus sp. in oil reservoirs is not well understood. Analysis of
existing genomic data has started to reveal their potentiality. It is
tempting to speculate that, in high temperature petroleum reservoirs; these archaeal members play a considerable role during the
initial steps of the anaerobic metabolism of alkanes.
Information on the potential of biodegradation can be obtained
from speciﬁc intermediates metabolites where their detection is
indicative of microbial activities on a given substrate. Moreover,
functional genes encoding key enzymes of speciﬁc degradation
pathways can also serve as biomarkers. For instance, studies on
alkylsuccinate genes by means of assA-targetd primer sets have
provided evidence for the importance of novel groups of anaerobic
alkane-degraders and the major role played by glycyl radical
dependent addition to fumarate (Callaghan et al. 2010). However,

11

physiologically distinct microorganisms, e.g., strain Hxd3, utilize
fumarate-independent mechanisms to activate their alkane
substrates. Therefore, additional research at the genomic level will
be necessary to reveal the genetic associated with these new
biochemical pathways.
Finally, understanding the alkanes degrading communities with
their biochemical function will signiﬁcantly advance the knowledge about the organisms mediating the specialized biochemical
reaction steps. This will allow us to better understand the biological
processes responsible for oil biodegradation in natural environments and in petroleum reservoirs for possible biotechnological
innovation and applications in utilization of the residual oils.
