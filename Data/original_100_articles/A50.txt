In Situ Analysis of Denitrifying Toluene- and m-Xylene-Degrading Bacteria in a Diesel Fuel-Contaminated Laboratory Aquifer Column
A diesel fuel-contaminated aquifer was bioremediated in situ by the injection of oxidants (O2 and NO3
2) and
nutrients in order to stimulate microbial activity. After 3.5 years of remediation, an aquifer sample was
excavated and the material was used (i) to isolate bacterial strains able to grow on selected hydrocarbons under
denitrifying conditions and (ii) to construct a laboratory aquifer column in order to simulate the aerobic and
denitrifying remediation processes. Five bacterial strains isolated from the aquifer sample were able to grow
on toluene (strains T2 to T4, T6, and T10), and nine bacterial strains grew on toluene and m-xylene (strains M3
to M7 and M9 to M12). Strains T2 to T4, T6, and T10 were cocci, and strains M3 to M7 and M9 to M12 were rods.
The morphological and physiological differences were also reflected in small sequence variabilities in domain
III of the 23S rRNA and in the 16S rRNA. Comparative sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA of one isolate (T3
and M3) of each group revealed a close phylogenetic relationship for both groups of isolates to organisms of
the genus Azoarcus. Two 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes (Azo644 and Azo1251) targeting the
experimental isolates, bacteria of the Azoarcus tolulyticus group, and Azoarcus evansii were used to investigate
the significance of hydrocarbon-degrading Azoarcus spp. in the laboratory aquifer column. The number of
bacteria in the column determined after DAPI (4*,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining was 5.8 3 108 to 1.1 3
109 cells g of aquifer material21
. About 1% (in the anaerobic zone of the column) to 2% (in the aerobic zone
of the column) of these bacteria were detectable by using a combination of probes Azo644 and Azo1251,
demonstrating that hydrocarbon-degrading Azoarcus spp. are significant members of the indigenous microbiota.
More than 90% of the total number of bacteria were detectable by using probes targeting higher
phylogenetic groups. Approximately 80% of these bacteria belonged to the b subdivision of the class Proteobacteria
(b-Proteobacteria), and 10 to 16% belonged to the g-Proteobacteria. Bacteria of the a-Proteobacteria were
present in high numbers (10%) only in the aerobic zone of the column.
Diesel fuel-contaminated soils and aquifers can be partially
remediated by pumping hydrocarbons occurring in free phase
back to the soil surface or by stripping the subsurface with air
(7). Residual hydrocarbons, however, are often trapped in
cracks and pores of the subsurface, and they may be removed
by in situ bioremediation. This technique is usually based on
the infiltration of water supplemented with oxidants (e.g., O2
and NO3
2) and/or nutrients (e.g., NH4
1 and PO4
32) to stimulate
the catabolic activity of microorganisms in the subsurface
and thereby the biodegradation of the hydrocarbons (18, 23–
25, 32).
An in situ bioremediation process was applied in a diesel
fuel-contaminated aquifer in Menziken, Switzerland (23).
Groundwater supplemented with O2 (329 mM) and NO3
2
(1,020 mM) as electron acceptors and NH4H2PO4 (75 to 125
mM) as the nutrient was infiltrated into the contaminated zone.
At a monitoring well 20 m downstream of the infiltration point,
the oxidants were found to be almost completely depleted (23).
However, under field conditions the hydrocarbon mineralization
and oxidant consumption could be analyzed only with
poor spatial resolution, and the carbon mass, nitrogen, and
electron balances could not be established accurately. Therefore,
after the in situ bioremediation had been carried out for
3.5 years it was decided to excavate some of the contaminated
aquifer material and simulate the processes in laboratory aquifer
columns (20). These columns had lengths of 40.5 cm, and
they were operated under continuous-flow conditions with artificial
groundwater containing O2 (4.4 mg liter21
) and NO3
2
(1,610 mM). After a few days of operation, distinct redox zones
were established. Within 24 cm, the concentration of O2 decreased
from 4.4 mg liter21 to a value below the detection limit
of 0.1 mg liter21
. Denitrification was found to occur over the
entire length of the column, regardless of the presence of O2.
Data on the evolution of dissolved inorganic carbon and the
ratio of n-alkanes to i-alkanes suggested that biodegradation of
hydrocarbons (initial hydrocarbon concentration, 1,100 mg
g21
) occurred over the entire column length (20).
Diesel fuel consists of a large variety of hydrocarbons that
can be degraded under aerobic conditions and partially degraded
under anaerobic conditions (8). As groundwater pollutants,
aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
and xylene are of major concern since they are
highly soluble in water and rather toxic. Diesel fuel contains on
average 1.35 mg of toluene g21 and 1.43 mg of m- plus p-xylene
g21 (30). During the last few years, many pure cultures of
bacteria that are able to degrade toluene under aerobic and
anaerobic—that is, denitrifying (12, 14, 17, 35, 40), iron-reducing
(26), and sulfate-reducing (34)—conditions have been obtained.
However, the significance of these isolates in their
natural habitat, i.e., contaminated soil and aquifer material, is
not known.
The aim of our study was to investigate the significance of
the bacterial isolates in the diesel fuel-contaminated laboratory

aquifer column. These isolates were obtained from the excavated
aquifer material from Menziken and had the capacity to
degrade toluene and/or m-xylene under denitrifying conditions.
The studies included (i) the molecular characterization
of the isolates by comparative sequence analysis of the 16S
rRNA, and (ii) the use of specific rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide
probes to enumerate the isolates by in situ hybridization.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation and growth conditions. Toluene- and m-xylene-degrading isolates
were obtained from denitrifying enrichment cultures inoculated with excavated
material from a diesel fuel-contaminated aquifer (Menziken, Switzerland) (23).
Samples of the aquifer material (10 g) were added to 50 ml of oxygen-free basal
medium (46) supplemented with 1.4 mM Na2SO4, 5 mM KNO3, 1 ml of nonchelated
trace element mixture SL10 (46) liter21
, 1 ml of selenite-tungstate
liter21
, 0.5 ml of vitamin solution (41) liter21
, 15 ml of NaHCO3 solution liter21
,
and either 0.19 mM toluene or 0.16 mM m-xylene at pH 7.2. The cultures were
incubated at 28°C for 10 weeks. Isolates were obtained after aerobic incubation
of serial dilutions of the enrichment cultures on agar plates containing basal
medium supplemented with 0.1% pyruvate and 0.05% KH2PO4. They were
subsequently grown and maintained in liquid culture under denitrifying conditions
with either 0.19 mM toluene or 0.16 mM m-xylene. The cultures were
incubated at 25°C on a rotary shaker (100 rpm). Growth of all isolates on both
substrates was also tested under aerobic conditions.
Molecular characterization of isolates. Cells of well-grown cultures of the
isolates (3 ml) were harvested by centrifugation at 14,000 3 g for 1 min. Cells
were resuspended in 100 ml of distilled water and lysed by the addition of 50 ml
of proteinase K (6 mg ml21
; Appligene, Basel, Switzerland) and 1.5 ml of 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and incubation for 30 min at 37°C. Nucleic acids
were extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, dried, and
resuspended in distilled water (39).
Phylogenetic characterization was based on sequence comparison of approximately
1,450 bp of the 16S rRNA of two isolates, T3 and M3, and of a 240-bp
fragment of the 23S rRNA of all 14 strains obtained. The 16S rRNA was
amplified by PCR with oligonucleotide primer FGPS6 (59GGAGAGTTAGAT
CTTGGCTCAG), containing an internal BglII site (6), and primer 1510 (59GT
GCTGCAGGGTTACCTTGTTACGACT), extended with a PstI site (13). The
23S rRNA fragment was amplified with primers 23InsV (59CACAGATCTMA
DGCGTAGNCGAWGG), extended with a BglII site (37), and 23InsR (59CAC
AAGCTTGTGWCGGTTTNBGGTA), extended with a HindIII site (37). Amplification
by PCR was performed in a total volume of 100 ml containing 10 ml of
103 PCR buffer (500 mM KCl, 25 mM MgCl2, 200 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.4], 0.1%
Triton X-100), 2 ml of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (each at 10 mM in 10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), 0.2 ml of Taq polymerase (5 U ml
21
; Appligene), 3 ml of both
primers (100 ng each), and DNA (approximately 100 ng). Thirty rounds of
temperature cycling (Crocodile II Thermocycler; Appligene) at 95°C, 50°C, and
70°C for 30 s each were followed by a final 7-min incubation at 70°C.
The amplification products were treated with proteinase K (final concentration,
60 ng per 100 ml; Appligene) at 37°C for 15 min (11), extracted with
phenol-chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol (39). Subsequently, the DNA
was cleaved with the restriction enzymes PstI (Appligene) and BglII (Catalys;
Promega, Wallisellen, Switzerland) for 16S rRNA and BglII and HindIII (Promega)
for 23S rRNA fragments and cloned into pGEM-3zf (Promega) by standard
methods (39). The DNA was transformed into E. coli DH5a, and plasmid
preparation was performed by using the alkaline lysis method (39).
Cloned amplification products were sequenced with the Thermo Sequenase
fluorescence-labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Amersham, Zurich, Switzerland)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequences of the isolates
were compared to published 16S rRNA sequences in the EMBL Nucleotide
Sequence Database by FASTA analysis of the GCG sequence analysis package
(17a).
Probes and stains. Oligonucleotide probes targeting rRNA of Bacteria
(Eub338) (3), the a-, b-, and g-Proteobacteria (Alf1b, Bet42a, and Gam42a) (27),
gram-positive bacteria with high G1C DNA contents (HGC69a) (38), and
probes Azo644 (59GCCGTACTCTAGCCGTGC; positions 644 to 661 on the
16S rRNA according to Escherichia coli numbering [9]) and Azo1251 (59CGCG
CTTTGGCAGCCCT; positions 1251 to 1267 on the 16S rRNA according to E.
coli numbering) were synthesized with a primary amino group at the 59 end
(MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). The fluorescent Cy3 Reactive Dye (Amersham)
was covalently bound to the amino group of the oligonucleotide probe,
and the dye-oligonucleotide conjugate (1:1) was purified from unreacted components
and stored at 220°C at concentrations of 25 to 30 ng ml
21 (2).
The DNA intercalating dye 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma,
Buchs, Switzerland) was stored in a 1-mg ml21 solution at 220°C (33). Staining
was performed by the addition of DAPI to the hybridization reaction mixture
(final concentration, 20 ng ml
21
) and was always used as a control stain to detect
all bacteria present in the preparation.
Column operation and analytical procedures. A detailed description of the
column operation and analytic protocols is given in reference 20. After 96 days
of operation the column was disconnected and the aquifer material was frozen
and stored at 220°C until further use.
Cell fixation and pretreatment. For whole-cell hybridization, the frozen aquifer
core was cut into pieces 2.5 or 5 cm in length (see Fig. 3). This material and
cells of pure cultures were fixed in 3 volumes of 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.13 M NaCl, 7 mM Na2HPO4 and 3 mM
NaH2PO4 [pH 7.2] in water) (19) for 3 h at 4°C. Fixed samples were washed with
50% ethanol in PBS and stored in 50% ethanol in PBS at 220°C (15).
Before being applied to slides, 40 ml of the aquifer homogenate was mixed with
960 ml of 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate and the material was dispersed with a
2-mm-diameter ultrasonic treatment probe (Sonifier B-12; Branson, Danbury,
Conn.) at 20% for 1 min. Twenty microliters was subsequently applied to each
well (8 mm in diameter) on gelatin-coated slides [0.1% gelatin, 0.01%
KCr(SO4)2] and allowed to air dry (2). After dehydration in 50, 80, and 96%
ethanol for 3 min each, the preparations were treated with lysozyme (Fluka,
Buchs, Switzerland) (1 mg, corresponding to 37,320 U dissolved in 1 ml of
distilled water) at 37°C for 10 min (16, 22), followed by a final dehydration in 50,
80, and 96% ethanol.
Whole-cell hybridization. Hybridizations were carried out in 8 ml of hybridization
buffer (0.9 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.01% SDS [pH
7.2]) in the presence of 10 to 30% formamide (for Alf1b, 10%; for HGC69a,
Azo644, and Azo1251, 20%; for Eub338, Bet42a, and Gam42a, 30%), 1 ml of the
probe (25 to 30 ng ml
21
), and 1 ml of the DAPI solution (200 ng ml
21
) at 40°C
for 2 h. After hybridization, the slides were washed in buffer containing 20 mM
Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.01% SDS, and either 440, 308, or 102 mM NaCl,
depending on the formamide concentration during hybridization (10, 20, and
30%, respectively), for 15 min at 48°C and subsequently rinsed with distilled
water and air dried.
Samples were mounted with Citifluor (Canterbury, United Kingdom) solution
and examined with a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) Axiophot microscope fitted
for epifluorescence detection with a high-pressure mercury bulb and filter sets 02
(DAPI) and HQ Cy3 (AHF Analysen Technik, Tu¨bingen, Germany) (Cy3).
Microorganisms were counted at a magnification of 31,000 in 20 fields covering
an area of 0.01 mm2 each (15).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Characterization of isolates. Five toluene-degrading isolates
(T2 to T4, T6, and T10) and nine m-xylene-degrading isolates
(M3 to M7 and M9 to M12) were obtained under denitrifying
conditions from the excavated aquifer material from Menziken.
Under denitrifying conditions, isolates M3 to M7 and M9
to M12 grew on both toluene and m-xylene, while isolates T2 to
T4, T6, and T10 were able to grow only on toluene. Under
aerobic conditions, all isolates were able to grow on toluene,
but none of the isolates grew on m-xylene. The toluene-degrading
isolates grew as cocci, while the m-xylene-degrading
isolates grew as rods. The morphological and physiological
differentiation between the two types of isolates was also re-
flected at the rRNA level. Sequence comparisons of domain III
of the 23S rRNA of all isolates revealed identical sequences
within the respective groups, which may indicate multiple isolations
of the same organisms. Between the isolates of each
group, however, similarity values of only 93% were found (Fig.
1). Large differences were also obtained by comparative sequence
analyses of the complete 16S rRNA of representative
isolates (T3 and M3) of each group, for which a similarity value
of only 96.2% was obtained (Table 1).
Comparative 16S rRNA analysis revealed a close phylogenetic
relationship of isolates T3 and M3 to organisms of the
genus Azoarcus (Table 1). The sequences of the 16S rRNA
showed 97 to 98% similarity to sequences of the Azoarcus
tolulyticus group, which had been isolated from a petroleumcontaminated
site and which had the capacity to degrade toluene
under aerobic and denitrifying conditions (10, 17, 47).
One of these organisms, A. tolulyticus Td-15, was also able to
grow on m-xylene under denitrifying conditions. High levels of
similarity to the toluene-, ethylbenzene-, and propylbenzenedegrading
isolates ToN1, EbN1, and PbN1, respectively, which
were phylogenetically classified as members of the b-Proteobacteria
(35), were also obtained. Similarity values of about
98%, however, were also obtained with the 16S rRNA sequences
of Azoarcus evansii KB740, which can use benzoate

and 4-hydroxybenzoate but not toluene as a carbon source
under denitrifying conditions (5). Another Azoarcus species,
Azoarcus indigens VB32 (36), a nitrogen-fixing bacterium living
in close association with Kallar grass (Leptochloa fusca (L.)
Kunth), showed about 95% similarity to isolate T3 and 98%
similarity to isolate M3. Though these results support an assignment
of isolates T3 and M3 to the genus Azoarcus, a more
detailed characterization of both isolates is required in order to
resolve their definite taxonomic position within this genus.
Probe design. Based on the 16S rRNA sequences of isolates
T3 and M3, 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes
(Azo644 and Azo1251, respectively) were designed with a database
containing the 16S rRNA sequences of about 4,000
bacteria and the ARB probe design program (kindly provided
by W. Ludwig, Technische Universita¨t, Munich, Germany).
Probe Azo644 was designed to detect both toluene-degrading
and toluene- and m-xylene-degrading isolates, whereas probe
Azo1251 was designed to differentiate between the isolates. A
search for target sequences for both probes in the EMBL
database showed identical sequences in the 16S rRNA of A.
tolulyticus (strains Tol-4, Td-1, Td-15, Td-17, Td-19, and Td-
21), A. evansii KB740, and Azoarcus sp. strain pF6. A sequence
identical to the target sequence of probe Azo644 was also
detected in the 16S rRNA of b-Proteobacteria strain PbN1,
while the identical target sequence of probe 1251 was found in
the 16S rRNA of b-Proteobacteria strain ToN1. Several strains
showed target sequences with one mismatch to those of the
probes. For A. tolulyticus Td-2 and Td-3, as well as for Azoarcus
denitrificans, this mismatch represented a weak change which
allowed detection of a sequence similar to the target sequences
without a mismatch. In contrast, the mismatches in Azoarcus
sp. strain BH72, Thauera aromatica K172, and b-Proteobacteria
strains EbN1 and mXylN1 represented strong changes allowing
a differentiation between these sequences and the target
sequence under high-stringency hybridization conditions (31).
The applicability of both probes to whole-cell hybridization
and their specificity were demonstrated by whole-cell hybridization
on fixed cells of the isolates, A. tolulyticus Td-15, A.

indigens VB32, and T. aromatica K172, and several reference
organisms which were shown by the ARB program to contain
target sequences similar to those of the isolates (Alcaligenes sp.
[GenBank accession no. L31650], Burkholderia cepacia DSM
50181 [L28675], Comamonas testosteroni DSM 50251 [M11224],
and Nitrosomonas europaea ATCC 25978 [M96399]). Under
highly stringent hybridization conditions with 30% formamide,
isolates T2 to T4, T6, T10, M3 to M7, and M9 to M12, as well as
A. tolulyticus Td-15, were detected by whole-cell hybridization
with Cy3-labeled probe Azo644 (Table 2). Probe Azo1251,
however, hybridized only to isolates M3 to M7, M9 to M12, and
A. tolulyticus Td-15 (Table 2; Fig. 2). Neither the reference
organisms nor A. indigens VB32 or T. aromatica K172 showed
hybridization signals to either of the probes under these conditions.
These results demonstrate the applicability of wholecell
hybridization with probes Azo644 and Azo1251 for the
detection of isolates T2 to T4, T6, T10, M3 to M7, and M9 to
M12. The specificity of the probes for these isolates, however,
is restricted because hybridization results obtained with bacteria
of the A. tolulyticus group as well as A. evansii suggest a
more general specificity for hydrocarbon-degrading Azoarcus
spp.
Characterization of microbial populations in the column.
Whole-cell hybridization with a combination of probes Azo644
and Azo1251 was subsequently used to study the significance of
populations of isolates T2 to T4, T6, T10, M3 to M7, and M9 to
M12, as well as the closely related bacteria of the A. tolulyticus
group and A. evansii, in the laboratory aquifer column simulating
the processes at Menziken. Data on the O2, NO3
2, and
NO2
2 concentrations in this column were reported in detail by
Hess et al. (20). The first 12 cm of the column was aerobic, with
an O2 concentration of .0.1 mg liter21
, while the zone from 24
to 40.5 cm was anaerobic, with an O2 concentration below the
detection limit of 0.1 mg liter21
. The zone between 12 and 24
cm had an O2 concentration of approximately 0.1 mg liter21
and was termed microaerobic. Total bacterial numbers determined
after DAPI staining were highest in the aerobic (1.1 3
109 cells g of aquifer material21 at 1.5 cm of column depth)
and anaerobic (9.1 3 108 cells g of aquifer material21 at 32 cm
of column depth) zones of the column (Fig. 3c). In the aerobic
zone, the large numbers of cells may have been due to favorable
environmental conditions, since O2 and NO3
2 consumption
and hydrocarbon mineralization were high (Fig. 3b). In
the anaerobic zone, the increase in cell numbers could be
correlated to the increase in NO3
2 consumption. In the microaerobic
zone of the column, bacterial numbers were low
(5.8 3 108 cells g of aquifer material21
). This result is also in

agreement with the chemical data, which showed that O2 was
almost depleted and that NO3
2 consumption was low (Fig.
3b).
Whole-cell hybridization with probe Eub338, targeting all
bacteria, revealed that between 86 and 99% of DAPI-stained
bacteria were detected throughout the column (Fig. 3c). The
highest percentage (99%) was obtained in the aerobic zone;
the lowest percentage (86%) was obtained in the anaerobic
zone. The large percentage of cells detectable by whole-cell
hybridization revealed the presence of metabolically active
cells containing sufficient amounts of rRNA for detection and,
at the same time, sufficient permeability for in situ detection
with oligonucleotide probes (4). Comparably high percentages
of cells detected by whole-cell hybridization have been reported
for nutrient-rich environments such as activated sludge,
with up to 89% detection (42–44), or lake snow, with 55 to
100% detection (45). In environments supplying less-eutrophic
conditions, such as drinking water, 70% of surface-associated
and 40% of planktonic cells were detected (28). In the winter
cover and pelagic zones of a high mountain lake, the percentage
of cells detected by whole-cell hybridization was 40 to 81%
(1); in bacterioplankton, it was 35 to 67% (21); and in earthworm
casts, it was up to 37% (15). Therefore, the large percentage
of cells detected in our study by whole-cell hybridization
also suggests that the aquifer column offered favorable
growth conditions.
In this laboratory aquifer column, bacteria of the b-Proteobacteria
were numerically dominant (Fig. 3c), accounting for
between 80 and 87% of the bacteria detected by whole-cell
hybridization in the aerobic zone. These numbers decreased to
42% in the middle of the column and then increased to 66% in
the anaerobic zone (Fig. 3c). The remaining bacteria belonged
mainly to the g-Proteobacteria, with numbers between 10% in
the aerobic zone and 16% in the anaerobic zone of the column,
while bacteria of the a-Proteobacteria were detected in large
amounts (10%) only in the aerobic zone (Fig. 3d). Bacteria
with high G1C DNA contents were detected only in low numbers.
It was reported previously that the microbial communities in
aquatic environments were also dominated by bacteria of the
b-Proteobacteria, e.g., 27 to 42% of the cells in lake snow (45)
or 6.5 to 116% in the winter cover and pelagic zones of a
mountain lake (1). In earthworm casts, numbers of bacteria of
the a- and g-Proteobacteria exceeded numbers of bacteria of
the b-Proteobacteria by far (15).
Our target organisms, i.e., the toluene- and m-xylene-degrading
isolates, bacteria of the A. tolulyticus group, and A.
evansii, were detected throughout the column (Fig. 3d) by
whole-cell hybridization with a combination of probes Azo644
and Azo1251. Their populations were higher in the aerobic
zone of the column close to the inlet (2%) than in the rest of
the column (1%). Compared to genus-specific detection of,
e.g., Acinetobacter, which is present in numbers that constitute
less than 8% of the total bacterial community in activated
sludge with enhanced biological phosphate removal (42, 44),
the detection of hydrocarbon-degrading Azoarcus spp. in numbers
between 1 and 2% suggests that these Azoarcus spp. may
play an important role during bioremediation in diesel fuelcontaminated
aquifer material.
Because of the extreme differences between column and
field conditions, an extrapolation of the population data obtained
in our laboratory aquifer column (scale, 40 cm, with very
limited heterogeneity) to the field (scale, larger than 20 m, with
considerable spatial heterogeneity) is difficult. More information
on the catabolic activity of the hydrocarbon-degrading
Azoarcus population in columns and the field will probably be
obtained when recent advances in studies on the anaerobic
toluene mineralization pathway (11, 29) lead to relevant genetic
information. These sequences, we hope, will allow the
design of probes directed against the mRNA of crucial catabolic
enzymes and hence the determination of the in situ activity
of microbial populations in the subsurface.
