Abstract: Substrate utilization tests with Biolog®plates were used to obtain information on shifts in community
composition and on changes in the metabolic diversity and activity of microorganisms in soil polluted with
hydrocarbons. and/or heavy metals. Differences between the patterns of substrate utilization of endogenous
microorganisms of pristine and contaminated soils were investigated by multivariate analysis. Population changes
and shifts in metabolic diversity were observed both after hydrocarbon pollution or heavy metal contamination.
The overall activity on the 95 Biolog" Gram-negative (GN) substrates correlated well with the respiration rate of
the soil. Soils contaminated with hydrocarbons showed higher metabolic potentials than the corresponding
controls. In contrast, heavy metal pollution caused both lower metabolic activity and a loss in diversity. The
Biolog" assay was found to be suitable to describe changes in functional diversity of soils caused by hydrocarbon
contamination or heavy metal stress.

Introduction
Soil is a highly heterogeneous environment consisting
of abiotic solid, liquid, and gaseous phases together
with various living organisms. Pore space and particle
surfaces provide space for a wide range of microorganisms that play an important role in the mineralization
of organic matter and the recycling of elements. In
addition, a large number of contaminants found in soil
are degraded and detoxified by microorganisms. Despite an increasing number of analytical techniques,
diversity and physiological variability of terrestrial
microbial communities are still underexplored. Only a
small part of the species found in soil communities can
be characterized by cultivation.
Recently, biochemical and molecular biological
methods have opened up new possibilities to obtain
information on composition, and temporal and spatial
changes in bacterial communities. Patterns of commu-

nity-level, single-carbon-source utilization have been
used to compare microbial communities from different
habitats (Garland and Mills, 1991; Haack et aI., 1995;
Winding, 1994; Wiinsche et aI., 1995; Zak et al., 1994)
to monitor the impact of pesticide treatment (Engelen
et aI., 1998), of heavy metals (Knight et al., 1997), or
of flooding (Bossio and Scow, 1995) on the microbial
community.
The Biolog'" system is based on the reduction of a
tetrazolium dye as a measurement of electron transport
activity and the ability to oxidize 95 different carbon
sources. It was originally designed for the identification and classification of pure cultures of heterotrophic
bacteria (Bochner, 1989a, 1989b; Bochner and
Savageau, 1977). Later, Garland and Mills (1991) extended the method to classify microbial communities
of different environmental samples and to characterize
their functional potential. With these 95 different carbon sources, microbial communities produce a repro-

ducible and site-specific activity pattern. Multivariate
analysis of these patterns is then used to search for
relationships between samples from the different habitats. This assay, also called physiological profiling,
seems to be suitable for investigations of microbial
communities across spatial, temporal, or experimental
gradients.
The disposal or accidental release of organic and
inorganic compounds into the environment has resulted in a worldwide pollution of soil, groundwater,
and aquatic ecosystems, a main pollutant being hydrocarbons. Biodegradation of hydrocarbons by natural
populations of microorganisms is well known. Many
microorganisms are able to utilize these compounds as
a source of energy and carbon (Bossert and Bartha,
1984; Cerniglia et al., 1992; Song et al., 1986).
The massive pollution of the environment by hydrocarbons initiated the development of various technologies to treat contaminated soils, including physical, chemical, and biological remediation methods
(Skladany and Metting, Jr., 1993). Bioremediation is
often preferred, because the contaminants can be transformed to nonhazardous compounds at low costs, particularly by using in situ or on-site bioremediation
techniques. The metabolic abilities of the microorganisms determine the rate and degree of mineralization of
hydrocarbons, thus interest in quantifying impacts on
the biotic component of the soil ecosystem increases.
Traditionally, contaminated sites have been investigated using microbiological techniques like estimations of total cell counts, viable cell counts on different
media, or quantitation of physiologically specialized
groups (Alef, 1994; Alef and Nannipieri, 1995; Kampfer
et al., 1991) and the determination of the microbial
respiration activity of soil (Klein, 1992; Miethe et al.,
1994). Substrate utilization patterns allow a rapid assessment of the dynamics of microbial soil communities during bioremediation as well as an estimation of
their biodegradative potential.
This article describes the changes in substrate utilization of the microbial community during the

remediation of hydrocarbons and the effect of heavy
metals in static and constantly agitated soil.

Materials and Methods
Soil Preparation
Samples of pristine soil originated from the Botanical
Garden of Zurich and were taken from the top layer
of the A-horizon. The highly contaminated soil
came from a hydrocarbon-polluted site near Geneva,
Switzerland, and was obtained from the EBIOX
Remediation Company. All soil samples were homogenized and sieved and fractions <2 mm were used for
the experiments. For artificial contamination of control soil, soil material was mixed with defined amounts
of hydrocarbons or heavy metals (Table 1). These
substances were sprayed on the soil using a trigger
spray bottle, while the soil was mechanically mixed.
Phenanthrene was pulverized in a mortar and added as
a fine powder (2 g/kg). Original, pristine soil was used
as a reference to assess natural changes in community
composition during incubation.
Soil pH was measured in 1 M KCl solution. Dry
weight (dwt) was measured after drying at 105°C for
24 h. Water content (wet) and maximum water-holding capacity (WHC max) were determined by percolation with water after standing for an hour according to
published methods (Alef, 1994; Alef and Nannipieri,
1995).
In static incubation systems, soil samples of 1 kg
were incubated in polycarbonatejars in the greenhouse
at a mean temperature of 26°C and a humidity of 70%
to prevent drying. The water content of the soil was
kept constant at 25 to 30% (40 to 48% of maximum
water-holding capacity) during incubation. Samples
were taken at the beginning, 11 to 18 days, and 5 to 7
months after the addition of the pollutants, depending
on the experiment (exact duration is given in the legends to figures and tables). The microorganisms were
then extracted from the soil and the extract was used to
inoculate the microtiter plates.

Dobler, Saner, and Bachofen

To simulate an active bioremediation process, the
polycarbonate jars were equipped with a gassing system. Compressed air was released from the bottom
into the soil at a rate of 2.5 L/min. The reaction vessels
were kept at 22°C and the air was humidified by passage through a washing bottle containing sterile water.
Experiments under constantly agitated and aerated conditions were performed in a specially designed
100-L bioreactor (Saner et aI., 1996a) using 22 kg of
fresh soil. In this system, the soil is slowly agitated and
kept homogeneous at its original water content (24%)
by a planetoid mixing system. The activity of aerobic
soil organisms is measured as CO 2 production and O2
uptake in the efflux by on-line mass spectrometry
(PGA100, Leybold, Koln, Germany). Additionally, the
soil temperature is a good indicator of general biological activity of the soil. Before the addition of the
substrate hydrocarbons, the soil was mixed and aerated for 24 h. To minimize nutrition limitations in the
soil, a basal medium made in distilled water was used
(3.3 giL Na zHP0 4 , 1.6 giL KH zP0 4 , 0.1 giL
MgS0 407HzO, 0.02 gIL CaClzoHzO, 1.0 gIL NH4CI).
This basal medium was supplemented by a vitamin
and trace element solution (Pfennig and Lippert, 1966).

Microbial Populations
Microorganisms were extracted from the soil following the directions of Klein (1992). Ten-gram samples
of fresh, sieved soil were suspended in 100 mL sterile
0.2% tetrasodium pyrophosphate solution and shaken
in 250 mL flasks for 30 minutes (150 rpm) at room
temperature. After sedimentation at 1 g for about 5
minutes, the supernatant was taken to represent the
entire bacterial community. The diluted suspensions
(sterile 0.9% NaCI-solution) were used directly to inoculate Gram-negative (ON) Biolog" plates and to
determine the cell number. For actinomycetes and fungi,
the suspension was diluted in a gel-forming colloid
(0.2% Carageenan Type II) instead of 0.9 % NaCI.
This enhances growth and keeps the cells uniformly
suspended in the wells (BIOLOG, 1993, 1994).
The number of viable cells was determined by
standard plate count as colony-forming units (cfu) with
serial dilutions and three replicates of each on R2A
medium (Reasoner and Geldreich, 1985). Incubation
was at room temperature, and the colonies were counted
after 10 days.
Substrate utilization patterns of soil microbial
communities were obtained with Biolog" GN
microplate test panels with three replicate suspensions
from each sample. Soil suspensions were diluted 100fold with 0.9% saline to minimize background absorbance; 125 JlL were used for the inoculation of the

wells. The plates were incubated at room temperature
and the absorbance (590 nm) of the 96 wells was
recorded over 120 h (Reader 2001, Anthos Labtec
Instruments G.m.b.H., Salzburg, Austria). An incubation time of 72 h proved to be optimal for the soil
samples.
Sporulating and filamentous (SF) microorganisms
were tested on Biolog" SF-N microplates using the
same inoculum as before. One hundred microliters
each of chloramphenicol (10 mg/L), streptomycin sulfate (10 mg/L), and benzylpenicillin (20 mg/L) were
added to suppress bacterial growth in the soil suspension. The plates were incubated at room temperature
for several days. For .actinomycetes and fungi, the
incubation period was extended to 216 h. The 120-h
readings were taken to best represent the community
of sporulating and filamentous microbes. The SF-N
microplates are identical to the GN microplates except
the substrate wells lack the tetrazolium redox dye.
Optical density (OD) readings were made at 590 nrn
and indicated turbidity and thus growth. After inoculation, the SF-N microplates were incubated and the
absorption of each well was read after 24 to 120 hand
the data analyzed using Microsoft Excel".
The color intensity of Biolog" GN microtiterplates
is expressed as average well color development
(AWCD) and calculated as the mean of the 95 absorbance values corrected for the control background. In
SF-N plates lacking the electron acceptor dye, average
well turbidity (AWT = OD 590) was calculated similarly to express the overall growth in the 95 wells.

Chemical Analyses
Hydrocarbons were extracted from soil with an equal
amount of ethylacetate, the slurry treated with ultrasound, shaken, and centrifuged (Eschenbach et aI.,
1994; Saner et al., 1996a). Extracts were analyzed by
gas chromatography (DANI gas chromatograph [GC]
86.10 HT, with flame ionization detector [FID] 86/10
or the Gas Chromatograph Detector (GCD)-System
Hewlett Packard [HP] G1800A) on Altech Econo-Cap
capillary columns using 1 ~L of extract (injector temperature 250°C; carrier gas 1.0 mL/min helium; FID
275°C, split 1:50; temperature program: 1 min hold at
35°C, 35 to 200°C at 10°C/min ramp, 200 to 250°C at
5°C/min ramp). Diesel oil was quantified by adding up
the peak areas in the retention time interval from 3 to
14.5 min.

Statistical Treatment of Data
To compare samples with substantial variation in
AweD (or AWT), the data were normalized by
dividing the values for individual wells by the AWCD

43

(or AWT) for the sample (Garland, 1996a). In addition, the AWCD/AWT ratio for specific categories
of carbon sources was computed using the classification of Garland and Mills (1991) with 11 categories. This allowed for comparison of the activity on
polymers, carbohydrates, and carboxylic and amino
acids between soil samples. The number of substrates used by a microbial community is called
substrate richness (S) and was defined as the number of background-corrected absorbance values
greater than 0.5 absorbance units after 72-h incubation on GN microplates or after 120h on SF-N
microplates. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of
the background-corrected absorbance values at 590
nm were calculated between single samples and the
standard deviation (StD) among replicates was computed.
Data used in community ecology are often multivariate. The relationships between the patterns of
color formation also require multivariate statistical
analysis to reduce. the multidimensional data into a
more readily interpretable form. Characterization is
done on the basis of a number of variables, here the
respiratory activities of the microbial communities
on the 95 different substrates. Comparisons must be
made between plate readings of equivalent incubation times. The multivariate method of ordination
was used to concentrate the data and to find causal
or descriptive relations among samples (Gauch,
1982). From the numerous ordination techniques,
principal components analysis (PCA) has been chosen using background-corrected absorbance values.
PCA is an operation that projects the multivariate
data onto a reduced number of dimensions (principal components) that capture a subset of the total
variance in the data set (Pileou, 1984). With the
software DataMost (1994), best results were achieved
by selecting a variances-covariances matrix. The
data are summarized, but still display the original
pattern. For interpretation, the samples were plotted
using the component values as graphical coordinates.

Results
Population Changes during a 5-Month
Incubation of Soil with Hydrocarbons
in a Static System
Changes in community composition were followed in
a natural soil system that had been artificially contaminated with diesel oil or with phenanthrene. Diesel oil
was used as a model compound for general environmental pollution by hydrocarbons, and phenanthrene

44

represents a complex aromatic substance known to be
degraded by soil microorganisms (Fuenmayor and
Rodriguez Lemoine, 1992; Stringfellow and Aitken,
1994).
A 5-month incubation of pristine and highly polluted soil, parallel to experimentally contaminated soil
(1 % diesel or 0.2% phenanthrene) was carried out
under static aerobic conditions and analyzed after 11
and 166 days. During the first 11 days, only slight
changes in the composition of the endogenous microbial communities were observed. PCA (Figure 1)
showed high similarities between the different samples,
They were only separated by the first principal component (PC) (accounting for 80% of the variation in the
data). The second PC, which accounted for 7% of
variation, did not differ significantly. The small differences in metabolic potential between the artificially
contaminated soil and the control were also reflected
in high correlation coefficients (difference between
uncontaminated soil after 11 days [US 11 d]) and
phenanthrene-contaminated soil after 11 days [Ph 11
d]: r = 0.852; between uncontaminated soil [US 11 d]
and diesel-contaminated soil after 11 days [D 11 d]: r
= 0.835). During this short incubation time, the number of metabolized carbon sources decreased slightly
in all experiments (Table 2). The community extracted
from the reference sample showed a loss in substrate
richness of five Biolog" substrates, while in the artificially phenanthrene-contaminated soil five substrates
were no longer used and two substrates were new, and
in diesel oil-contaminated soil three were no longer
used and four become newly utilizable.
The relationships between the substrate utilization
patterns recorded after 166 days of incubation were
illustrated by the plot of principal components (Figure
1). This graph indicated that considerable changes
occurred in the metabolic patterns of the different soil
samples over this much longer incubation time. The
patterns became clearly separated by the first two principal components. The scatters of replicates, as indicated by error bars, did not overlap between the samples.
Seventy-two percent of total variance in the data were
explained by the first and 11% by the second PC axis.
Considerable shifts took place within the number of
metabolized substrates (Table 2). Furthermore, the
overall activity on the 95 Biolog" substrates decreased
generally during the second part of the incubation
(Figure 2), as did the substrate richness. The decrease
in AWCD after 166 days was mainly due to a loss of
activity on polymer and carbohydrate substrates (Figure 3).
The small change during the first 11 days discussed above suggests that the microbial population

related to differences in the response in samples with
different coordinate values for that PC (Garland and
Mills, 1991). Samples with higher coordinate values
for PC 1 show a greater response for carbon sources
positively correlated to PC 1 when compared with
samples with low PC 1 scores. Poor correlation of a
carbon source to a PC does not mean that it was poorly
utilized by the samples, but rather that its utilization
was not different among samples with higher and lower
coordinate values for that PC. Analysis of PCI indicates that soil microbial communities with low scores
on this component (Figure 1) utilized the substrates
listed in Table 3 to a relatively lesser degree. Apart
from uridine, carbon sources positively correlated to
PCI were mostly polymers and carbohydrates (correlation coefficients of AWCD to PC 1 of the polymers:
r = 0.909; and carbohydrates: r = 0.773). Microbial
communities associated with high scores on the second component in PC analysis show a greater relative
utilization of the positively-correlated substrates
(o-mannose, t.-arabinose, t-rhamnose, n-sorbitol, and
itaconic acid) and a smaller utilization of negatively
correlated substrates (bromo-succinic acid, n-saccharic acid, n-glucuronic acid, and citric acid). The high
number of carbohydrates positively correlated to PC2
leads also to a high correlation coefficient of these
carbon sources (r :::: 0.940). The contaminated soil
from a remediation site was clearly different from its
composition at time zero and at the end the experiment.

Incubation of Soil with Heavy Metals
in a Static System
Pristine soil was experimentally amended with the
heavy metals cadmium, mercury, copper, and arsenic
to concentrations of 1000 ppm, and microbial carbon
source utilization was analyzed after 18 and 217 days.
Samples from the various treatments had different
patterns of carbon source utilization. The plot of the
first and second PC illustrated that arsenic and copper
stress induced a strong impact on the microbial community in only 18 days of incubation, while mercury
and cadmium had only minor effects within this time
scale (Figure 4). Seventy-eight percent of total variance accounted for the first PC. The second PC, which
explained 7% of the variance, clearly distinguished the
arsenic- and copper-treated samples from others that
were still closely related and formed a cluster together
with the control. The samples contaminated with the
different heavy metals were characterized by the lowered activity of the arsenic and copper samples in

extracted from the arsenic-contaminated soil had
changes in utilization in 20 substrates: 14 were no
longer used while six were new. After the addition of
copper, 13 substrates were no longer used. The corresponding control values were -7 and + 1. Interestingly,
AWCD as a measure of respiratory activity showed
only small differences on the 95 Biolog" substrates
after heavy metal contamination when compared with
the control.
After 217 days, the results were quite different.
The substrate richness and the AWCD both decreased
to low levels in all the contaminated samples as well as
in the control. With As, Cd, Cu, and Hg, 71, 71, 72,
and 63 substrates, respectively, were no longer used.
Only with Hg were nine substrates newly utilizable.
The corresponding control showed a loss of ability to
metabolize 49 substrates and an addition of 23 new
substrates. In the cadmium- and copper-treated samples,

the AWCD reached mean values of less than 0.05
absorbance units and produced the largest distance to
the control sample (US initial, Figure 5). The decrease
in substrate richness and metabolic activity of the pristine control sample was probably due to exhaustion of
nutrients after the long incubation time (Figure 6).

It is well known that mineralization of hydrocarbons is

aeration system used in these experiments simulates in

not volatilization was responsible for most of the loss.
A minor initial loss in diesel oil was caused by evaporation of the highly volatile components. The addition
of copper negatively affected the degradation of diesel
oil components.
Carbon source utilization profiles were analyzed
after three weeks (Figure 7). In PCA of the carbon
source utilization, the first covariance PC axis accounted for 78%, and the second axis accounted for
7% of the variation in the data. PC axis 1 had the
highest correlations to the substrates i.-aspartic acid,
glucose-6-phosphate, glucose-I-phosphate, and su-

senic (0.1 % of dwt each) and the hydrocarbons quantified during a 3-week incubation. The phenanthrene
content dropped to 10% of the starting value in the
static system due to microbial activity (Figure 6).
Aeration did not stimulate the degradation rate, indicating that a factor other than the diffusion of oxygen
was rate limiting. As expected, the addition of copper
or arsenic resulted in a significant inhibition of phenanthrene degradation. In diesel oil-contaminated soil, the
amount of total hydrocarbons decreased to 40% of the
original value, independent of the use of the aeration
system, indicating that hydrocarbon degradation and

erose. These were the substrates for which consistent
differences were observed in the degree of substrate
utilization between the communities. The second PC
axis was highly correlated to the oxidation of inosine,
D-galactonic acid lactone, D-galactose, cellobiose, glucose-l-phosphate, r-arabinose, maltose, and gentiobiose. Although the degradation rate for diesel was
similar, parallel samples (one aerated and the other
not) differed significantly in community analysis.
Thus, forced aeration changed the soil community
composition much more than the rate of diesel degradation.
The largest shifts in the substrate utilization pattern were observed in samples contaminated with heavy
metals. These samples also showed the lowest substrate richness and overall activity. Cu and As addition
resulted in a loss of ability to degrade 20 to 25 substrates and hardly a gain of new ones. Again, the
ability to degrade polymers and carbohydrates was
mainly altered by the presence of copper or arsenic.
The number of colony-forming units indicated that
heavy metal-adapted microbial populations were still
highly capable of growing on a complex medium such
as R2A. The colonies were smaller, but their number
had increased strongly in the presence of diesel or

phenanthrene irrespective of whether Cu or As were
added. This showed that within 3 weeks additional
carbon sources led to excess growth of heavy metaltolerant microorganisms that can be cultivated on R2A
medium. Particularly diesel oil, which contains a variety of hydrocarbons, led to an increased number of
cultivable cells.

Population Changes during a 1-Week
Incubation of Soil with Hydrocarbons
in an Agitated Aerated Soil Bioreactor
In contrast to the previous experiments with a static
system with soil in pots, these experiments were conducted in a sophisticated soil reactor developed for
testing soil prior to large-scale bioremediation projects
(Saner et al., 1996a, 1996b). Figure 8 shows the time
course with CO 2 liberation and temperature, which is
also a good measure of biological activity. After substrate addition (dodecane [2 gIL], naphthalene [0.5 gIL],
and anthracene [0.5 gIL]), an initial peak in CO 2
emerged from the soil, but within a few hours CO 2
production ceased. CO 2 evolution recovered after adding the basal mineral medium containing trace elements and vitamins. The day-night fluctuation of the
soil temperature indicates changes in ambient tem-

perature in the laboratory. The addition of the mineral
medium initiated a temperature increase due to higher
biological activity after nutrient supply.
Substrate utilization patterns with ON and SF-N
plates were obtained after 1, 3, and 5 days of operation
and compared with the initial conditions. The overall
activity (AWCD) on the ON plates correlated well
with respiration activity found during the remediation
process. Ordination produced from PCA of microbial
communities indicated a temporal trend toward lower
values on the first and second PC (Figure 9). Evaluation of the variables that highly correlated with the first
axis showed an increase in utilization of ~-hydroxybu­
tyric acid, quinic acid, and L-aspartic acid during the
remediation time. Correlation to the second axis indicated a decrease in utilization of D-melibiose as carbon
source.
The PCA of patterns derived from SF-N plates,
indicative of the metabolic activity of sporulating and
filamentous microorganisms, resulted in a different
ordination plot (Figure 10). Only the sample taken
after 5 days was separated from previous ones. Fungi
on SF-N plates showed a much slower response to the
hydrocarbon mixture than bacteria on ON plates. This
suggested that under these conditions the effect of
slower-growing microorganisms was observed. The
clear separation on day 5 was caused by an increase in

Discussion
Cell number and species diversity of microorganisms
are strongly determined by the regime of the dominating environmental factors. Without doubt, pollutants
entering an ecosystem will have a strong influence on
biodiversity, inducing both a loss in prevailing physiological activities and a gain of new ones. Thus, it is
of great interest to follow the changes in microbial
diversity during the remediation process.
The results presented illustrate that the analysis of
the substrate utilization pattern as exemplified by the
Biolog" system is a rapid and simple approach to
assess the potential functional biodiversity of soil microorganisms without the tedious isolation and identification of single community members. Samples are
differentiated in time series or show community changes
due to different treatments. Different temporal trends
become apparent in the communities. PCA separates

Population Changes of Soil Microbial Communities

soil samples typically on the basis of responses that are
high in one community and correspondingly low in
other ones. The correlation of the carbon sources tested
with the principal components can be used to evaluate
the functional basis for differences among the samples.
Additionally, patterns of overall substrate use (AWCD)
can be viewed separately from the utilization of particular categories of substrates. This provides information at different levels of functional resolution.
Like other culture-based procedures, the method
is selective. It only detects activities from bacteria
capable of growing on the substrates and the nutrient
medium provided by Biolog". Oligotrophic microorganisms and obligate anaerobic bacteria do not respond. Furthermore, the Biolog" community assay reflects a functional potential rather than an in situ activity
(Garland and Mills, 1991). Haack et al. (1995) showed
that Biolog" carbon source utilization profiles of whole
microbial communities are reproducible and unique
for different communities, but they are not simply the
sum of those activities exhibited by community members when tested separately. Thus, differences in substrate utilization profiles for replicate soil samples indicate real differences in community composition,
mainly due to microscale heterogeneity in the soil.
Comparing the microorganisms that grow in each
Biolog" well to the total community that is present in
the sample might help to increase the value of substrate utilization patterns for biodiversity analysis.
Molecular methods based on DNA or 16S rRNA can
provide an estimate of the fraction of community
members that respond to the Biolog" assay conditions.
Analyses of dominant nucleic acid fragments in the
Biolog" wells by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis have been shown to give evidence for a reduction in diversity and selective enrichment of a few
strains in the presence of the Biolog" substrates (Smalla
et aI., 1998).
Several statistical approaches allow the evaluation of multivariate data, such as Biolog" substrate
utilization patterns. Here, PCA has been chosen to
illustrate the relationships between samples concerning their catabolic potential. PCA ordination technique
separates different samples along the first and second
PC, which typically account for more than 80% of the
variation in the data set. The major relationships among
samples are visualized by examining the relative similarity of the principal component scores of their carbon
source utilization patterns. Differences among samples
are analyzed by evaluating the correlation of the original variables to the principal components. Other forms
of ordination are canonical correspondence analysis
(Bossio and Scow, 1995; Grayston et aI., 1994) or

53

detrended correspondence analysis (Garland, 1996a;
Garland, 1996b), of which all have been applied successfully to establish distinctions among community
substrate utilization profiles.
Replicate soil samples, mean scores, and standard
deviation among the replicates for the first and second
PC help to evaluate whether the Biolog'" assay will
distinguish between different samples. The length of
error bars reflects mainly microscale spatial heterogeneity in the soil. Short incubation times after the stress
application, for example, the addition of a pollutant, do
not sufficiently resolve in the patterns of substrate
utilization. However, over longer incubation times, the
Biolog" assay allows one to follow changes in soil
microbial communities.
The microbial communities analyzed were all
highly active in the presence of hydrocarbon contamination, confirming that the ability to utilize these compounds is widespread among microorganisms, even
from environments where no hydrocarbon pollution is
expected. Hydrocarbon-contaminated samples generally show higher metabolic potentials, when compared
with uncontaminated samples, after the same incubation time, suggesting that microbial communities in
soil are mainly limited by the available carbon. Often
a high initial activity in soil samples is observed, probably due to the soil preparation, as homogenization
and sieving enlarge the surface area and facilitate oxygen availability Therefore, the activity and substrate
richness at the beginning of the experiments is probably overestimated.
Heavy metals, especially copper and arsenic, had
a drastic inhibitory effect on average activity as well as
on the richness of the microorganisms according to the
Biolog" analysis. Plating on rich medium, however,
indicated that the cell number growing under these
conditions increased. Thus, a stress-resistant population of low diversity had multiplied faster than the
population in the control soil.
Although aeration in a static system had no effect
on the degradation rate of diesel or phenanthrene, the
microbial population extracted from these soils differed greatly. Active aeration compared with oxygen
supply by simple diffusion changed oxygen gradients
and increased oxic sites. Thus, the degradation of hydrocarbons must have been limited by factors other
than oxygen.
Agitation combined with aeration greatly increases
oxygen mass transfer within the soil (Saner et al.,
1996a, 1996b). This suggests that oxygen was not the
limiting factor for hydrocarbon degradation in this
system. The addition of the basic inorganic nutrients
supplied with trace elements and vitamins stimulated

the metabolism as indicated by CO2 liberation and
temperature increase. The fast-reacting organisms (GNplates) resulted in population changes by the second
day, while slow-growing organisms hardly separated
on PC analysis until day 5.
Several approaches may help to draw more information from substrate utilization patterns between
microbial communities:
1. Use of additional specific carbon sources on
Biolog MT microplates lacking the carbon
source. Functional shifts might be more readily
detected in contaminated samples if alternative carbon sources are selected (e.g. the contaminants or substrates that are known not to
be generally utilized) (Insam, 1997).
2. Continuous recording of the kinetics of the
color formation instead of end-point measurements. Such profiles could further characterize the community change over time and increase the analytical power of the method.
3. Strict control of the inoculation size, because
this influences the kinetics of color development (Garland et al., 1997; Winding and
Hendriksen, 1997), that is, by basing inoculation on equal DNA or protein in a sample.

Abstract: Substrate utilization tests with Biolog®plates were used to obtain information on shifts in community
composition and on changes in the metabolic diversity and activity of microorganisms in soil polluted with
hydrocarbons. and/or heavy metals. Differences between the patterns of substrate utilization of endogenous
microorganisms of pristine and contaminated soils were investigated by multivariate analysis. Population changes
and shifts in metabolic diversity were observed both after hydrocarbon pollution or heavy metal contamination.
The overall activity on the 95 Biolog" Gram-negative (GN) substrates correlated well with the respiration rate of
the soil. Soils contaminated with hydrocarbons showed higher metabolic potentials than the corresponding
controls. In contrast, heavy metal pollution caused both lower metabolic activity and a loss in diversity. The
Biolog" assay was found to be suitable to describe changes in functional diversity of soils caused by hydrocarbon
contamination or heavy metal stress.

Introduction
Soil is a highly heterogeneous environment consisting
of abiotic solid, liquid, and gaseous phases together
with various living organisms. Pore space and particle
surfaces provide space for a wide range of microorganisms that play an important role in the mineralization
of organic matter and the recycling of elements. In
addition, a large number of contaminants found in soil
are degraded and detoxified by microorganisms. Despite an increasing number of analytical techniques,
diversity and physiological variability of terrestrial
microbial communities are still underexplored. Only a
small part of the species found in soil communities can
be characterized by cultivation.
Recently, biochemical and molecular biological
methods have opened up new possibilities to obtain
information on composition, and temporal and spatial
changes in bacterial communities. Patterns of commu-

nity-level, single-carbon-source utilization have been
used to compare microbial communities from different
habitats (Garland and Mills, 1991; Haack et aI., 1995;
Winding, 1994; Wiinsche et aI., 1995; Zak et al., 1994)
to monitor the impact of pesticide treatment (Engelen
et aI., 1998), of heavy metals (Knight et al., 1997), or
of flooding (Bossio and Scow, 1995) on the microbial
community.
The Biolog'" system is based on the reduction of a
tetrazolium dye as a measurement of electron transport
activity and the ability to oxidize 95 different carbon
sources. It was originally designed for the identification and classification of pure cultures of heterotrophic
bacteria (Bochner, 1989a, 1989b; Bochner and
Savageau, 1977). Later, Garland and Mills (1991) extended the method to classify microbial communities
of different environmental samples and to characterize
their functional potential. With these 95 different carbon sources, microbial communities produce a repro-

ducible and site-specific activity pattern. Multivariate
analysis of these patterns is then used to search for
relationships between samples from the different habitats. This assay, also called physiological profiling,
seems to be suitable for investigations of microbial
communities across spatial, temporal, or experimental
gradients.
The disposal or accidental release of organic and
inorganic compounds into the environment has resulted in a worldwide pollution of soil, groundwater,
and aquatic ecosystems, a main pollutant being hydrocarbons. Biodegradation of hydrocarbons by natural
populations of microorganisms is well known. Many
microorganisms are able to utilize these compounds as
a source of energy and carbon (Bossert and Bartha,
1984; Cerniglia et al., 1992; Song et al., 1986).
The massive pollution of the environment by hydrocarbons initiated the development of various technologies to treat contaminated soils, including physical, chemical, and biological remediation methods
(Skladany and Metting, Jr., 1993). Bioremediation is
often preferred, because the contaminants can be transformed to nonhazardous compounds at low costs, particularly by using in situ or on-site bioremediation
techniques. The metabolic abilities of the microorganisms determine the rate and degree of mineralization of
hydrocarbons, thus interest in quantifying impacts on
the biotic component of the soil ecosystem increases.
Traditionally, contaminated sites have been investigated using microbiological techniques like estimations of total cell counts, viable cell counts on different
media, or quantitation of physiologically specialized
groups (Alef, 1994; Alef and Nannipieri, 1995; Kampfer
et al., 1991) and the determination of the microbial
respiration activity of soil (Klein, 1992; Miethe et al.,
1994). Substrate utilization patterns allow a rapid assessment of the dynamics of microbial soil communities during bioremediation as well as an estimation of
their biodegradative potential.
This article describes the changes in substrate utilization of the microbial community during the

remediation of hydrocarbons and the effect of heavy
metals in static and constantly agitated soil.

Materials and Methods
Soil Preparation
Samples of pristine soil originated from the Botanical
Garden of Zurich and were taken from the top layer
of the A-horizon. The highly contaminated soil
came from a hydrocarbon-polluted site near Geneva,
Switzerland, and was obtained from the EBIOX
Remediation Company. All soil samples were homogenized and sieved and fractions <2 mm were used for
the experiments. For artificial contamination of control soil, soil material was mixed with defined amounts
of hydrocarbons or heavy metals (Table 1). These
substances were sprayed on the soil using a trigger
spray bottle, while the soil was mechanically mixed.
Phenanthrene was pulverized in a mortar and added as
a fine powder (2 g/kg). Original, pristine soil was used
as a reference to assess natural changes in community
composition during incubation.
Soil pH was measured in 1 M KCl solution. Dry
weight (dwt) was measured after drying at 105°C for
24 h. Water content (wet) and maximum water-holding capacity (WHC max) were determined by percolation with water after standing for an hour according to
published methods (Alef, 1994; Alef and Nannipieri,
1995).
In static incubation systems, soil samples of 1 kg
were incubated in polycarbonatejars in the greenhouse
at a mean temperature of 26°C and a humidity of 70%
to prevent drying. The water content of the soil was
kept constant at 25 to 30% (40 to 48% of maximum
water-holding capacity) during incubation. Samples
were taken at the beginning, 11 to 18 days, and 5 to 7
months after the addition of the pollutants, depending
on the experiment (exact duration is given in the legends to figures and tables). The microorganisms were
then extracted from the soil and the extract was used to
inoculate the microtiter plates.

To simulate an active bioremediation process, the
polycarbonate jars were equipped with a gassing system. Compressed air was released from the bottom
into the soil at a rate of 2.5 L/min. The reaction vessels
were kept at 22°C and the air was humidified by passage through a washing bottle containing sterile water.
Experiments under constantly agitated and aerated conditions were performed in a specially designed
100-L bioreactor (Saner et aI., 1996a) using 22 kg of
fresh soil. In this system, the soil is slowly agitated and
kept homogeneous at its original water content (24%)
by a planetoid mixing system. The activity of aerobic
soil organisms is measured as CO 2 production and O2
uptake in the efflux by on-line mass spectrometry
(PGA100, Leybold, Koln, Germany). Additionally, the
soil temperature is a good indicator of general biological activity of the soil. Before the addition of the
substrate hydrocarbons, the soil was mixed and aerated for 24 h. To minimize nutrition limitations in the
soil, a basal medium made in distilled water was used
(3.3 giL Na zHP0 4 , 1.6 giL KH zP0 4 , 0.1 giL
MgS0 407HzO, 0.02 gIL CaClzoHzO, 1.0 gIL NH4CI).
This basal medium was supplemented by a vitamin
and trace element solution (Pfennig and Lippert, 1966).

Microbial Populations
Microorganisms were extracted from the soil following the directions of Klein (1992). Ten-gram samples
of fresh, sieved soil were suspended in 100 mL sterile
0.2% tetrasodium pyrophosphate solution and shaken
in 250 mL flasks for 30 minutes (150 rpm) at room
temperature. After sedimentation at 1 g for about 5
minutes, the supernatant was taken to represent the
entire bacterial community. The diluted suspensions
(sterile 0.9% NaCI-solution) were used directly to inoculate Gram-negative (ON) Biolog" plates and to
determine the cell number. For actinomycetes and fungi,
the suspension was diluted in a gel-forming colloid
(0.2% Carageenan Type II) instead of 0.9 % NaCI.
This enhances growth and keeps the cells uniformly
suspended in the wells (BIOLOG, 1993, 1994).
The number of viable cells was determined by
standard plate count as colony-forming units (cfu) with
serial dilutions and three replicates of each on R2A
medium (Reasoner and Geldreich, 1985). Incubation
was at room temperature, and the colonies were counted
after 10 days.
Substrate utilization patterns of soil microbial
communities were obtained with Biolog" GN
microplate test panels with three replicate suspensions
from each sample. Soil suspensions were diluted 100fold with 0.9% saline to minimize background absorbance; 125 JlL were used for the inoculation of the

wells. The plates were incubated at room temperature
and the absorbance (590 nm) of the 96 wells was
recorded over 120 h (Reader 2001, Anthos Labtec
Instruments G.m.b.H., Salzburg, Austria). An incubation time of 72 h proved to be optimal for the soil
samples.
Sporulating and filamentous (SF) microorganisms
were tested on Biolog" SF-N microplates using the
same inoculum as before. One hundred microliters
each of chloramphenicol (10 mg/L), streptomycin sulfate (10 mg/L), and benzylpenicillin (20 mg/L) were
added to suppress bacterial growth in the soil suspension. The plates were incubated at room temperature
for several days. For .actinomycetes and fungi, the
incubation period was extended to 216 h. The 120-h
readings were taken to best represent the community
of sporulating and filamentous microbes. The SF-N
microplates are identical to the GN microplates except
the substrate wells lack the tetrazolium redox dye.
Optical density (OD) readings were made at 590 nrn
and indicated turbidity and thus growth. After inoculation, the SF-N microplates were incubated and the
absorption of each well was read after 24 to 120 hand
the data analyzed using Microsoft Excel".
The color intensity of Biolog" GN microtiterplates
is expressed as average well color development
(AWCD) and calculated as the mean of the 95 absorbance values corrected for the control background. In
SF-N plates lacking the electron acceptor dye, average
well turbidity (AWT = OD 590) was calculated similarly to express the overall growth in the 95 wells.

Chemical Analyses
Hydrocarbons were extracted from soil with an equal
amount of ethylacetate, the slurry treated with ultrasound, shaken, and centrifuged (Eschenbach et aI.,
1994; Saner et al., 1996a). Extracts were analyzed by
gas chromatography (DANI gas chromatograph [GC]
86.10 HT, with flame ionization detector [FID] 86/10
or the Gas Chromatograph Detector (GCD)-System
Hewlett Packard [HP] G1800A) on Altech Econo-Cap
capillary columns using 1 ~L of extract (injector temperature 250°C; carrier gas 1.0 mL/min helium; FID
275°C, split 1:50; temperature program: 1 min hold at
35°C, 35 to 200°C at 10°C/min ramp, 200 to 250°C at
5°C/min ramp). Diesel oil was quantified by adding up
the peak areas in the retention time interval from 3 to
14.5 min.

Statistical Treatment of Data
To compare samples with substantial variation in
AweD (or AWT), the data were normalized by
dividing the values for individual wells by the AWCD

43

(or AWT) for the sample (Garland, 1996a). In addition, the AWCD/AWT ratio for specific categories
of carbon sources was computed using the classification of Garland and Mills (1991) with 11 categories. This allowed for comparison of the activity on
polymers, carbohydrates, and carboxylic and amino
acids between soil samples. The number of substrates used by a microbial community is called
substrate richness (S) and was defined as the number of background-corrected absorbance values
greater than 0.5 absorbance units after 72-h incubation on GN microplates or after 120h on SF-N
microplates. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of
the background-corrected absorbance values at 590
nm were calculated between single samples and the
standard deviation (StD) among replicates was computed.
Data used in community ecology are often multivariate. The relationships between the patterns of
color formation also require multivariate statistical
analysis to reduce. the multidimensional data into a
more readily interpretable form. Characterization is
done on the basis of a number of variables, here the
respiratory activities of the microbial communities
on the 95 different substrates. Comparisons must be
made between plate readings of equivalent incubation times. The multivariate method of ordination
was used to concentrate the data and to find causal
or descriptive relations among samples (Gauch,
1982). From the numerous ordination techniques,
principal components analysis (PCA) has been chosen using background-corrected absorbance values.
PCA is an operation that projects the multivariate
data onto a reduced number of dimensions (principal components) that capture a subset of the total
variance in the data set (Pileou, 1984). With the
software DataMost (1994), best results were achieved
by selecting a variances-covariances matrix. The
data are summarized, but still display the original
pattern. For interpretation, the samples were plotted
using the component values as graphical coordinates.

Results
Population Changes during a 5-Month
Incubation of Soil with Hydrocarbons
in a Static System
Changes in community composition were followed in
a natural soil system that had been artificially contaminated with diesel oil or with phenanthrene. Diesel oil
was used as a model compound for general environmental pollution by hydrocarbons, and phenanthrene

44

represents a complex aromatic substance known to be
degraded by soil microorganisms (Fuenmayor and
Rodriguez Lemoine, 1992; Stringfellow and Aitken,
1994).
A 5-month incubation of pristine and highly polluted soil, parallel to experimentally contaminated soil
(1 % diesel or 0.2% phenanthrene) was carried out
under static aerobic conditions and analyzed after 11
and 166 days. During the first 11 days, only slight
changes in the composition of the endogenous microbial communities were observed. PCA (Figure 1)
showed high similarities between the different samples,
They were only separated by the first principal component (PC) (accounting for 80% of the variation in the
data). The second PC, which accounted for 7% of
variation, did not differ significantly. The small differences in metabolic potential between the artificially
contaminated soil and the control were also reflected
in high correlation coefficients (difference between
uncontaminated soil after 11 days [US 11 d]) and
phenanthrene-contaminated soil after 11 days [Ph 11
d]: r = 0.852; between uncontaminated soil [US 11 d]
and diesel-contaminated soil after 11 days [D 11 d]: r
= 0.835). During this short incubation time, the number of metabolized carbon sources decreased slightly
in all experiments (Table 2). The community extracted
from the reference sample showed a loss in substrate
richness of five Biolog" substrates, while in the artificially phenanthrene-contaminated soil five substrates
were no longer used and two substrates were new, and
in diesel oil-contaminated soil three were no longer
used and four become newly utilizable.
The relationships between the substrate utilization
patterns recorded after 166 days of incubation were
illustrated by the plot of principal components (Figure
1). This graph indicated that considerable changes
occurred in the metabolic patterns of the different soil
samples over this much longer incubation time. The
patterns became clearly separated by the first two principal components. The scatters of replicates, as indicated by error bars, did not overlap between the samples.
Seventy-two percent of total variance in the data were
explained by the first and 11% by the second PC axis.
Considerable shifts took place within the number of
metabolized substrates (Table 2). Furthermore, the
overall activity on the 95 Biolog" substrates decreased
generally during the second part of the incubation
(Figure 2), as did the substrate richness. The decrease
in AWCD after 166 days was mainly due to a loss of
activity on polymer and carbohydrate substrates (Figure 3).
The small change during the first 11 days discussed above suggests that the microbial population

related to differences in the response in samples with
different coordinate values for that PC (Garland and
Mills, 1991). Samples with higher coordinate values
for PC 1 show a greater response for carbon sources
positively correlated to PC 1 when compared with
samples with low PC 1 scores. Poor correlation of a
carbon source to a PC does not mean that it was poorly
utilized by the samples, but rather that its utilization
was not different among samples with higher and lower
coordinate values for that PC. Analysis of PCI indicates that soil microbial communities with low scores
on this component (Figure 1) utilized the substrates
listed in Table 3 to a relatively lesser degree. Apart
from uridine, carbon sources positively correlated to
PCI were mostly polymers and carbohydrates (correlation coefficients of AWCD to PC 1 of the polymers:
r = 0.909; and carbohydrates: r = 0.773). Microbial
communities associated with high scores on the second component in PC analysis show a greater relative
utilization of the positively-correlated substrates
(o-mannose, t.-arabinose, t-rhamnose, n-sorbitol, and
itaconic acid) and a smaller utilization of negatively
correlated substrates (bromo-succinic acid, n-saccharic acid, n-glucuronic acid, and citric acid). The high
number of carbohydrates positively correlated to PC2
leads also to a high correlation coefficient of these
carbon sources (r :::: 0.940). The contaminated soil
from a remediation site was clearly different from its
composition at time zero and at the end the experiment.

Incubation of Soil with Heavy Metals
in a Static System
Pristine soil was experimentally amended with the
heavy metals cadmium, mercury, copper, and arsenic
to concentrations of 1000 ppm, and microbial carbon
source utilization was analyzed after 18 and 217 days.
Samples from the various treatments had different
patterns of carbon source utilization. The plot of the
first and second PC illustrated that arsenic and copper
stress induced a strong impact on the microbial community in only 18 days of incubation, while mercury
and cadmium had only minor effects within this time
scale (Figure 4). Seventy-eight percent of total variance accounted for the first PC. The second PC, which
explained 7% of the variance, clearly distinguished the
arsenic- and copper-treated samples from others that
were still closely related and formed a cluster together
with the control. The samples contaminated with the
different heavy metals were characterized by the lowered activity of the arsenic and copper samples in

changes in utilization in 20 substrates: 14 were no
longer used while six were new. After the addition of
copper, 13 substrates were no longer used. The corresponding control values were -7 and + 1. Interestingly,
AWCD as a measure of respiratory activity showed
only small differences on the 95 Biolog" substrates
after heavy metal contamination when compared with
the control.
After 217 days, the results were quite different.
The substrate richness and the AWCD both decreased
to low levels in all the contaminated samples as well as
in the control. With As, Cd, Cu, and Hg, 71, 71, 72,
and 63 substrates, respectively, were no longer used.
Only with Hg were nine substrates newly utilizable.
The corresponding control showed a loss of ability to
metabolize 49 substrates and an addition of 23 new
substrates. In the cadmium- and copper-treated samples,

the AWCD reached mean values of less than 0.05
absorbance units and produced the largest distance to
the control sample (US initial, Figure 5). The decrease
in substrate richness and metabolic activity of the pristine control sample was probably due to exhaustion of
nutrients after the long incubation time (Figure 6).

It is well known that mineralization of hydrocarbons is

aeration system used in these experiments simulates in

not volatilization was responsible for most of the loss.
A minor initial loss in diesel oil was caused by evaporation of the highly volatile components. The addition
of copper negatively affected the degradation of diesel
oil components.
Carbon source utilization profiles were analyzed
after three weeks (Figure 7). In PCA of the carbon
source utilization, the first covariance PC axis accounted for 78%, and the second axis accounted for
7% of the variation in the data. PC axis 1 had the
highest correlations to the substrates i.-aspartic acid,
glucose-6-phosphate, glucose-I-phosphate, and su-

senic (0.1 % of dwt each) and the hydrocarbons quantified during a 3-week incubation. The phenanthrene
content dropped to 10% of the starting value in the
static system due to microbial activity (Figure 6).
Aeration did not stimulate the degradation rate, indicating that a factor other than the diffusion of oxygen
was rate limiting. As expected, the addition of copper
or arsenic resulted in a significant inhibition of phenanthrene degradation. In diesel oil-contaminated soil, the
amount of total hydrocarbons decreased to 40% of the
original value, independent of the use of the aeration
system, indicating that hydrocarbon degradation and

erose. These were the substrates for which consistent
differences were observed in the degree of substrate
utilization between the communities. The second PC
axis was highly correlated to the oxidation of inosine,
D-galactonic acid lactone, D-galactose, cellobiose, glucose-l-phosphate, r-arabinose, maltose, and gentiobiose. Although the degradation rate for diesel was
similar, parallel samples (one aerated and the other
not) differed significantly in community analysis.
Thus, forced aeration changed the soil community
composition much more than the rate of diesel degradation.
The largest shifts in the substrate utilization pattern were observed in samples contaminated with heavy
metals. These samples also showed the lowest substrate richness and overall activity. Cu and As addition
resulted in a loss of ability to degrade 20 to 25 substrates and hardly a gain of new ones. Again, the
ability to degrade polymers and carbohydrates was
mainly altered by the presence of copper or arsenic.
The number of colony-forming units indicated that
heavy metal-adapted microbial populations were still
highly capable of growing on a complex medium such
as R2A. The colonies were smaller, but their number
had increased strongly in the presence of diesel or

phenanthrene irrespective of whether Cu or As were
added. This showed that within 3 weeks additional
carbon sources led to excess growth of heavy metaltolerant microorganisms that can be cultivated on R2A
medium. Particularly diesel oil, which contains a variety of hydrocarbons, led to an increased number of
cultivable cells.

Population Changes during a 1-Week
Incubation of Soil with Hydrocarbons
in an Agitated Aerated Soil Bioreactor
In contrast to the previous experiments with a static
system with soil in pots, these experiments were conducted in a sophisticated soil reactor developed for
testing soil prior to large-scale bioremediation projects
(Saner et al., 1996a, 1996b). Figure 8 shows the time
course with CO 2 liberation and temperature, which is
also a good measure of biological activity. After substrate addition (dodecane [2 gIL], naphthalene [0.5 gIL],
and anthracene [0.5 gIL]), an initial peak in CO 2
emerged from the soil, but within a few hours CO 2
production ceased. CO 2 evolution recovered after adding the basal mineral medium containing trace elements and vitamins. The day-night fluctuation of the
soil temperature indicates changes in ambient tem-

perature in the laboratory. The addition of the mineral
medium initiated a temperature increase due to higher
biological activity after nutrient supply.
Substrate utilization patterns with ON and SF-N
plates were obtained after 1, 3, and 5 days of operation
and compared with the initial conditions. The overall
activity (AWCD) on the ON plates correlated well
with respiration activity found during the remediation
process. Ordination produced from PCA of microbial
communities indicated a temporal trend toward lower
values on the first and second PC (Figure 9). Evaluation of the variables that highly correlated with the first
axis showed an increase in utilization of ~-hydroxybu­
tyric acid, quinic acid, and L-aspartic acid during the
remediation time. Correlation to the second axis indicated a decrease in utilization of D-melibiose as carbon
source.
The PCA of patterns derived from SF-N plates,
indicative of the metabolic activity of sporulating and
filamentous microorganisms, resulted in a different
ordination plot (Figure 10). Only the sample taken
after 5 days was separated from previous ones. Fungi
on SF-N plates showed a much slower response to the
hydrocarbon mixture than bacteria on ON plates. This
suggested that under these conditions the effect of
slower-growing microorganisms was observed. The
clear separation on day 5 was caused by an increase in

Discussion
Cell number and species diversity of microorganisms
are strongly determined by the regime of the dominating environmental factors. Without doubt, pollutants
entering an ecosystem will have a strong influence on
biodiversity, inducing both a loss in prevailing physiological activities and a gain of new ones. Thus, it is
of great interest to follow the changes in microbial
diversity during the remediation process.
The results presented illustrate that the analysis of
the substrate utilization pattern as exemplified by the
Biolog" system is a rapid and simple approach to
assess the potential functional biodiversity of soil microorganisms without the tedious isolation and identification of single community members. Samples are
differentiated in time series or show community changes
due to different treatments. Different temporal trends
become apparent in the communities. PCA separates

Population Changes of Soil Microbial Communities

soil samples typically on the basis of responses that are
high in one community and correspondingly low in
other ones. The correlation of the carbon sources tested
with the principal components can be used to evaluate
the functional basis for differences among the samples.
Additionally, patterns of overall substrate use (AWCD)
can be viewed separately from the utilization of particular categories of substrates. This provides information at different levels of functional resolution.
Like other culture-based procedures, the method
is selective. It only detects activities from bacteria
capable of growing on the substrates and the nutrient
medium provided by Biolog". Oligotrophic microorganisms and obligate anaerobic bacteria do not respond. Furthermore, the Biolog" community assay reflects a functional potential rather than an in situ activity
(Garland and Mills, 1991). Haack et al. (1995) showed
that Biolog" carbon source utilization profiles of whole
microbial communities are reproducible and unique
for different communities, but they are not simply the
sum of those activities exhibited by community members when tested separately. Thus, differences in substrate utilization profiles for replicate soil samples indicate real differences in community composition,
mainly due to microscale heterogeneity in the soil.
Comparing the microorganisms that grow in each
Biolog" well to the total community that is present in
the sample might help to increase the value of substrate utilization patterns for biodiversity analysis.
Molecular methods based on DNA or 16S rRNA can
provide an estimate of the fraction of community
members that respond to the Biolog" assay conditions.
Analyses of dominant nucleic acid fragments in the
Biolog" wells by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis have been shown to give evidence for a reduction in diversity and selective enrichment of a few
strains in the presence of the Biolog" substrates (Smalla
et aI., 1998).
Several statistical approaches allow the evaluation of multivariate data, such as Biolog" substrate
utilization patterns. Here, PCA has been chosen to
illustrate the relationships between samples concerning their catabolic potential. PCA ordination technique
separates different samples along the first and second
PC, which typically account for more than 80% of the
variation in the data set. The major relationships among
samples are visualized by examining the relative similarity of the principal component scores of their carbon
source utilization patterns. Differences among samples
are analyzed by evaluating the correlation of the original variables to the principal components. Other forms
of ordination are canonical correspondence analysis
(Bossio and Scow, 1995; Grayston et aI., 1994) or

53

detrended correspondence analysis (Garland, 1996a;
Garland, 1996b), of which all have been applied successfully to establish distinctions among community
substrate utilization profiles.
Replicate soil samples, mean scores, and standard
deviation among the replicates for the first and second
PC help to evaluate whether the Biolog'" assay will
distinguish between different samples. The length of
error bars reflects mainly microscale spatial heterogeneity in the soil. Short incubation times after the stress
application, for example, the addition of a pollutant, do
not sufficiently resolve in the patterns of substrate
utilization. However, over longer incubation times, the
Biolog" assay allows one to follow changes in soil
microbial communities.
The microbial communities analyzed were all
highly active in the presence of hydrocarbon contamination, confirming that the ability to utilize these compounds is widespread among microorganisms, even
from environments where no hydrocarbon pollution is
expected. Hydrocarbon-contaminated samples generally show higher metabolic potentials, when compared
with uncontaminated samples, after the same incubation time, suggesting that microbial communities in
soil are mainly limited by the available carbon. Often
a high initial activity in soil samples is observed, probably due to the soil preparation, as homogenization
and sieving enlarge the surface area and facilitate oxygen availability Therefore, the activity and substrate
richness at the beginning of the experiments is probably overestimated.
Heavy metals, especially copper and arsenic, had
a drastic inhibitory effect on average activity as well as
on the richness of the microorganisms according to the
Biolog" analysis. Plating on rich medium, however,
indicated that the cell number growing under these
conditions increased. Thus, a stress-resistant population of low diversity had multiplied faster than the
population in the control soil.
Although aeration in a static system had no effect
on the degradation rate of diesel or phenanthrene, the
microbial population extracted from these soils differed greatly. Active aeration compared with oxygen
supply by simple diffusion changed oxygen gradients
and increased oxic sites. Thus, the degradation of hydrocarbons must have been limited by factors other
than oxygen.
Agitation combined with aeration greatly increases
oxygen mass transfer within the soil (Saner et al.,
1996a, 1996b). This suggests that oxygen was not the
limiting factor for hydrocarbon degradation in this
system. The addition of the basic inorganic nutrients
supplied with trace elements and vitamins stimulated

the metabolism as indicated by CO2 liberation and
temperature increase. The fast-reacting organisms (GNplates) resulted in population changes by the second
day, while slow-growing organisms hardly separated
on PC analysis until day 5.
Several approaches may help to draw more information from substrate utilization patterns between
microbial communities:
1. Use of additional specific carbon sources on
Biolog MT microplates lacking the carbon
source. Functional shifts might be more readily
detected in contaminated samples if alternative carbon sources are selected (e.g. the contaminants or substrates that are known not to
be generally utilized) (Insam, 1997).
2. Continuous recording of the kinetics of the
color formation instead of end-point measurements. Such profiles could further characterize the community change over time and increase the analytical power of the method.
3. Strict control of the inoculation size, because
this influences the kinetics of color development (Garland et al., 1997; Winding and
Hendriksen, 1997), that is, by basing inoculation on equal DNA or protein in a sample.
