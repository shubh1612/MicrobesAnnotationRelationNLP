Abstract
In this work, we present our experience in the engineered in situ biostimulation of a hydrocarbon-polluted subsoil of an old metalworking plant. The site had a long history of fuel, lubricant oil, and diesel spills and leakages that were initially treated by means of
physico-chemical techniques. After one year of treatment, weathered hydrocarbons were firmly sorbed in the unsaturated zone, limiting the effectiveness of the physico-chemical methods being applied. Also, low nutrient and dissolved oxygen levels limited natural
attenuation yields. Therefore, a bioremediation approach based on the injection of hydrogen peroxide, an oleophilic fertilizer, and
a surfactant was applied. Total petroleum hydrocarbons and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry determinations were performed
as a chemical means of monitoring the process. Microbial populations, including the presence of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria,
were simultaneously analyzed during the process, using enrichment techniques and confocal laser scanning microscopy observations
with fluorescent indicators. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were already present in the polluted subsoil prior to the implementation
of this bioremediation technique and increased noticeably during the first 2 months of treatment. Hence, the suitability of the nutrient
and oxygen amending approach was confirmed as further demonstrated by chemical determinations.

for years to remediate these hydrocarbon-polluted sites.
Bioremediation is an environmentally friendly treatment and allows ‘‘brownfields’’ to be redeveloped by
removing residual contaminants in soil and groundwater [39]. Specifically, in situ treatments are wellknown and cost-effective methods that usually eliminate
the need for expensive excavation and emission control
[48]. Thus, microbiological decontamination of petroleum hydrocarbons in polluted environments is claimed
to be an efficient, economic, and versatile alternative, or
complement, to physico-chemical treatments [30,26].

However, before starting in situ bioremediation protocols, it is important to establish the indigenous microbial
potential and to assess the limiting factors to be controlled during treatment [21].
Aerobic treatments for hydrocarbon bioremediation
are the preferred way to improve degradation yields,
given that the most common degraders are aerobic
[47,49,10]. For this reason, engineering systems or
chemical amendments are usually applied in order to
oxygenate the groundwater and soil. For instance, both
solid and liquid peroxides have been used in hydrocarbon bioremediation. In particular, hydrogen peroxide
is probably the most widely used product, thanks to its
high oxygen-releasing potential. Furthermore, this treatment is easy to dose, inexpensive, non-persistent, and
safe when properly used [25,38]. Another constraint
that must be considered for effective bioremediation, is
the nutrient level at the site of intervention. Oleophilic
fertilizers are one of the most widely used products for
natural environment amendment. In light of the fact
that they adhere to hydrocarbons and provide nutrients
at the oilewater interface, they have been extensively
applied in marine oil spills [7,11]. Moreover, recent
developments have proposed the usefulness of these
products for treating hydrocarbon-polluted groundwater
and soil [19].
The presence of bacteria with degrading capacities is
a critical aspect of bioremediation [18,9,27], while the
availability of contaminants is a major factor in biodegradation [21]. Hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms
produce a variety of surface-active agents that improve
bioavailability [40], but an exogenous surfactant may
still be required when the contaminants are highly
hydrophobic and/or firmly sorbed in clay particles or organic matter within the soil. Therefore, surfactants have
been used in bioremediation technologies to improve
the bioavailability of organic compounds and, hence,
biodegradation rates [46,29,35]. With the aforementioned considerations in mind and after a complete
screening, it was decided that the field approach applied
in this work would consist of the addition of an
oleophilic fertilizer, an oxygen-releasing compound
(hydrogen peroxide), and a commercial surfactant.
The microbial community and populations of hydrocarbon-degraders were monitored simultaneously with the
changes in the composition of the contaminants as an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the in situ approach
selected. Additional objectives included the characterization of the predominant indigenous microorganisms
before, during, and after biostimulation and the assessment of bacterial activity/viability using fluorescence
techniques. The evolution of microbial populations

311

was studied using the combination of conventional
laboratory techniques such as microbial counting and selective enrichment. The diversity of pollutant-degrading
microorganisms was analyzed by means of 16S rRNA
gene studies [5,32,28].
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemical methods
2.1.1. Hydrocarbon analysis
Groundwater and soil samples were collected in appropriate bottles which were sealed and stored in the
dark at 4  C. After extracting the hydrocarbon with dichloromethane (EPA Method 8015), the total petroleum
hydrocarbons (TPH) content was determined in both
groundwater and soil samples by gas chromatographyflame ionization detector (GC-FID). Further characterization of pollutants and control of biodegradation was
performed with gas chromatographyemass spectrometry (GCeMS) techniques. For liquid samples, hydrocarbon extraction was conducted by circulation through
a solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge (EPA Method
3535) and subsequent washing with 20 ml dichloromethane. Soil samples and pure product analyses were
conducted by extraction using a Soxhlet apparatus and
purified by liquid chromatography (EPA Method
3540C). Both SPE and liquid chromatography extracts
were injected into a gas chromatograph (GC) system
HP 6890 Series equipped with a capillary column
(AT5 Alltech, 25 m length and 0.25 mm internal diameter). The column oven temperature was raised from
60  C to 300  C at 6  C/min and the injector temperature was set at 275  C. This equipment was linked to
a mass detector (MSD) HP 5973 Series which allowed
peak area determinations in selective ion mode (SIM)
using the Wiley 275 database (EPA Method 8270C).
Chemical biomarker determinations (isoprenoids and
hopanes) were used to evaluate biodegradation [50,37].
2.1.2. Groundwater monitoring
Levels of dissolved oxygen, pH, redox potential, and
conductivity were controlled weekly in the injection
and monitoring wells by standard electrodes (Hanna Instruments). Nitrogen (both nitrate and ammonium) and
phosphorus consumption were determined by means of
spectrophotometric methods (Hach Instruments).
2.2. Microbiological methods
Different microbiological methods were used in the
first screening (carried out before implementation of

312

D. Menendez-Vega et al. / European Journal of Soil Biology 43 (2007) 310e321

the bioremediation intervention) and in the subsequent
monitoring program during and after bioremediation.
2.2.1. Microbial counts and selective
enrichment techniques
Microbial populations in the different monitoring
wells of the four polluted zones were periodically monitored by conventional plate-counting using two types
of growth media. The first one was a rich complex
medium (CM) designed for growing most culturable
chemo-organotrophic bacteria (Tryptic Soy Broth
(TSB), Merck, 0.05% yeast extract, and 1.5% agar).
The second one was the solid degradation medium
(DM) (0.3% NH4NO3; 0.05% MgSO4$7H2O; 2%
CaCl2$2H2O; 0.007% K2HPO4; 0.05% KH2PO4; 2%
agar with 0.5% commercial filter-sterilized diesel as
the sole carbon source) used to recover most culturable
hydrocarbon degraders. Plate counts in both cases were
performed as follows: an 80 ml sample of groundwater
was obtained in sterile conditions and centrifuged for
10 min at 15,000 rpm; the resulting sediment was then
diluted with 4 ml of sterile distilled water. Then 2 ml
were taken for enrichment techniques, 1 ml for microscopic examinations and the rest for 10-fold serial dilutions that were spread over the surface of duplicate agar
plates. The media were incubated at 30  C for 48 h in
the case of CM and 1 week for DM; colonies were
counted to quantify the total indigenous bacterial CFU
and hydrocarbon-degrader content. Enrichment techniques were conducted in DM liquid medium with the
following carbon sources: 2% fuel oil; 2% lubricant
oil; and 2% of diesel fuel (depending on the area from
which the sample was taken). Two milliliters of the
concentrated groundwater (see above) were added to
100 ml of medium and incubated in a rotary shaker at
250 rpm and 30  C for 5 days. Two milliliters of the culture were then inoculated again in 100 ml of the same
medium. This procedure was repeated three times.
2.2.2. Bacteria identification and RFLP grouping
Sequence analysis of 16S bacterial ribosomal DNA
(16S rDNA) was performed on selected isolates after
DNA extraction by a commercial kit (Chemagic Bac
100 Kit, Chemagen). The 16S rDNA was amplified
by PCR using the conserved eubacterial primers pA
(50 -AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-30 ) and pH
(50 -AAG GAG GTG ATC CAG CCG CA-30 ) [8]. The
50 ml reaction mixture contained 2 mM dNTPs mix
(Amersham Biosciences), 30 pmol/ml of each primer
(pA and pH), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 polymerase buffer,
0.2 ml Eco Taq DNA polymerase (Ecogen), and finally,
the mixture was overlaid with 50 ml mineral oil. The

PCR program was as follows: denaturation at 95  C
for 5 min; 30 cycles of 1 min at 95  C; annealing for
1 min at 57  C; and extension for 90 s at 72  C; followed by a final extension at 72  C for 10 min. The amplification products (1500 pbs) were routinely analyzed
by horizontal gel electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gel in
TriseBorateeEDTA (TBE), followed by ethidium
bromide staining and visualization under UV light.
Lambda phage DNA digested with PstI restriction enzyme was included on the gel in order to confirm the
size of the amplified product. PCR products from the
extracted bands were purified by GFXÔ PCR DNA
and Gel Band Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences)
as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Species were grouped by restriction fragment length
polymorphism analysis (RFLP) of the 16S rDNA with
HaeIII, AluI, and HhaI endonucleases to reduce the
number of isolates by identifying duplicates. The
20 ml restriction digestion mixture contained 1 U of enzyme, 10 restriction enzyme buffer, and 0.5e1.0 mg
DNA. The mixture was incubated at 37  C for 2 h and
the reaction products were analyzed on a 3% agarose
gel in TBE, followed by SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) staining and visualization under UV light. Finally, 16S
rDNA sequences from the different restriction profile
groups were obtained in an ABI PrismÔ 3100 Genetic
Analyzer (Perking Elmer) and identification was made
using the Gapped BLAST database search program
facility of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [1].
2.2.3. Microscopy techniques
Basic morphological information of samples was obtained by phase contrast microscopy observations under
a Nikon Eclipse E-200 microscope with a Nikon CoolPix 990 digital camera. Bacterial viability was analyzed
by staining the cells with propidium iodide (PI) and
SYTO 9 green fluorescent nucleic acid stain (LIVE/
DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit, Molecular
Probes) at a wavelength of 488 nm and 568 nm excitation, respectively, and at 530 nm (green) or 630 nm
(red) emission. In the presence of both stains, bacteria
with intact cell membranes appear fluorescent green,
whereas membrane-compromised bacteria appear red
[20]. Cell activity was analyzed by incubating the cells
for 15 min at 30  C in a carboxyfluorescein diacetate
(CFDA) solution [24] at a final concentration of
30 mM. Cells were then washed twice with distilled
water and observed directly under the CLSM microscope at a wavelength of 488 nm excitation and
530 nm emission. Cell membrane potential was analyzed by staining the cells with rhodamine 123, which

D. Menendez-Vega et al. / European Journal of Soil Biology 43 (2007) 310e321

is a vital stain that selectively accumulates in cells with
an intact membrane potential and has been widely employed in prokaryotic cell studies [33]. Samples were
incubated at 30  C for 15 min in a 0.2 mg/ml final concentration solution of rhodamine 123 (Sigma), washed
twice with distilled water, and observed under CLSM
at a wavelength of 514 nm excitation and 563 nm emission. A Leica TCS-SP2-AOBS confocal laser-scanning
microscope was used. The images obtained were mixed
using the Leica Confocal Software.
2.3. Products and dosages for in situ bioremediation
Three products and dosages were used in the bioremediation approach. The first product was S200, an
oleophilic fertilizer distributed by IEP (http://www.
iepeurope.com) and selected to enhance nutrient levels.
It is a relatively new product and is listed as a bioremediation agent in the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), USA. Its
composition (urea, phosphoric ester, water, oleic acid,
and glycol ether) boosts emulsification, thereby
enabling dilution to take place. As previously tested in
our lab, S200 improves hydrocarbon biodegradation
(data not shown). The product was injected and infiltrated at appropriate dosages, according to the total
amount of hydrocarbons present in the different areas
of the subsoil and adjusted to a C:N ratio of 10:1. The
second product used was diluted hydrogen peroxide
(250 mg/l), which was applied in continuous injections
that completed an amount congruent with the stechiometric oxygen demand of the hydrocarbons polluting
the site (approximately 2500 kg; see Section 3). This
dosification was adjusted weekly to achieve and sustain
dissolved oxygen levels of 6e8 mg/l in the polluted
groundwater. The third compound was Bioversal HC,
a biodegradable chemical surfactant commonly used
in hydrocarbon remediation and distributed in Spain
by IEP Europe. It was infiltrated from trenches to
‘‘wash’’ the hydrocarbons sorbed in the unsaturated
zone. The dosages were selected on the basis of our previous experiences at other field sites and on manufacturers’ recommendations (1 kg of surfactant per 10 kg
of hydrocarbons to be desorbed).
3. Results
3.1. Field site description and previous works
The field site studied was the subsoil of an old metalworking factory, located in northern Spain and polluted
by different mixtures of hydrocarbons released over

313

several decades of industrial activity (Fig. 1). At the beginning of 2002, a detailed study of the site pollution
and local hydrogeology was performed, revealing
more than 7000 kg of low density non-aqueous phase
liquids (LNAPL) affecting the groundwater and slowly
flowing towards a main river close to the factory, as
well as 3000 kg of hydrocarbons firmly sorbed in the
vadose zone covering a total surface area of around
2 ha. The different boreholes drilled enabled three contaminant plumes and a fourth area to be located that
corresponded with mixtures of the three contaminants.
Therefore, four zones were delimited (Fig. 1): Z1 for
the fuel-oil spilled from a heating system; Z2 for the
lubricant-oil leaked from metal-working units; Z3 for
diesel fuel spilled from underground tanks; and Z4 for
a perimeter with mixtures of the three contaminants.
In addition, hydrogeological studies detected water
tables ranging from 3 m in the areas closest to the river
up to 6 m in the areas furthest away. Finally, the data
obtained from the boreholes and geophysical studies
revealed that the heterogeneous characteristics of the
subsoil mainly comprised of complex mixtures of alluvial sediments, loams, clay, and dolomite, combined
with anthropic fillers (slag and building waste).
Remediation works started with physico-chemical
techniques that included the installation of a hydraulic
barrier to keep groundwater from being discharged
into the river, as well as the implementation of
a ‘‘pump and treat’’ system to remove free phases of hydrocarbons from the polluted groundwater. After more
than one year of treatment, most of the LNAPLs were
removed (monthly removal of approximately 500 l of
hydrocarbons). Nevertheless, some LNAPLs remained,
in addition to the weathered contaminants sorbed to the
soil in the unsaturated zone, which promoted periodic
hydrocarbon leaching into the groundwater, depending
on water table fluctuations.
3.2. Initial screening and implementation of a
bioremediation approach
In the spring of 2003, monthly sampling and subsequent TPH analysis revealed decreasing efficiency
of the ‘‘pump and treat’’ system. The analysis showed
that approximately 2000 kg of hydrocarbons were being
consistently retained in the unsaturated zone and in
around 500 kg of free phases in the groundwater
throughout the site. At that time, the soil and groundwater were studied in order to choose a suitable bioremediation strategy and to establish successive monitoring.
GCeMS analysis indicated the presence of different
profiles, corresponding to the three contaminant plumes

previously mentioned (Fig. 2). Irrespective of the age of
the spills, all the contaminants (but in particular the fueloil) had been affected by strong weathering (Fig. 2).
The complete geochemical characterization revealed
common features in all the zones studied, such as the low
bioavailability of contaminants (predominantly the
heavy hydrocarbons detected in the unsaturated zone)
as determined by the geological nature of the subsoil previously described, and the absence of appropriate levels
of nutrients and dissolved oxygen (N levels less than
1 mg/l and P less than 0.1 mg/l in most monitoring wells;
average dissolved O2 levels were below 2 mg/l) for aerobic groundwater bioremediation purposes. Microbial
populations with hydrocarbon-degrading metabolic
abilities were also detected (see below). Therefore,
a 4 month sequential treatment with proper dosages of
the above mentioned products was implemented, in order to stimulate microbial activity. Soil washing (surfactant infiltration), fertilizer injection, and microbiological
chemical sampling were performed in the first, second,
and fourth week of each month, respectively. H2O2 injection was continuous and groundwater monitoring
was carried out once a week during the entire treatment
period. The treatment was initially designed to continue
for up to six or eight months, but the excellent results

obtained made it possible to conclude earlier than
expected. For this extension, the existing pumping system was improved by digging trenches and new wells to
enable the amendments (diluted hydrogen peroxide and
the oleophilic fertilizer S-200) to be injected/infiltrated.
Prior to these periodic injections, the surfactant Bioversal HC was infiltrated through the unsaturated zone to
initially desorb as much of the hydrocarbon content
remaining above the water table as possible.
3.3. Monitoring of in situ bioremediation
After transitory fluctuations, amendment dosages
(hydrogen peroxide, S-200, and Bioversal HC) were
finally adjusted to achieve adequate levels of dissolved
oxygen (5e10 mg/l, irrespective of the monitoring
well) and nutrients. Average N levels of 10 mg/l and
P levels of approximately 2 mg/l in the groundwater
were reached during the treatment period. Wherever it
was needed, the nutrient injection was decreased to
avoid eutrophication. The pH ranged from 6.5 to 8
and average conductivity of 600 mS/cm were also measured. Finally, subsoil temperatures ranged between
22  C and 26  C (treatment was implemented during
the summer). Plate counting revealed a remarkable

2e3 months of biostimulant injection in all the zones
sampled (Fig. 3aec). However, bacteria numbers subsequently declined, especially those growing in DM
medium. The noticeably lower values corresponding

to the samples collected during month 4 can be partially
accounted for by a dilution effect, due to an elevation of
the water table following a rainy period. After completing the process, the CM and DM microbial populations
returned to their initial values (Fig. 3a,b) and even fell

to below initial levels (Fig. 3c). Average values of samples obtained from the monitoring wells (Fig. 3d)
clearly confirmed the same trend as described above:
a noticeable increase of microbial populations at the
beginning of treatment, followed by a decline at the
end of the intervention to levels that were slightly lower
than the initial values.
Selective enrichment enabled a significant number
of hydrocarbon-degraders from the four zones to be isolated. Within these strains, further selection was carried
out based on two criteria: persistence throughout the
enrichment procedure and the presence of the same
microorganisms in several samples of the same or different zones. The most abundant strains isolated after
plate-counting of the successive enrichments were
grouped by RFLP analysis and characterized by conventional microbiological determinations (gram, oxidase test, morphology, mobility) prior to undergoing
detailed identification. Sequence analysis of 16S bacterial ribosomal DNA of the isolates detected different
bacterial genera throughout the process (Table 1). The
most widely represented genera with respect to the

species encountered (Table 1) were Pseudomonas, followed by Acinetobacter, Microbacterium, Ralstonia,
Achromobacter, Micrococcus, Ochrobactrum, and Rhodococcus. Further analysis of the different species from
the genera listed in Table 1, identified Achromobacter
xylosoxidans (Accession DQ303927), Acinetobacter
sp. (Accession DQ303926), Microbacterium oxydans
(Accession AY785738), Ochrobactrum anthropi (Accession AY776289), and Pseudomonas putida (Accession DQ112329) as the most common species isolated
throughout the monitorization of the different zones.
On the other hand, CLSM observations from direct in
situ samples and enrichment cultures distinctly revealed
the viability and activity of the microorganisms, as well
as their interaction with the contaminants (Fig. 4).
Finally, microbial activity was also confirmed by
TPH determinations of groundwater samples during
the process. The results show a remarkable decrease
in hydrocarbon concentrations from the very first month
of treatment (Table 2). By the end of the fourth month of
treatment, groundwater TPH levels were negligible and
contaminant levels in the unsaturated zone were also

and a monitoring program for natural attenuation was
implemented to complete remediation works. GCeMS
studies of selected samples of the site demonstrated that
most of the degradation observed was attributable to
microbial activity (Figs. 5 and 6; see Section 4 for
details).

4. Discussion
Hydrocarbon-polluted soils and groundwater are
present in more than half of all sites that are subject to
bioremediation [4]. Although most of the components
of fuels and other petroleum derivatives are degradable,
natural biodegradation yields depend on the presence or

(arrow), whereas membrane-compromised bacteria appear red (arrowhead). Active (viable) cells are stained green with CFDA (arrow) due to the
presence of intracellular esterases. Also, live bacteria have an intact membrane potential and stain red with rhodamine 123 (arrow). These bacteria

All results are averages of at least three samples taken from different wells in each zone. The increase observed in zone Z2 after 6 months, was
probably due to an external contaminant.

absence of adequate degraders, oxygen, and nutrient
levels, and the bioavailability of the contaminants. As
extensively reported, hydrocarbon-degraders are ubiquitous [18,34], especially wherever there is a history
of hydrocarbon spills. Therefore, approaches such as
bioaugmentation are usually ruled out for in situ treatments and biostimulation approaches are preferred.
By adding N and P, the C/N and C/P ratios in the soil
approximate bacterial C/N and C/P requirements [6].
However, in our work, additional amendments to boost
aerobic metabolism and pollutant bioavailability were
required and a novel combination of a surfactant [15],
an oleophilic fertilizer, plus an oxygen-releasing compound was used to foster both biodegradation and soil
washing, thereby enhancing bioavailability. The results
proved that after the sequential application of these three
products, pollution levels clearly declined over a short
period of time, which coincided with the exponential
growth-phase of the microbial populations. Nevertheless, most of the contaminants were initially not very
biodegradable. For instance, a noticeable weathering
of hydrocarbons in the lubricant-polluted zone (Z2)
was observed prior to treatment (Fig. 5c) in comparison

with the pure compound that had been spilled
(Fig. 5a,b). This chemical composition, consisting of
a reduced presence of linear alkanes (caused by the
long time that had elapsed since the spillages had occurred), should not have promoted significant microbial
degradation. Nevertheless, the high specialization of the
populations (see below) and the activity of both the surfactant and oleophilic fertilizer made the remaining linear alkanes and other branched and cyclic compounds
available within a short period of time. Consequently,
the contaminants were further degraded during the treatment (Fig. 5d). Similar behaviors were observed in the
other zones studied, as shown in Fig. 6. These additional
results reveal that most of the reduction (Table 2) of the
TPH content in both groundwater and soil was due to
microbial activity.
As stated above, the process seemed to be particularly
efficient during the first two months, when hydrocarbondegraders were growing rapidly. This is not surprising if
we consider the long historical record of hydrocarbon
spillage at the site, which surely promoted the adaptation
of microbial populations. As a conclusion, a dual phase
pattern of degradation was observed that was

treatment (linear alkanes have completely disappeared (arrow), with only isoprenoids remaining (arrowhead)). Degradation of cyclic and branched
compounds was also observed.

characterized by initial fast degradation, followed by
slow degradation. Similar microbial behavior has been
reported by Vinas et al. [45] who found that the addition
of nutrients resulted in a high first-order degradation rate
during the first 45 days, which declined markedly after
90 days, at which point the sizes of heterotrophic and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degrading microbial populations returned to the initial values. Analogous results were obtained by Kaplan et al. [27]: TPH
degradation was rapid during the first 3 weeks and
then it slowed down for the remainder of the 24 week
project. During that study, a sharp increase in plate
counts was reported during the first 3 weeks, indicating
an increase in biomass associated with petroleum
degradation.
Fluorescent indicators of viability and/or activity have
been widely used in bacteria studies [31], although their
application to the environment, especially in bioremediation practices, has been scarcer [23,36,16]. As shown in
this work, these stains, in combination with CLSM observations, make it possible to directly observe the bacterial
viability status in both in situ samples and during the
enrichment process (Fig. 4). These analyses provide
a suitable complement to the investigation of bacterial
groups and their degrading capabilities and will become
increasingly useful in monitoring bacteria in, for

example, bioaugmentation experiments [23]. With respect to the characteristics of the microbial communities
involved in the degradation process, all the strains listed
in Table 1 are capable of growing in both liquid and DM
solid media with hydrocarbons as the sole carbon source.
Most of these genera (Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Rhodococcus, Stenotrophomonas, etc.) have been previously
described as hydrocarbon-degraders [43,48,12,44,17].
Remarkably, some Ochrobactrum species seemed to be
the most abundant bacteria in crude oil [51], although,
unlike in our results, it was not possible to isolate the bacterium in agar plates. The differences in the relative abundance of these bacterial genera may have to do with their
metabolic capabilities, which act on specific carbon sources, as well as the chemical composition of the existing
petroleum hydrocarbons during the different sampling
periods [28]. It is of interest to note the five most frequently isolated species throughout the whole study in
the different zones. Some of them, such as Pseudomonas
putida and Acinetobacter sp., have been previously
reported at many oil-contaminated sites [18,44,13,41].
Microbacterium oxydans has been isolated in petroleumcontaminated tropical soils [42]. Achromobacter xylosoxidans has not been described in oil-contaminated
soils, although it has been isolated in PAHs and toluidinecontaminated soils [22,2]. Finally, Ochrobactrum anthropi

has not been previously described in oil-contaminated
soils with the exception of a recent report [51] in which,
as in our work, this bacterium was often detected in the
oily samples analyzed. After contamination of pristine
soil with petroleum, an increase in microbial activity,
but a decrease in microbial diversity, is generally observed [3]. These phenomena had conceivably already
taken place in the subsoil studied here, given the long history of hydrocarbon pollution at the site. Despite this,
a further reduction in diversity of the cultivable bacteria
was observed (Table 1). This is probably due to the individual response of the bacteria to the carbon source depletion (Table 2). Communities can otherwise be expected to
behave differently in places where spills are recent [14].

5. Conclusion
[7]

This study has provided data regarding the successful application of amendments (oleophilic fertilizer,
surfactant, and hydrogen peroxide) to achieve in situ
bioremediation at a hydrocarbon-polluted site. The
identification of low dissolved oxygen levels and the
limited bioavailability of the hydrocarbons indicated
that the classic approach of providing additional nutrients
should be complemented by adding the other two products. The effectiveness of the selected bioremediation
strategy was particularly significant within the first two
months of treatment, revealing the previous adaptation
of the microbial populations due to their long-term exposure to leakages and spills. Moreover, the chemical analyses confirmed the disappearance of the contaminants
and hence the effectiveness of the treatment. In-depth
molecular studies are needed to fully understand the behavior of microbial communities during bioremediation
in contaminated environments such the one presented.
