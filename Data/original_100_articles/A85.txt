Bacterial degradation of pyridine, indole, quinoline,
and their derivatives under different redox conditions

Received: 26 September 1997 / Received revision: 23 December 1997 / Accepted: 27 December 1997

Abstract Bacteria have evolved a diverse potential to
transform and even mineralize numerous organic compounds of both natural and xenobiotic origin. This article describes the occurrence of N-heteroaromatic
compounds and presents a review of the bacterial
degradation of pyridine and its derivatives, indole,
isoquinoline, and quinoline and its derivatives. The
bacterial metabolism of these compounds under dierent redox conditions ± by aerobic, nitrate-reducing,
sulfate-reducing and methanogenic bacteria ± is discussed. However, in natural habitats, various environmental factors, such as sorption phenomena, also in¯uence
bacterial conversion processes. Thus, both laboratory
and ®eld studies are necessary to aid our understanding
of biodegradation in natural ecosystems and assist the
development of strategies for bioremediation of polluted
sites. Occurring predominantly near (former) woodtreatment facilities, creosote is a frequent contaminant
of soil, subsoil, groundwater, and aquifer sediments.
In situ as well as withdrawal-and-treatment techniques
have been designed to remediate such sites, which are
polluted with complex mixtures of aromatic and heterocyclic compounds.

Occurrence of N-heteroaromatic compounds
In nature, N-heterocyclic compounds perform a variety
of biological functions. They exist as electron carriers
[NAD(P)H, ¯avine nucleotides] and as constituents of
the nucleotides in RNA, DNA and in energy-storage
molecules (ATP, GTP). Other naturally occurring
N-heterocycles include pyridoxine (vitamin B6), various

porphyrines, melamine, and also mycotoxins and alkaloids. Quinoline derivatives have been isolated from seadwelling sponges (Alvarez et al. 1991), myxobacteria
(BoÈhlendorf et al. 1996), the cyanobacterium Lyngbya
majuscula (Orjala and Gerwick 1997), pseudomonads,
fungi, and ± most abundantly ± from higher plants
(Sainsbury et al. 1978, 1987). Quinine alkaloids produced by subtropical Cinchona and Remija sp. are used
as schizontocides against the erythrocytic stage of the
malaria parasite (and also as beverage bitters).
Numerous man-made compounds ± pharmaceuticals,
dyes, industrial solvents, and pesticides (such as s-triazines, paraquat, diquat, and picloram) ± are also based
on N-heterocyclic compounds. N-heteroaromatics are
produced mainly from coal tar. Tars are produced by
low-temperature carbonization, coking, or gasi®cation
of fossil raw material or biomass (coal, lignite, peat,
wood, oil shale). Shale oil contains especially high concentrations of nitrogen compounds (Bett et al. 1983).
Approximately 15 ´ 106 t year)1 coal tars are produced
worldwide, mainly high-temperature coal tars from
coking plants. These are the basic material for industrial
carbon products (approx. 4 ´ 106 t year)1), technically
pure condensed aromatic hydrocarbons (approx.
1 ´ 106 t year)1), technically pure heteroaromatics such
as carbazole, quinoline, pyridine, and indole (several
thousand t year)1), phenols (several hundred thousand
t year)1), thermoplastic indenecoumarone resins (approx. 100 ´ 103 t year)1), and aromatic oils used as
wood preservatives, solvents, and gas-washing oils
(>2 ´ 106 t year)1) (Collin and HoÈke 1995). The approximate contents of N-heteroaromatic compounds in
high-temperature coal tar are 0.9% carbazole, 0.2%±
0.3% quinoline, 0.2% indole, 0.1%±0.2% isoquinoline,
0.1%±0.2% 2-methylquinoline, 0.1% acridine, 0.03%
pyridine, and 0.02% 2-methylpyridine (Collin and HoÈke
1989, 1993, 1995). Quinoline (world production >2000 t
year)1; Collin and HoÈke 1993) and carbazole are obtained exclusively from coal tar. In contrast, pyridine
bases, although constituents of tars, are produced by
synthesis. The amounts of pyridine bases produced

238

worldwide (in 1989) were estimated as follows: pyridine,
26000 t year)1, 2-methylpyridine 8000 t year)1, 3-methylpyridine 9000 t year)1, 4-methylpyridine 1500 t
year)1, 5-ethyl-2-methylpyridine 8000 t year)1 (Shimizu
et al. 1993).
In situ processes of shale oil production generate approximately equal volumes of retort waste water highly
contaminated with organic solutes (Sims and O'Loughlin
1989; Leenheer et al. 1982). Pyridine and quinoline (including isoquinoline) derivatives, for instance, are major
components in the basic fraction of shale oil process
waters with concentrations in the range 20±100 mg l)1
and 2±50 mg l)1 respectively (roughly estimated from
several reports: Richard and Junk 1984; Dobson et al.
1985; Zhu et al. 1988; Leenheer et al. 1982).
Although azaarenes may enter the environment
through a variety of sources, coal gasi®cation sites, oil
processing facilities, coal-tar wastes, and creosote are the
major ones (Table 1). Creosote is a distillate of coal tar.
It contains more than 200 individual compounds and
consists of up to 75%±85% (by weight) polynuclear
aromatic hydrocarbons, 5%±15% monoaromatic hydrocarbons, 1%±12% phenolic, and 3%±13% N-, S-,
and O-heterocyclic compounds (Mueller et al. 1989;
Godsy et al. 1994, Dyreborg et al. 1997). Quinoline,
isoquinoline, carbazole, 2,4-dimethylpyridine (each in
concentrations of about 10 mg l)1), acridine, 2- and
4-methylquinoline, pyrrole, and pyrrolidine (5 mg l)1

each) are the major N-heterocyclic compounds in creosote (Mueller et al. 1989). Many of the more than 700
wood-preserving plants in the U.S. use creosote as the
primary wood-preserving chemical. Creosoting operations within the U.S. were reported to consume approximately 4.5 ´ 107 kg creosote annually (Mattraw
and Franks 1986).
Heteroaromatic compounds generally are more polar
than their homocyclic analogs and possess lower octanol/water partition coecients (Kow) (for log Kow values,
see Hansch and Leo 1979; Sims and O'Loughlin 1989;
Ondrus and Steinheimer 1990). Owing to their relatively
high water solubilities and weak sorption to soil and
aquifer organic material, many heteroaromatic pollutants are readily transported to subsurface environments, resulting in contamination of subsoil and
groundwater (for reviews on groundwater pollution, and
analysis, see Canter and Sabatini 1994; Hale and Aneiro
1997; Mayer et al. 1997). Table 1 lists some cases of
groundwater pollution by N-heterocyclic compounds.
These contaminated ecosystems generally contain complex mixtures of coal tar compounds (polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolics, and heterocycles). At the
American Creosote Works Superfund site near Pensacola, Florida, an abandoned wood-treatment facility,
groundwater samples contained up to several milligrams
per liter each of quinoline, isoquinoline, and their oxo
derivatives, depending on the distance of the sampling

wells from the source of contamination (Pereira et al.
1987a, b; Godsy et al. 1992, 1994; Ondrus and Steinheimer 1990). A literature survey of the maximum concentrations of N±heteroaromatic compounds in
creosote-contaminated groundwater was reported by
Johansen et al. (1997a).
The contamination of groundwater by transport of
N-heteroaromatic compounds through soil and subsoils
is a major environmental concern, since many of these
compounds are considered toxic and/or mutagenic and
cancerogenic (Hirao et al. 1976; Nagao et al. 1977;
Santodonato and Howard 1981; LaVoie et al. 1988;
Willems et al. 1992). Apart from groundwater and
aquifers, N-heteroaromatic compounds have also been
identi®ed in aquatic sediments, industrial and urban air,
tobacco smoke, sea water, and the tissue of ®sh (Santodonato and Howard 1981; Adams et al. 1983; Barrick
et al. 1984; Warshawsky 1992).
There are a number of review articles on the microbial metabolism of both natural and xenobiotic Nheteroaromatic compounds. This mini-review describes
the pathways of bacterial degradation of pyridine and its
derivatives, indole, isoquinoline, and quinoline and its
derivatives. The biodegradation of these coal tar compounds under dierent redox conditions is compared,
environmental factors that in¯uence bacterial degradation processes are discussed brie¯y, and some biotechnological applications are indicated. For literature on
the degradation of purines, pyrimidines, tryptophan,
pyridoxine, acridine, and s-triazines, see, for example,
the reviews of Vogels and van der Drift 1976; Scazzocchio 1994; Callely 1978; Berry et al. 1987a; Bollag and
Kaiser 1991; Koenig and Andreesen 1992; Kaiser et al.
1996; Cook 1987.

Bacterial degradation under aerobic conditions
Degradation of N-heteroaromatic compounds very often is initiated by a hydroxylation adjacent to the Nheteroatom. This feature applies to pyridine (Fig. 1) and
derivatives such as nicotinate (Fig. 2), picolinate, isonicotinate (Fig. 3) as well as to isoquinoline (Fig. 4),
quinoline and various quinoline derivatives (Fig. 5), and
xanthine. The incorporated oxygen typically is derived
from water, and a number of molybdenum-containing
hydroxylases catalyzing these hydroxylation reactions
have been characterized thoroughly (for reviews on the
enzymology and genetics of this type of hydroxylation,
see Hille 1996; RomaÄo and Huber 1998; Fetzner et al.
1998). The utilization of pyrrole-2-carboxylate by Arthrobacter sp. strain Py1 and Rhodococcus sp. strain Sedi2,
however, is initiated by an oxygenation reaction, catalyzed by distinct NADH-dependent pyrrole-2-carboxylate monooxygenases (Hormann and Andreesen 1991,
1994; Becker et al. 1997).
Aerobic degradation in many cases involves several
hydroxylation steps, followed by dioxygenolytic cleavage

of the (hetero)aromatic ring. However, there are also
aerobic pathways involving reductive steps prior to ring
cleavage.
Pyridine and derivatives
Chemically, the pyridine ring is susceptible to reduction
and to attack by nucleophilic agents (preferably at C-2
and C-4). These characteristic properties have been
exploited by microorganisms for evolving mechanisms
for pyridine ring degradation. Two general strategies of
bacterial pyridine degradation involve (i) hydroxylation
reactions, followed by reduction, and (ii) (aerobic) reductive pathway(s) not initiated by hydroxylations (for
detailed reviews on the biodegradation of pyridine and
its derivatives, see Shukla 1984; Sims and O'Loughlin
1989; Kaiser et al. 1996). Biodegradability of pyridine
derivatives was found generally to follow the order
pyridinecarboxylic acids > pyridine  monohydroxypyridines > methylpyridines > aminopyridines  chloropyridines (Naik et al. 1972; Sims and Sommers 1985,
1986; Sims and O'Loughlin 1989).
Pyridine
The ability to degrade pyridine is widespread in microorganisms. Hypothetical pathways for the aerobic microbial degradation of pyridine are summarized in
Fig. 1. From a number of organisms (Fig. 1A±F), only
aliphatic intermediates of pyridine degradation have
been identi®ed, and some (pyridine-induced) enzymes
converting (proposed) aliphatic intermediates detected.
However, the mechanism(s) of cleavage of the pyridine
ring remain(s) unknown (Fig. 1A± F). In earlier studies,
hydroxylated pyridine derivatives were not observed
during the transformation of pyridine. In contrast, UV
and IR spectroscopy and gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry analyses of extracts of the culture broth of
Rhodococcus opacus and Arthrobacter crystallopoietes
strains revealed the formation of a number of hydroxylated metabolites during pyridine utilization. Products
of pyridine ring cleavage were also detected, but studies
on the enzymes that would be involved in the proposed
pathways were not performed (Fig. 1G, H; Ze®rov et al.
1994).
Alkylpyridines
For 2-methylpyridine utilization by an Arthrobacter
strain, a reductive pathway involving succinic semialdehyde (cf. Fig. 1) as intermediate was suggested
(Shukla 1974, 1984). Degradation of 2- and 4-ethylpyridine by a mixed culture from soil was found to involve ring hydroxylation and reduction prior to ring
cleavage (Feng et al. 1994).

(Compounds depicted in brackets were not detected)

Hydroxypyridines
Degradation of hydroxypyridines occurs via hydroxylation of the ring yielding a di- or trihydroxypyridine
intermediate, followed by ring cleavage (cf. Fig. 1; Houghton and Cain 1972; Shukla 1984; Kaiser et al. 1996).
3,4-Dihydroxypyridine undergoes meta cleavage (2,3dioxygenolysis) in an Agrobacterium sp. (Watson et al.
1974). In Nocardia sp. strain PNO, 2-hydroxypyridine is
hydroxylated to 2,5-dihydroxypyridine (and presumably
to 2,3,6-trihydroxypyridine) prior to ring cleavage and
formation of maleamate (Shukla and Kaul 1986). 2,5Dihydroxypyridine was found to undergo 5,6-dioxygenolytic ring cleavage and subsequent hydrolysis to
maleamate and formate in Achromobacter sp. (cf. Fig. 2;
Cain et al. 1974).

Pyridine carboxylic acids
Nicotinic acid may undergo degradation via the maleamate pathway, as outlined in Fig. 2A, B. Surprisingly,
Azorhizobium caulinodans, as does Clostridium barkeri,
reduces 6-hydroxynicotinate to 6-oxo-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinate, which subsequently undergoes hydrolytic
degradation (Fig. 2C). In contrast to the fermentative
pathway (Fig. 7), the Azorhizobium pathway involves
glutaric acid as intermediate (Fig. 2C; Kitts et al. 1992).
Succinic semialdehyde (see Fig. 1) was characterized as a
key intermediate of isonicotinic acid degradation by
Bacillus brevis, and a pathway involving oxygenative
cleavage of the partially reduced pyridine ring was proposed (Singh and Shukla 1986). In contrast, Mycobacterium sp. INA1 (Kretzer et al. 1993), Pseudomonas sp.
(Ensign and Rittenberg 1965) and Micrococcus (formerly, Sarcina) sp. (Gupta and Shukla 1979)
degrade
isonicotinic acid via 2-hydroxy- and 2,6-dihydroxyisonicotinic acid. Further degradation by Mycobacterium
sp. strain INA1 involves coenzyme A activation and ring
reduction prior to ring cleavage and 2-oxoglutarate
formation (Fig. 3; Kretzer et al. 1993). Picolinic acid,
which may occur as degradation product of the herbicide
diquat, is initially hydroxylated at C-6, and there is a
second hydroxylation at C-3. Decarboxylation produces
2,5-dihydroxypyridine, which is further metabolized via
the maleamate pathway (cf. Fig. 2) in a Bacillus sp. and
in a gram-negative isolate (Shukla and Kaul 1973;
Shukla et al. 1977). Dipicolinic acid, a typical constituent
of the core of the bacterial endospore, is degraded by
Achromobacter via hydroxylation at C-3 and ring
cleavage between C-2 and C-3. Subsequent hydrolysis

241

and rearrangement reactions generate oxalate, ammonia, and 2-oxoglutarate (Kobayashi and Arima 1962).
Indole
Claus and Kutzner (1983) investigated indole catabolism
by Alcaligenes sp. strain IN3. Indole was metabolized
via isatin and anthranilate (cf. Fig. 8) to gentisate, which
was subsequently cleaved to maleylpyruvate.
Isoquinoline
Several bacterial strains utilizing isoquinoline have been
isolated. All isolates metabolized isoquinoline via
1(2H)isoquinolinone (Aislabie et al. 1989, 1994; RoÈger
et al. 1990). For Brevundimonas diminuta strain 7, a
putative degradation pathway via phthalate, 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate, and protocatechuate was suggested by
RoÈger et al. (1995) (Fig. 4).

Currently, four pathways of aerobic degradation of
quinoline (derivatives) are known, namely, the 5,6dihydroxy-2(1H)quinolinone pathway, the 7,8-dihydroxy-2(1H)quinolinone pathway, the anthranilate
pathway, and the 8-hydroxycoumarin pathway (Fig. 5;
for reviews on the pathways and on the enzymes involved, see Schwarz and Lingens 1994; Fetzner et al.
1998). In both the 5,6- and the 7,8-dihydroxy2(1H)quinolinone pathway, after initial hydroxylation
adjacent to the N-heteroatom, the benzene moiety of the
quinoline ring is transformed to a dihydroxy derivative
(5,6- or 7,8- respectively), which subsequently undergoes
ring cleavage (Fig. 5a, b). Formation and dioxygenolytic
cleavage of dihydroxy compounds is a common strategy
of aerobic bacteria to degrade aromatic compounds. In
contrast, in both the anthranilate pathway (Fig. 5c;
Hund et al. 1990; Bott et al. 1990) and the 8-hydroxycoumarin pathway (Fig. 5d; Shukla 1986, 1989; Schwarz
et al. 1989), the pyridine ring is degraded prior to benzene ring cleavage. In the anthranilate pathway of
quinaldine (Fig. 5c) and 4(1H)quinolinone degradation,
2,4-dioxygenases catalyze the cleavage of the pyridine

moiety of 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)quinolinone and 3hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolinone respectively. These dioxygenases are rather exceptional, since they catalyze the
cleavage of two carbon-carbon bonds of the respective
substrate with concomitant release of carbon monoxide
(Fig. 6; Bauer et al. 1994, 1996).

Bacterial transformation or degradation
under anoxic conditions
Anaerobiosis occurs in any habitat in which oxygen
consumption exceeds its supply. Examples include
compacted or ¯ooded soils, sediments from eutrophic
lakes, land®lls, lagoons, and some groundwater. One of
the most important anoxic habitats is the saturated
subsurface soil. Heteroaromatic compounds showing
relatively good water solubility, low sorption and thus
high aqueous mobility have often been found in subsurface environments (Table 1).

Comparison of the bacterial conversion
under nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing
and methanogenic conditions
In order to predict the fate of heterocyclic aromatic
compounds in a habitat, it is important to evaluate the
physical, chemical and physiological factors of the environment that aect the bioavailability and the metabolism of bioconversion or biodegradation, such as
temperature, pH, moisture, salinity, oxygen concentration, availability of electron donors and electron acceptors, sorption of chemicals to particulate material,
and concentration of chemicals. The availability of a
speci®c electron acceptor, for instance, may govern
biotransformation (Bollag and Kaiser 1991; Kaiser and
Bollag 1991, 1992). Under certain redox conditions,
complete mineralization of a compound may be observed, while under others transformation may be incomplete or may not occur at all.
Kuhn and Su¯ita (1989) compared the anaerobic
biodegradation of some pyridine derivatives (0.2 mM
initial concentration) by anoxic aquifer slurries incubated under sulfate-reducing or methanogenic conditions. Nicotinic acid was the most readily depleted
compound under both redox conditions, having disappeared after 1 month. Pyridine was removed after 8
months under both redox conditions, whereas 2- and 4methylpyridine disappeared only under sulfate-reducing
and methanogenic conditions, respectively. 3-Methyl-

pyridine was partially transformed in 8 months only
under sulfate-reducing conditions. Liu et al. (1994a)
evaluated the in¯uence of redox conditions on the anaerobic biotransformation of pyridine, quinoline, indole
and carbazole in anoxic freshwater sediment slurries.
Pyridine (10 mg l)1) was rapidly lost from the sediment
slurries within 4 weeks under denitrifying conditions but
persisted for up to 3 months under sulfate-reducing and
methanogenic conditions. Quinoline (10 mg l)1) was
completely transformed to 2(1H)quinolinone under
methanogenic and sulfate-reducing conditions after incubation for 23 and 45 days respectively. The hydroxylated product accumulated and was not further
transformed. (In contrast, quinoline has been shown to
be biodegraded under methanogenic conditions by
Godsy et al. 1992, 1994) Under denitrifying conditions,
less than 23% of the initial concentration of quinoline
was transformed after 83 days. Indole (10 mg l)1) was
completely removed from the sediment slurries under
methanogenic, nitrate-reducing, and sulfate-reducing
conditions after 17, 18, and 27 days respectively. Stoichiometric amounts of oxindole accumulated under
sulfate-reducing conditions, whereas under methanogenic and denitrifying conditions it was further
degraded via unknown compounds. No evidence for
anaerobic biotransformation of carbazole was noted.
Carbazole strongly sorbed to the sediments and was the
least bioavailable of the N-heterocyclic compounds investigated (Liu et al. 1994a). In another comparative
study, soil samples from a creosote-contaminated site in
Denmark were used as inoculum to examine the degradation of indole and quinoline under nitrate-reducing,
sulfate-reducing, and methanogenic conditions. Indole
and quinoline were transformed under all three redox
conditions, with highest degradation rates observed
under sulfate-reducing conditions. Maximum conversion rates were as follows: denitrifying conditions, indole
1.9 lmol l)1 day)1, quinoline 0.5 lmol l)1 day)1; methanogenic conditions, indole 6.6 lmol l)1 day)1, quinoline 1.8 lmol l)1 day)1; sulfate-reducing conditions,
indole 16.0 lmol l)1 day)1, quinoline 13.1 lmol l)1
day)1 (Licht et al. 1996). Similarly, Dyreborg et al.
(1997), investigating the potential of groundwater microorganisms to degrade some N-, S-, and O-heteroaromatic compounds, reported that quinoline was degraded
by anaerobic microcosms with degradation rates that
were slightly higher under sulfate-reducing conditions
than under denitrifying and methanogenic conditions.
Pyridine and derivatives
Pyridine
Degradation of pyridine has been observed to occur
under nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions (Kaiser and Bollag 1991, 1992;
Kuhn and Su¯ita 1989; Bak and Widdel 1986; Ronen

244

and Bollag 1991, 1992; Battersby and Wilson 1989).
Azoarcus evansii strain pF6 degrades pyridine under
both aerobic and nitrate-reducing conditions through
the same pathway (Fig. 1F; Rhee et al. 1997). Hydroxy
intermediates were not involved in this pathway. In
contrast, Kaiser and Bollag (1991) suggested that 3hydroxypyridine might be an intermediate in pyridine
degradation by mixed cultures obtained from sewage
sludge under nitrate- and sulfate-reducing conditions.
Alkylpyridines
2-, 3-, and 4-methylpyridine were utilized by various
sulfate-reducing mixed cultures (Kuhn and Su¯ita 1989;
Kaiser and Bollag 1992; Kaiser et al. 1993). 4-Methyl2(1H)pyridone was identi®ed as intermediate of 4methylpyridine degradation (Kaiser et al. 1993). Complete mineralization of 4-methylpyridine by aquifer
slurries also occurred under methanogenic conditions
(Kuhn and Su¯ita 1989).
Hydroxypyridines
2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxypyridine disappeared completely
from a sulfate-reducing mixed culture obtained from
polluted subsurface soil (Kaiser and Bollag 1992). Mixed
cultures from sewage sludge completely degraded 3-hydroxypyridine under sulfate- and nitrate-reducing conditions (Kaiser and Bollag 1991).
Pyridine carboxylic acids
Nicotinic acid was degraded in anoxic aquifer slurries
under methanogenic conditions, whereas, in this study,
pyridine was not mineralized (Adrian and Su¯ita 1994).
Nicotinic acid was degraded by sulfate-reducing and
methanogenic aquifer slurries (Kuhn and Su¯ita 1989).
The sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfococcus niacini
completely mineralizes nicotinic acid via unknown intermediates (Imho-Stuckle and Pfennig 1983). In the
fermentative pathway of nicotinic acid degradation by
Clostridium barkeri, the initial step is ring hydroxylation,
followed by a ring reduction ± ring cleavage sequence as
shown in Fig. 7 (Stadtman et al. 1972). A fermentative
bacterium in a de®ned two-membered coculture from
marine sediment degraded dipicolinate to propionate,
acetate, NH3 and CO2 (Seyfried and Schink 1990).
Indole
Complete microbial degradation of indole has frequently been observed under nitrate-reducing as well as
under sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions
(Wang et al. 1984; Berry et al. 1987b; Madsen et al.
1988; Shanker and Bollag 1990; Liu et al. 1994a; Licht
et al. 1996). The transformation pathway of indole by

pyruvic acid 8; acetic acid 9

Desulfobacterium indolicum preceeds via oxindole, isatin,
and anthranilate (Fig. 8; Johansen et al. 1997b). The
same catabolic steps were suggested for indole mineralization by a denitrifying microbial community obtained
from sewage sludge (Madsen and Bollag 1989). This
anaerobic pathway shows similarities to the early steps
of the aerobic indole catabolism described above (Claus
and Kutzner 1983).
Isoquinoline, quinoline and its derivatives
Isoquinoline and quinoline can be degraded anaerobically. Isoquinoline has been removed from municipal
sludge in a primary digester (Parker et al. 1994) and
from creosote-contaminated aquifer material and
groundwater (Godsy et al. 1992, 1994) under methanogenic conditions. Anoxic sediment slurries from both
a freshwater and an oceanic (3.7% salinity) environment
showed a complete loss of quinoline (approximately
0.2 mM) within 3 months (Liu and Kuo 1996). Quinoline completely disappeared from a mixed culture from
creosote-polluted soil under nitrate-reducing, sulfatereducing and methanogenic conditions (Licht et al.
1996). Whereas, in some studies, 2(1H)quinolinone accumulated from quinoline under sulfate-reducing and
methanogenic conditions (Pereira et al. 1988; Liu et al.
1994a), complete degradation under methanogenic
conditions was also observed (Battersby and Wilson
1989; Godsy et al. 1992, 1994; Liu et al. 1994b). Licht
et al. (1997) proposed that the sulfate-reducing bacterium D. indolicum, which is able to grow on indole and
quinoline (Bak and Widdel 1986), uses the same inducible enzyme to hydroxylate both indole and quinoline,

forming oxindole and 2(1H)quinolinone respectively.
D. indolicum, after this initial hydroxylation at position
2, forms 3,4-dihydro-2(1H)quinolinone (Fig. 9), which is
further transformed into unidenti®ed products. 6- and 8methylquinoline were converted to 6- and 8-methyl-3,4dihydro-2(1H)quinolinone in stoichiometric amounts,
whereas 3- and 4-methyl-2(1H)quinolinone were not
reduced by D. indolicum (Johansen et al. 1997b). The
degradation of quinoline in a bio®lm system under
denitrifying conditions likewise proceeded via
2(1H)quinolinone and 3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone,
which subsequently was converted to unidenti®ed compounds. 3-, 4-, 6-, and 8-methylquinoline also were hydroxylated at C-2. The hydroxylated metabolites of the
quinolines methylated at the heterocyclic ring were not
transformed further, whereas the 6- and 8-methyl2(1H)quinolinones were hydrogenated at position 3 and
4. The resulting methylated 3,4-dihydro-2(1H)quinolinones accumulated (Johansen et al. 1997c).

As a rule, sorption phenomena play an important role
in the transport of organic contaminants in sediment
and soil/water systems, and in¯uence biotic processes.
Catallo (1996) examined the transformation of N-, O-,
and S-heterocyclic compounds in estuarine sediment
water microcosms. Under continuously stirred conditions in the microcosms, degradation processes were
limited by increased particle surface area and reduced
electrochemical conditions (i.e., degradation was fastest in oxidized sediments of large particle size). In
quiescent systems, transformation rates were also
faster with increasing particle size, but were promoted
by reducing electrochemical conditions. Most biochemical and chemical transformations appeared to
occur in the aqueous phases of the sediment slurries,
rather than at the surface sites on particles. Hence,
reducing redox conditions in the unstirred systems
promoted liberation of heteroaromatic compounds
from iron colloids and particles into the aqueous
phase where chemical and microbial processes proceed
at more rapid rates. Other processes that liberate the
heteroaromatics from sediment surfaces to the aqueous
phase, such as protonation to soluble ion pairs, were
also expected to increase the degradation rates of some
heterocyclic compounds in the sediment microcosms
(Catallo 1996).
Sorption tends to decrease the degradation rate of
organic chemicals by reducing their bioavailability. On
the other hand, pollutants showing low sorption to soil
are readily leached into subsoil and groundwater. For
quinoline (pKa  4.9), a dominant role of cation exchange in partitioning between water and low-organiccarbon materials (subsoils, clay, amorphous silica) has
been suggested in several reports (Zachara et al. 1986,
1990; McBride et al. 1992; Szecsody and Streile 1992). In
the presence of clays (montmorillonite, hectorite), Smith
et al. (1992) found that microbial utilization of quinoline
was desorption-rate-limited and suggested that sorption
of the quinolinium ion (QH+) reduces its bioavailability.
However, Helmy et al. (1983) discussed the possibility
that the neutral species of quinoline in a chemisorption
mechanism replaces the surface hydroxyls bonded to
structural atoms (Al, Fe) of the clay.
In contrast to low-organic-carbon clay, where sorption is thought to occur mainly by cation exchange (and
chemisorption), the partitioning of azaarenes, such as
quinoline and acridine, between organic-rich wastewater
sludge and water appeared to be dominated by the
mechanism of hydrophobic interaction. The cationic
species (acidic pH) were less readily sorbed by the sludge
than the neutral azaarenes (Southworth and Keller
1984). Thus, the adsorption/desorption balance of
azaarenes depends on the nature of the sorbent as well as
on physicochemical conditions such as salinity and pH.

In situ transformations and bioremediation
strategies; trends and prospects
Because of the complexity of natural ecosystems, extrapolations of laboratory studies to in situ environments are very dicult, if not impossible (Mandelbaum
et al. 1997). For a compound to be degraded biologically under ®eld conditions, some basic criteria must be
met. Bioavailability of the substrate must be considered,
especially with respect to sorption phenomena and
concentration of the compound, an appropriate microbial community possessing the requisite catabolic ability
must be present, and environmental parameters must be
conducive to growth of the degrading microorganisms.
Investigating the biotransformation of pyridine derivatives under dierent redox conditions by slurries of
unpolluted as well as polluted surface and subsurface
soils, Kaiser and Bollag (1992) showed that long-term
adaptation of the indigenous micro¯ora may well be a
crucial factor for biodegradation. Concerning the presence of appropriate microbial communities, diverse and
abundant microbial populations have been found even
in deep subsurface samples (Shanker et al. 1991; Thomas et al. 1997). Aerobic microbial mineralization of
indole and pyridine occurred in sediment samples taken
from dierent depths (up to 526 m), and sulfate-reducing bacteria capable of indole transformation were
also present in several samples taken from the deep
(several hundred meters) subsurface (Shanker et al.
1991).
However, polluted ecosystems generally contain
complex mixtures of compounds, which dier in their
toxicity to microorganisms. When toxic pollutants are
present together with contaminants that, as sole substrates, are easily biodegradable, degradation of the
latter may be aected or even prevented. Typical creosote compounds, such as pyrrole, thiophene, and benzofuran, for instance, were found to inhibit the aerobic
degradation of toluene (Dyreborg et al. 1996).
Field studies by in situ monitoring of organic contaminants provide insight into the transport and fate of
the respective compound(s) in the habitat. In a longterm ®eld experiment to evaluate the mobility, persistence and fate in groundwater of compounds present in
coal tar creosote, creosote was placed into a well-characterized sand aquifer that showed mostly aerobic conditions. With increasing distance from the source of
contamination, the concentration of naphthalene was
reduced while that of quinoline increased, re¯ecting the
relative aqueous solubilities and mobilities of the two
compounds. Also observed, after 471 days at sampling
sites most distant from the source, was the presence of
quinolinone (Fowler et al. 1994).
The transport and fate of the water-soluble fraction
of creosote in a contaminated aquifer were studied
thoroughly at the American Creosote Works Superfund
site at Pensacola, Florida (see Table 1). Whereas wells
located near the source of contamination contained, for

instance, quinoline and isoquinoline as well as
2(1H)quinolinone and 1(2H)isoquinolinone, samples
from wells at more distant sites only contained the oxo
compounds. This ®nding was attributed to microbial
transformation (Pereira et al. 1987a, b). Under the predominantly anoxic conditions of the Pensacola aquifer,
removal of N-heteroaromatics appeared to occur:
25 mg l)1 quinoline and 2 mg l)1 isoquinoline were reported to disappear on a 47-m stretch between two
sampling wells downhill from the contamination source
(Grbic-Galic 1989). Godsy et al. (1992, 1994) also reported ®eld evidence for methanogenic degradation of
quinoline and isoquinoline to CH4 and CO2 in the anoxic groundwater ecosystem near Pensacola. In situ
observations like these suggest that transformations of
N-heteroaromatic compounds are indeed occurring in
subsurface environments.
Bioremediation techniques exploit the ability of
microorganisms to degrade organic substances. In situ
stimulation of the indigenous micro¯ora, in situ inoculation of specialized microbial strains, or withdrawaland-treatment techniques such as land farming, trickling
®lters or bioreactors are a few means to treat contaminated soils and aquifers. Most studies, however, have
concentrated on the removal of gasoline, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolic wastes, or chlorinated
hydrocarbons (Lee et al. 1988; Mueller et al. 1989;
Grbic-Galic 1989).
For the treatment of groundwater polluted with alkylpyridines, a two-stage ®xed-®lm reactor, using an
aerobic mixed culture enriched from subsurface sediment as inoculum, was developed. It removed alkylpyridines with an eciency of 98%±100% from a
synthetic groundwater (Ronen et al. 1996).
An integrated bioreclamation approach, including
land farming with added water and nutrients, bioreactors for heavily contaminated groundwater, irrigation of
contaminated rocks with bioreactor euent, and in situ
aquifer treatment by addition of nutrients and H2O2,
was used to remediate soil, groundwater, and aquifer
sediments contaminated with the wood preservatives
creosote and pentachlorophenol (Fredrickson et al.
1993). For bioremediation of the American Creosote
Works Superfund site at Pensacola and other creosotecontaminated sites, which all contain complex mixtures
of pollutants, multiphasic treatment strategies were developed. Soil washing technology with dewatering and
chemical fractionation of substances through a ®ltration
process, and biodegradation of targeted compounds
using patented bacteria capable of utilizing distinct
compounds as carbon and energy sources for growth
were used to treat creosote-contaminated soils and
subsoil materials (Mueller et al. 1991, 1993). To treat the
creosote-contaminated groundwater of the Pensacola
site, Mueller et al. (1993) developed a (pilot-scale) twostage, sequential inoculation, continuous-¯ow bioreactor system. A mixture of 15 selected bacterial strains that
had been isolated from creosote-contaminated soil were
used as inocula for the bioreactor. This type of biore-

247

actor system on the ®eld scale was shown to degrade
about 70% of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and
heterocycles present in the groundwater (Middaugh et
al. 1994).
Since there may be speci®c problems associated with
aerobic in situ treatment, such as biofouling or ± quite
frequently ± the impossibility of introducing sucient
oxygen (especially in aquifers with low permeabilities), it
seems important to evaluate the applicability of anaerobic transformations. Ronen and Bollag (1992) inoculated subsurface sediment from a polluted site with a
pyridine-degrading Alcaligenes sp. At high inoculum
size, pyridine was rapidly mineralized under nitrate-reducing conditions. Amending the sediment with nitrate
and phosphate improved pyridine mineralization.
It is obvious that dierent microbial communities
have dierent capabilities to convert the same substrates, and that the physicochemical properties of the
environment considerably in¯uence biotransformation
processes. Thus, for each speci®c site, both laboratory
and ®eld studies will be necessary to predict the fate of a
compound in this habitat. A thorough understanding of
microbial catabolic pathways and of the environmental
factors that in¯uence biodegradation is prerequisite for
the development of bioremediation techniques.
