The biological effects and expected fate of the vast amount of oil in the Gulf of Mexico from
the Deepwater Horizon blowout are unknown owing to the depth and magnitude of this event.
Here, we report that the dispersed hydrocarbon plume stimulated deep-sea indigenous
g-Proteobacteria that are closely related to known petroleum degraders. Hydrocarbon-degrading
genes coincided with the concentration of various oil contaminants. Changes in hydrocarbon
composition with distance from the source and incubation experiments with environmental isolates
demonstrated faster-than-expected hydrocarbon biodegradation rates at 5°C. Based on these
results, the potential exists for intrinsic bioremediation of the oil plume in the deep-water column
without substantial oxygen drawdown.
Assessing the environmental and public
health impacts of the Deepwater Horizon
blowout is difficult owing to the extreme
depth of the blowout and the large volumes of oil
released. Moreover, the effectiveness of the primary
initial mitigation strategy (e.g., injecting the
oil dispersant Corexit 9500 directly at the wellhead
in a water depth of 1544 m) is difficult to
assess despite initial analysis of its potential toxicity
(1). An optional strategy for remediation of
the deep underwater plume is to use the intrinsic
bioremediation potential of deep-sea microorganisms
to degrade the oil. This strategy depends
on a number of environmental factors, including
a favorable response of indigenous microorganisms
to an increased concentration of hydrocarbons
and/or dispersant.
To determine the impact of the deep hydrocarbon
plume on the marine microbes residing in
the plume and the rates of hydrocarbon biodegradation,
we collected deep-water samples from
two ships between 25May 2010 and 2 June 2010.
In total, we analyzed the physical, chemical, and
microbiological properties (fig. S1) of 17 deepwater
samples fromacross the Gulf ofMexico (2).

We detected a deep-sea oil plume from 1099
to 1219 m at distances of up to 10 km from the
wellhead (fig. S2). Owing to its composition
(fig. S3), the plume was likely dispersed MC252
oil, a conclusion also reached by Camilli et al.
(3). At most locations where the plume was detected,
there was a slight decrease in oxygen
concentration indicative of microbial respiration
and oxygen consumption, as would be expected
if the hydrocarbons were being catabolized (Fig. 1).
Oxygen saturation within the plume averaged
59%, while outside the plume it was 67%. Extractable
hydrocarbons (e.g., octadecane) ranged
from nondetectable in the nonplume samples to
9.21 mg/liter in plume samples (table S1). Volatile
aromatic hydrocarbons were significantly higher
in the plume interval (mean 139 mg/liter) than in
the nonplume samples from similar depths. The
average temperature within the plume interval
was 4.7°C and the pressure was 1136 dB. Soluble
orthophosphate, and total ammonia-N, were detected
at similar concentrations within and outside
the plume interval (table S1).
The dispersed oil plume affected both microbial
cell densities and composition (Fig. 1 and
table S1). Cell densities in the plume (5.51 T 0.33 ×
104 cells/ml) were higher than outside the plume
(2.73 T 0.05 × 104 cells/ml). Phospholipid fatty
acid analysis also confirmed an increase in microbial
biomass in the plume (0.57 pmol lipids/ml)
versus outside the plume (0.23 pmol lipids/ml)
(table S1). In addition to the observed increase in
cell densities, PhyloChip 16S ribosomal RNA
(rRNA) microarray analysis (fig. S4) suggests
that the plume significantly altered the microbial
community composition and structure. Ordination
of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene composition
revealed two distinct clusters of samples:
one composed entirely of plume samples with
detected oil and the other of nonplume samples
(Fig. 2). No physical or chemical factors other
than hydrocarbons and nitrates were significantly
different between these groups (table S1),
indicating that microorganisms were responding
directly to the presence of dispersed oil.
In plume samples, PhyloChip analysis revealed
that 951 distinct bacterial taxa in 62 phyla
were present (fig. S4), but only 16 distinct taxa
that were all classified as g-Proteobacteria were
significantly enriched in the plume relative to nonplume
samples (table S2 and fig. S5). Nearly all

of these enriched taxa have representatives that
degrade hydrocarbons or are stimulated by the
presence of oil in cold environments (table S2).
Plume-enriched bacteria include many psychrophilic
and psychrotolerant species that have been
observed in low-temperaturemarine environments
(table S2) (4–6). Although cell densities are higher
in the plume, taxonomic richness was lower
and the diversity of enriched bacteria was restricted
to a few g-Proteobacteria.
Cloning and sequencing revealed that deepsea
plume samples from station BM58 (~10.08 km
from the MC252 wellhead) and station OV011
(~1.5 km from the wellhead) were dominated by
the order Oceanospirillales in the g-Proteobacteria.
More than 90% of all sequences in both plume
samples (10 km between sampling stations) belonged
to a single operational taxonomic unit
(OTU) that is most closely related to Oceanospirillales
(Fig. 3). In a control sample (site OV003)
collected 39.1 km southwest of the wellhead, this
same OTU represented only 5% of all sequences
analyzed (Fig. 3). In addition, this taxon was
detected in all 10 oil plume samples analyzed by
the PhyloChip and was significantly enriched
relative to background deep seawater with no oil
(table S1). The cultured representatives most closely
related to the OTU in plume samples were
Spongiispira norvegica (95% similar) and Oceaniserpentilla
haliotidis (94% similar). The observed
sequences in the plume samples form a clade with
two distinct Oceanospirillales groups. One of these
groups is largely composed of known psychrophilic
hydrocarbon degraders and microorganisms from
hydrocarbon-dominated environments (5, 7, 8),
including Oleispira antarctica, Thalassolituus
oleivorans, and Oleiphilus messinensis (fig. S5).
The three dominant phospholipid fatty acids
detected in the plume samples were C16:0,

C16:1w7c, and C18:1w9c (table S3), which have
been reported as the dominant lipids in the
Oleispirea antarctica, in some strains of the
Oceaniserpentilla haliotis (4), and in a consortium
of marine hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria
(9). 18:1w9t/c ratios that have been reported to
increase in oil-contaminated environments (10, 11)
were slightly elevated in plume samples (average
0.21) compared to nonplume samples (average
0.14) but were not strongly correlated with oil
concentrations (table S1). Multivariate analysis
of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles from
each sample revealed distinct clustering of plume
and nonplume samples similar to community
analysis of microarray data (Fig. 2).
Microscopic examination of cells collected
within the plume also revealed that the dominant
cell type exhibits a distinctive morphology typical
of the Oceanospirillales (Fig. 4). Total bacterial
densities were also significantly correlated
with MC252 alkane concentration in the plume
(fig. S5). Synchrotron radiation–based Fouriertransform
infrared (SR-FTIR) spectromicroscopy
revealed absorptions at ~1730, ~1610, and ~1150
cm−1 that are associated with biomolecule-rich
regions of a cellular floc (Fig. 3). These absorption
features arewell described for the carbonyl (C=O),
nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides vibrationmodes
(12) and are characteristic of oil degradation
products (13). These SR-FTIR spectra are not
consistent with those typically found in marine
macroaggregates (14), nor are they consistent with
nonplume samples at the same depth.
To understand the distribution of oil-degrading
genes within the plume, we analyzed five samples
(BM053, BM054, BM057, BM058, BM064)
from the MC252 dispersed oil plume as well as
five uncontaminated, control samples (OV003,
OV004, OV009, OV013 and OV014) collected
from plume depth with GeoChip functional array
(table S4) (15, 16). Altogether, 4000 to 5000 functional
genes were detected per sample, among
which 1652 genes are involved in hydrocarbon
degradation. Detrended correspondence analysis
showed that microbial community functional composition
and structure were considerably different
between oil-plume and nonplume control samples
(fig. S7), which is consistent with PhyloChip analysis.
Many of the genes involved in hydrocarbon
degradation were significantly (P < 0.05 or 0.01)
increased in oil plume samples (figs. S8 and S9).
Statistical analysis by Mantel test showed that
the overall microbial functional composition and
structure were significantly correlated with many
key oil contaminants, including isopropylbenzene,
n-propylbenzene, tert-butylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene,
p-isopropyltoluene, n-butylbenzene,
and naphthalene (table S5). Analysis based on
individual genes showed that the changes of
many hydrocarbon degradation genes are significantly
correlated with the concentrations of oil
contaminants (table S6). For instance, the phdCI
gene encoding carboxylate isomerase for naphthalene
degradation correlates with several hydrocarbons
(table S6). These results indicated that a
variety of hydrocarbon-degrading populations exist
in the deep-sea plume and that the microbial communities
appear to be undergoing rapid dynamic
adaptation in response to oil contamination. These
results also imply that there exists a potential for
intrinsic bioremediation of oil contaminants in the
deep sea and that oil-degrading communities could
play an important role in controlling the ultimate
fates of hydrocarbons in the Gulf.
The bioremediation potential largely depends
on the rates of biodegradation in the plume. We
calculated maximum biodegradation rates using
two data sets from the field and two from
laboratory microcosms representing concentrations
of C13 to C26 n-alkanes (table S7). The
degradation rate coefficients and half-life values
(table S7 and figs. S10 and S11), calculated from
the alkane data from these four sources with the
first-order rate equation (10, 17), are similar to
those reported for comparable temperature and
field conditions (10, 17–19). Despite the varying
field and microcosm conditions, the oil half-lives
are 1.2 to 6.1 days (table S7). The field half-lives
should in part reflect the effect of mixing and
dilution, but the similarity of the rate of disappearance
of alkanes in the plume to the rates
observed in the laboratory suggest it is possible
that the actual degradation of alkanes lies within
this range. The possibility that biodegradation
largely controls the disappearance of alkanes is
also supported by the preferential degradation of
short-chain alkanes, as represented in the increase
in the ratio of C26/C15 alkanes over 10 km, from
less than 1 tomore than 3 (fig. S18). For each data
set, decay constants were similar for all alkanes
measured in all samples, with the exception of the
plume samples from the nonlipid fraction collected
on 0.2-mm filters. Because these results
represent extraction from free-phase oil or oil
absorbed to the membrane filter, it is likely that
the higher rates seen for the shorter-chain alkanes
are due to additional losses in collected sample
resulting from dissolution into seawater; however,
there is a correlation of longer-chain alkane concentration
with cell densities in the plume (fig.
S6). The oil biodegradation rates reported here at
5°C are explained partly by the relatively light
nature of this crude (which contains a large volatile
component that is more readily degraded),
the dispersed nature of the deep plume (small oil
particle size), the low overall concentrations of
oil in the deep plume, and the frequent episodic
oil leaks from natural seeps in this area that the
deep-sea microbial community may have adapted
to over long periods of time.

Propane Respiration Jump-Starts
Microbial Response to a Deep Oil Spill

The Deepwater Horizon event resulted in suspension of oil in the Gulf of Mexico water column
because the leakage occurred at great depth. The distribution and fate of other abundant
hydrocarbon constituents, such as natural gases, are also important in determining the impact
of the leakage but are not yet well understood. From 11 to 21 June 2010, we investigated dissolved
hydrocarbon gases at depth using chemical and isotopic surveys and on-site biodegradation
studies. Propane and ethane were the primary drivers of microbial respiration, accounting for up
to 70% of the observed oxygen depletion in fresh plumes. Propane and ethane trapped in the
deep water may therefore promote rapid hydrocarbon respiration by low-diversity bacterial blooms,
priming bacterial populations for degradation of other hydrocarbons in the aging plume.
The oil leakage following the sinking of the
Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf ofMexico
was unprecedented because it occurred at
1.5-km water depth. The slow buoyant migration
of petroleum from this depth allows time for dissolution
of volatile hydrocarbons (1–3), including
the natural gases methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6),
propane (C3H8), and butane (C4H10), that would
readily escape to the atmosphere if released in
shallow water. The resulting plumes of dissolved
gas may co-occur with oil in the water (3) or may
occur without oil because of gas fractionation
processes during ascent (4). Based on the cumulative
discharge estimates through 1 August 2010
(5) and a gas-to-oil ratio of 3000 ft3 barrel–1 (at atmospheric
pressure), 1.5 × 1010 moles of natural
gas were potentially emitted to the deep water
over the course of the spill, in addition to the oil
(6). We investigated the distribution, fate, and
impacts of these hydrocarbons at 31 stations located
1 to 12.5 km from the active spill site (Fig.
1A) during the PLUMES (Persistent and Localized
Underwater Methane Emission Study)
expedition of the research vessel Cape Hatteras,
11 to 21 June 2010 (6).
In the vicinity of the leaking well, propane,
ethane, and methaneweremost abundant at depths
greater than 799 m and formed plume structures
(Fig. 1C and figs. S1 to S3) with dissolved concentrations
as high as 8 mM, 16 mM, and 180 mM
for the three gases, respectively. These gases were
orders of magnitude less concentrated at shallower
depths, confirming suggestions (7), results from
a noncalibrated spectrometric survey (3), and
models (1, 2) that the majority of the emanated
gas dissolves or is otherwise partitioned (e.g., as
gas hydrate) at depth and remains there. We
defined a hydrocarbon plume by a methane concentration
>500 nM, which is roughly 20 to 50
times as high as background levels of methane
in the Gulf of Mexico (8) and is above the methane
levels typically found around natural seeps
(9–13).We observed deep (>799 m) hydrocarbon
plumes at 29 of the 31 stations where methane
measurements were made. One persistent plume
at 1000- to 1200-m depth located to the southwest
of the spill site (Fig. 1C) was identified previously
(3, 14–16). We also identified separate
plumes at similar depths to the north and to the
east, as well as a distinctive shallower plume at
800- to 1000-m depth also located to the east
(figs. S2 and S3). The multiple plumes in opposing
directions presumably originated at different
times and indicate complex current patterns in the
area before sampling.
The ratio of methane to ethane and propane
varied substantially throughout the deep plumes.
At the locations with highest hydrocarbon concentrations,
the lower end-member values approached
10.85 for CH4/C2H6 (Fig. 2A) and 19.8
for CH4/C3H8 (Fig. 2B) and could therefore represent
the gas ratios at the plume origin. Numerous
locations display higher ratios, whichwe interpret
as preferential loss of propane and ethane relative
to methane, a pattern reported previously for biodegradation
in hydrocarbon seeps (17). Variation
in the C2H6/C3H8 ratio (Fig. 2C) further suggests
preferential loss of propane compared with ethane,
also an established biodegradation pattern
(17). Methane’s conservative behavior is supported
by generally slow rates of oxidation, as measured
with a tritium tracer approach (table S1).
Because bacterial propane, ethane, and methane
consumption occurs with characteristic kinetic
isotope effects (17), we measured the carbon
isotopic composition of these gases in deep plume
waters to assess the extent of their biodegradation.
Sampleswith CH4/C3H8 > 19.8 displayed a relative
13C-enrichment in propane.Comparison of the 13Cpropane
enrichment to the fractional loss of propane
(Fig. 2D), determined from the CH4/C3H8 ratio,
indicates that biodegradation occurs (18, 19) with
an isotopic enrichment factor (e) of –6.3. The value
of e for ethane (–11.8) based on CH4/C2H6 ratios
also suggests that biodegradation is occurring.
Both values are similar to the minimum respective
values of –5.9 and –11.2 determined from a previous
mesocosm study (17). A lack of notable 13C
enrichment for methane [d13C-CH4 = –61.1 T
2.2‰ (per mil); n = 18] is further evidence of its
conservative behavior in the fresh plumes.
To assess the importance of ethane and propane
as aerobic respiratory substrates, we compared
their loss patterns with observed oxygen
anomalies in the deep-water column (Fig. 1B).
Oxygen levels, measured in situ with an oxygen
sensor and confirmed onboard ship through
Winkler titrations, systematically declined in the
plume horizon (Fig. 1D and fig. S4). Regression
of the observed oxygen anomaly against the propane
anomaly (6) indicates that 58% of the oxygen
anomaly can be linked to propane (Fig. 3A).
