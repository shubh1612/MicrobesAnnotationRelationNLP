Abstract
The Deepwater Horizon event resulted in suspension of oil in the Gulf of Mexico water column because the leakage occurred at great depth. The distribution and fate of other abundant hydrocarbon constituents, such as natural gases, are also important in determining the impact of the leakage but are not yet well understood. From 11 to 21 June 2010, we investigated dissolved hydrocarbon gases at depth using chemical and isotopic surveys and on-site biodegradation studies. Propane and ethane were the primary drivers of microbial respiration, accounting for up to 70% of the observed oxygen depletion in fresh plumes. Propane and ethane trapped in the deep water may therefore promote rapid hydrocarbon respiration by low-diversity bacterial blooms, priming bacterial populations for degradation of other hydrocarbons in the aging plume.
The oil leakage following the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico was unprecedented because it occurred at 1.5-km water depth. The slow buoyant migration of petroleum from this depth allows time for dissolution of volatile hydrocarbons (1–3), including the natural gases methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), and butane (C4H10), that would readily escape to the atmosphere if released in shallow water. The resulting plumes of dissolved gas may co-occur with oil in the water (3) or may occur without oil because of gas fractionation processes during ascent (4). Based on the cumulative discharge estimates through 1 August 2010 (5) and a gas-to-oil ratio of 3000 ft3 barrel–1 (at atmospheric pressure), 1.5 × 1010 moles of natural gas were potentially emitted to the deep water over the course of the spill, in addition to the oil (6). We investigated the distribution, fate, and impacts of these hydrocarbons at 31 stations located 1 to 12.5 km from the active spill site (Fig. 1A) during the PLUMES (Persistent and Localized Underwater Methane Emission Study) expedition of the research vessel Cape Hatteras, 11 to 21 June 2010 (6).

In the vicinity of the leaking well, propane, ethane, and methane were most abundant at depths greater than 799 m and formed plume structures (Fig. 1C and figs. S1 to S3) with dissolved concentrations as high as 8 μM, 16 μM, and 180 μM for the three gases, respectively. These gases were orders of magnitude less concentrated at shallower depths, confirming suggestions (7), results from a noncalibrated spectrometric survey (3), and models (1, 2) that the majority of the emanated gas dissolves or is otherwise partitioned (e.g., as gas hydrate) at depth and remains there. We defined a hydrocarbon plume by a methane concentration >500 nM, which is roughly 20 to 50 times as high as background levels of methane in the Gulf of Mexico (8) and is above the methane levels typically found around natural seeps (9–13). We observed deep (>799 m) hydrocarbon plumes at 29 of the 31 stations where methane measurements were made. One persistent plume at 1000- to 1200-m depth located to the southwest of the spill site (Fig. 1C) was identified previously (3, 14–16). We also identified separate plumes at similar depths to the north and to the east, as well as a distinctive shallower plume at 800- to 1000-m depth also located to the east (figs. S2 and S3). The multiple plumes in opposing directions presumably originated at different times and indicate complex current patterns in the area before sampling.

The ratio of methane to ethane and propane varied substantially throughout the deep plumes. At the locations with highest hydrocarbon concentrations, the lower end-member values approached 10.85 for CH4/C2H6 (Fig. 2A) and 19.8 for CH4/C3H8 (Fig. 2B) and could therefore represent the gas ratios at the plume origin. Numerous locations display higher ratios, which we interpret as preferential loss of propane and ethane relative to methane, a pattern reported previously for biodegradation in hydrocarbon seeps (17). Variation in the C2H6/C3H8 ratio (Fig. 2C) further suggests preferential loss of propane compared with ethane, also an established biodegradation pattern (17). Methane’s conservative behavior is supported by generally slow rates of oxidation, as measured with a tritium tracer approach (table S1).

Because bacterial propane, ethane, and methane consumption occurs with characteristic kinetic isotope effects (17), we measured the carbon isotopic composition of these gases in deep plume waters to assess the extent of their biodegradation. Samples with CH4/C3H8 > 19.8 displayed a relative 13C-enrichment in propane. Comparison of the 13C-propane enrichment to the fractional loss of propane (Fig. 2D), determined from the CH4/C3H8 ratio, indicates that biodegradation occurs (18, 19) with an isotopic enrichment factor (ε) of –6.3. The value of ε for ethane (–11.8) based on CH4/C2H6 ratios also suggests that biodegradation is occurring. Both values are similar to the minimum respective values of –5.9 and –11.2 determined from a previous mesocosm study (17). A lack of notable 13C enrichment for methane [δ13C-CH4 = –61.1 ± 2.2‰ (per mil); n = 18] is further evidence of its conservative behavior in the fresh plumes.

To assess the importance of ethane and propane as aerobic respiratory substrates, we compared their loss patterns with observed oxygen anomalies in the deep-water column (Fig. 1B). Oxygen levels, measured in situ with an oxygen sensor and confirmed onboard ship through Winkler titrations, systematically declined in the plume horizon (Fig. 1D and fig. S4). Regression of the observed oxygen anomaly against the propane anomaly (6) indicates that 58% of the oxygen anomaly can be linked to propane (Fig. 3A). A similar analysis for propane plus ethane indicates that 70% of the oxygen anomaly can be linked to respiration of these two gases together (Fig. 3A). Therefore, ethane and propane are dominant respiratory substrates during the early development of deep-water hydrocarbon plumes. This relationship may break down as plumes mature because propane and ethane are removed before methane (Fig. 2, A and B) and likely before less soluble n-alkanes greater than five carbons in length. Once ethane and propane have been consumed, respiration rates are expected to drop; such a drop, when combined with mixing, could account for the weak respiration signal (<0.8 μM d–1) reported for the more distal southwest plume horizon by other investigators (3). The residual oxygen anomaly not accounted for by propane and ethane respiration (~30% plus a biomass correction) presumably derives from other hydrocarbons. Butane, which is also readily biodegraded (17, 20), is likely a substantial contributor, as it constituted at least 0.75% of the dissolved gas in the freshest plume samples but was low in concentration in more biodegraded samples (table S1).

We investigated the bacterial capacity for propane and ethane biodegradation by adding 13C-labeled substrate into freshly collected plume waters and monitoring label conversion to 13C-CO2. Time series measurements conducted at station H1 (Fig. 2, E and F) reveal an initial stage when product accumulates at a constant rate (Fig. 2F), followed by a marked increase after 24 hours (Fig. 2E). We interpret the initial rate as the maximum potential rate of biodegradation by the basal population, with saturation of the population’s enzymatic capacity leading to zero-order kinetic behavior. The later increase then indicates a growth or biosynthetic response by the microbial community to the elevated substrate level. This interpretation is supported by the observation that zero-order kinetic behavior occurs at high levels of added label, while higher-order kinetic behavior seems to result from addition of smaller quantities of labeled substrate (fig. S5). Samples treated with mercuric chloride showed no appreciable production of 13C-CO2, further confirming the biological nature of ethane and propane oxidation.

Variations in consumption of propane and methane by the developing microbial community were assessed for different oxygen anomalies using 13C and 3H tracers, respectively. In all cases, fresh duplicate plume samples were incubated in the dark near in situ temperature with tracer for 24 hours. In methane measurements, 3H-CH4 tracer levels were <2% of ambient methane, allowing for a direct calculation of methane oxidation (13). In propane measurements, the lower sensitivity for stable isotope analyses necessitated addition of large quantities of tracer, increasing total propane concentration substantially over ambient levels. We consider only those propane tracer experiments (n = 14) in which the addition was >4 times the ambient level and consider the resulting rates from 24-hour incubations to represent the maximum propane-oxidizing potential for the basal population (fig. S5). Propane-oxidizing potentials were greater at locations with higher propane anomalies (Fig. 4A), suggesting a priming effect wherein environmental exposure to propane induces increased propane-respiration capacity. In comparison, methane oxidation rates were generally low in the plume horizon, with a median value of just 10 nM d–1 (n = 25), 1 to 2 orders of magnitude too low to account for the oxygen anomalies. The plume at station H28 displayed an anomalously high methane oxidation rate of 820 nM d–1, with cumulative methane consumption weakly supported by this location having the most 13C-enriched methane (δ13C-CH4 of –58.5 ± 0.8‰; n = 3) compared with all other locations sampled (δ13C-CH4 = –61.3 ± 2.2‰; n = 17). A paucity of ethane and propane at this location suggests extensive biodegradation, and comparison of methane oxidation rates to CH4/C2H6 for all rate measurements reveals a positive exponential correlation (Fig. 4B). We interpret this relationship to reflect a slower substrate response and growth rate for methanotrophs relative to ethane degraders in the plume, although direct inhibition cannot be excluded. We suggest that the development of methanotrophic communities in deep hydrocarbon plumes is delayed with respect to that of ethane-, propane-, and butane-consuming communities.

To identify potential propane- and ethane-consuming bacteria active in the deep plumes, we collected cells and sequenced bacterial DNA from five locations containing distinctive propane and ethane anomalies. A cloning-based survey of the 16S rRNA gene was dominated by several sequences related to known hydrocarbon degraders—Cycloclasticus (21–24), Colwellia (25), and members of the Oceanospirillaceae (26)—indicating a low diversity bloom of hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria in the deep plumes. The plume closest to the wellhead had the highest levels of hydrocarbons and the least evidence for biodegradation and yielded the lowest proportion of putative hydrocarbon degraders (52%) relative to typical mesopelagic bacteria. We take this location to represent an early developmental stage in the bloom of hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria. The remaining four locations were each dominated by two clades of putative hydrocarbon degraders (Fig. 3B) related to Cycloclasticus and Colwellia, contrasting previous results (16) that found relatives of the Oceanospirillaceae as the dominant phylotypes. We suggest that the observed relatives of Cycloclasticus and/or Colwellia are blooming as a result of their capacity to consume propane, ethane, and potentially butane, although not at the exclusion of other bacteria or metabolisms. While Cycloclasticus is known for its ability to degrade aromatic compounds, sequences observed here are 90% similar to putative ethane and propane oxidizers identified by stable isotope probing (27), indicating the capability in this evolutionary lineage (Fig. 3C).

The extent to which various hydrocarbons may feed respiration and bacterial blooms depends on their concentration and bioavailability. Based on several assumptions (6), we calculate that methane, ethane, and propane released from the Deepwater Horizon leak will exert a biological oxygen demand in the deep plume horizon of up to 8.3 × 1011 g O2 for methane respiration, 1.3 × 1011 g O2 for ethane, and 1.0 × 1011 g O2 for propane. In comparison, assuming that 968,000 barrels of oil were dispersed into the subsurface (5, 6), we calculate a maximum biological oxygen demand for oil of 4.4 × 1011 g O2. The sum of these values, ~1.5 × 1012 g of O2, provides an estimate of the maximum integrated deep-water O2 anomaly expected from this event, with roughly 15% of the oxygen loss occurring in fresh plumes from respiration of propane and ethane. From these estimates, we predict that roughly two-thirds of the ultimate microbial productivity in deep plumes will arise from metabolism of natural gas. We also predict boom-and-bust cycles of bacterial succession beginning with propane, ethane, and butane consumers, followed by the consumers of various higher hydrocarbons and methane. However, the plumes’ bacterial population will also respond to persistent mixing of bacteria, oxygen, and hydrocarbons with nonplume waters, which could presumably lead to attenuation in the aging plumes.
