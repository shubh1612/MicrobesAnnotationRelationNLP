Aims: To study the comparative effect of diesel addition and simulated bioremediation on the
microbial community in three different soil types.
Methods and Results: Three different soils were amended with diesel and bioremediation
treatment simulated by addition of nutrients. The progress of bioremediation, and the effect on
the indigenous microbial communities, was monitored using microbiological techniques. These
included basal respiration, sole carbon source utilization patterns using both a commerciallyavailable substrate set and a set designed to highlight changes in hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria,
and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) pro®ling. The development of active hydrocarbondegrading communities was indicated by the disappearance of diesel, increases in soil
respiration and biomass, and large changes in the sole carbon source utilization patterns and
PLFA pro®les compared with control soils. However, comparison of the relative community
structure of the three soils using PLFA pro®ling showed that there was no tendency for the
community structure of the three different soil types to converge as a result of contamination.
In fact, they became more dissimilar as a result. Changes in the sole carbon source utilization
patterns using the commercially-available set of carbon sources indicated the same result as
shown by PLFA pro®ling. The specially selected set of carbon sources yielded no additional
information compared with the commercially-available set.
Conclusions: Diesel contamination does not result in the development of similar community
pro®les in different soil types.
Signi®cance and Impact of the Study: The results suggest that different soils have different
inherent microbial potential to degrade hydrocarbons, a ®nding that should be taken into
account in impact and risk assessments. Following the development of the microbial
community and its recovery is a useful and sensitive way of monitoring the impact and recovery
of oil-contaminated soils.
INTRODUCTION
Contamination of soil by oil spills is a widespread environmental problem that often requires clean-up of the
contaminated site (Whittaker et al. 1995). Bioremediation,
the removal of hydrocarbons through microbial degradation,
is a commonly used approach for decontaminating oilCorrespondence to: J.G. Bundy, Imperial College of Science, Technology

polluted soils. It has often been recorded that the addition of
hydrocarbon-degrading microbes is no more effective at
hydrocarbon removal than is stimulating the growth of the
indigenous microbiota (Atlas and Atlas 1991; Atlas and
Cerniglia 1995), and may even be less effective (Radwan
et al. 1997). Consequently, understanding the microbial
ecology and the constraints on biodegradation of an oilcontaminated site is extremely important (Holden and
Firestone 1997). A central question is therefore what is the
impact of oil pollution on microbial populations?
Contamination by oil is generally expected to reduce the
biodiversity of the soil microbiota (Atlas et al. 1991).

EFFECTS OF DIESEL ON SOIL COMMUNITIES

A probable explanation for this is that the addition of
large amounts of hydrocarbons selects for a limited
number of fast-growing hydrocarbon degraders, which
are enriched in the (typically oligotrophic) soil environment under these conditions. However, there is a lack of
information on how this may be modulated by differing
complex environmental matrices, and in particular, how
different soil types may affect the development of
hydrocarbon-degrading populations. Previous microcosm
studies examining the effect of oil contamination on soil
microbial communities have focused on a single soil type
(e.g. Engelen et al. 1998; Macnaughton et al. 1999).
WuÈnsche et al. (1995) compared hydrocarbon contamination in two different soil types. However, as one was an
historically contaminated re®nery soil and one was a
contaminated pristine arable soil, it was not possible to
separate the effects of soil type and differing oil
treatment. It has been shown that even a simple measure
of microbial response to oil contamination, such as a
toxicity bioassay, gives different responses in different soil
types (Marwood et al. 1998) and hence, it is important to
determine how soil type affects community-level response.
Three different soils were chosen to represent three
different environmental matrices and initial microbial
communities. The soils were all of similar texture (sandy
loam or loamy sand) and pH, so there were no gross effects
caused by large differences in particle size distribution or
pH. Two community-level techniques were selected to
monitor the progress of bioremediation. Biolog plates are
designed for identi®cation of isolates of bacteria of clinical
importance. Each well of a microtitre plate contains a
different carbon source, together with a redox dye for
indicating bacterial activity. A bacterial suspension is
inoculated into every well on the plate, incubated, and the
absorbance in each well read, giving a metabolic pro®le of
the organism under test (Bochner 1989). Biolog plates were
®rst employed to produce community-level physiological
pro®les (CLPPs) by Garland and Mills (1991), who
inoculated an entire bacterial community, rather than single
isolates, and analysed the resulting data using multivariate
methods. Sole carbon source utilization pro®ling of microbial communities using the Biolog system is likely to be
particularly sensitive to changes caused by addition of
carbon, such as diesel oil, as this will result in the
enrichment of fast-growing culturable bacteria (KozdroÂj
and Van Elsas 2000). In addition to the standard GN plates,
a set of carbon sources relevant to hydrocarbon degradation
was used in order to determine whether this would improve
the sensitivity or selectivity of the sole carbon source
utilization pro®ling. Previous work has shown that addition
of ecologically-relevant carbon sources to Biolog GN
sources can improve the discrimination between microbial
communities (Campbell et al. 1997). Secondly, phospholi-

277

pid fatty acid (PLFA) pro®ling of the microbial community
using phospholipids extracted directly from the soil is a well
characterized technique for providing information on the
microbial community structure that is not based on
culturing of microbes (Tunlid and White 1992; Zelles
1999).
The aim of the experiment was to test the hypothesis that
diesel contamination would alter the microbial community
of three different soils, such that they would become more
similar by selecting for a limited community of fast-growing
hydrocarbon degraders. A secondary hypothesis was that
sole carbon source utilization pro®ling using Biolog plates
would be particularly sensitive to oil contamination, and that
the use of ecologically-relevant carbon sources would
improve the performance of the Biolog approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental design
Approximately 60 g wet weight of soil was placed without
packing into a 250 ml soil jar and the jar sealed with
stretched Para®lm. The jars were incubated at 25°C in the
dark. Triplicate microcosms were destructively sampled at
each time point. There were four sampling dates, hence
72 microcosms in total were used. Microcosms were
arranged in a random order, and rearranged every 2±3 weeks
throughout the duration of the experiment. Sampling dates
were after 1, 27, 62 and 103 days. Upon sampling, the soil
within each jar was mixed and portions of soil were then
used for: Biolog CLPP (10 g soil), PLFA analysis (10 g),
respiration and water content (20 g), pH (5 g), and TPH
(total petroleum hydrocarbons; 10 g).
Diesel and soil properties
Standard commercial-grade diesel was purchased from a
local supplier and used without modi®cation. All soil
samples were taken from grassland sites with no known
history of petroleum product contamination. A single large
core was collected for each soil type from the A horizon, not
including the surface litter layer. Field-moist soil was sieved
to a diameter of 5 mm through a stainless steel sieve and
stored at 4°C until use. Soils and soil characteristics are
listed in Table 1 and were measured using standard
techniques.
Spiking and nutrient addition
Moist soil, at approximately 40% of water holding capacity
(WHC), was contaminated by manual mixing with the
diesel. The soil was spread evenly and thinly in a large glass
dish; the oil was poured evenly over the surface, then mixed

with a stainless steel spatula for 5 min. Oil was added at a
level of 20 g kg±1 dry weight of soil (2%). This is of a similar
level to concentrations used in many microcosm studies
(e.g. WuÈnsche et al. 1995), and it is common for authentically-contaminated soils to have similar or higher oil
concentrations (e.g. Saterbak et al. 1999). Nutrient solution
was then poured evenly over the soil; additional water was
added to bring the ®nal moisture content of each soil to 55%
of WHC. The soil was then mixed for a further 5 min. The
nutrient solution contained NH4NO3 as the nitrogen source
and phosphorus as a K2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer solution with
a pH of 6á4. The ®nal solution contained 28á0 g N l±1 and
3á10 g P l±1, resulting in a ®nal oil : N : P ratio of
100 : 10 : 1 (approximate C : N : P ratio 100 : 12 : 1á25).
These are typical values for nutrient-amended bioremediation (Crawford and Crawford 1999).
Respiration
Soil respiration was measured by monitoring CO2 evolution
over a 6 h period using a GC equipped with a packed
column and thermal conductivity detector (Perkin Elmer,
Beacons®eld, UK). Respiration was expressed as evolved
CO2 in units of nmol h±1 g±1 (soil dry weight basis; see BaÊaÊth
et al. (1998) for full details).
Commuity-level physiological pro®ling
Standard Biolog GN plates were used (Biolog Inc.,
Hayward, CA, US). A specially-selected set of carbon
sources was also tested using MT plates which contain redox
dye and micronutrients but no carbon source. Carboxylic
acids rather than hydrocarbons were chosen as additional
carbon sources because they are less volatile and more watersoluble than the parent hydrocarbons. MT plates were made
up containing the following carbon sources: caproic acid,
capric acid, myristic acid, stearic acid, behenic acid, benzoic
acid, salicylic acid, protocatechuic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic
acid, 4-toluic acid, 1-naphthoic acid, 2-naphthoic acid,
2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene, 1,10-dicarboxylic acid decane,
cyclohexane carboxylic acid, ()2-ethylhexanoic acid, sodium
caprylate, sodium laurate and sodium salicylate. Glucose was
also included as a positive control. Compounds were made

up as 15 mmol l±1 solutions in either ethanol or 70% ethanol.
A 3 lg aliquot of compound was added to a well. The plates
were then left to dry in a sterile environment, and stored at
4°C until use. Each plate contained four ´ (20 substrates + four blank wells), i.e. four replicates per MT plate.
Inoculating plates
Extraction of soil bacteria was based upon published
procedures which have been shown to be effective (Faegri
et al. 1977; BaÊaÊth 1992). A 10 g soil sample (wet weight)
was added to 100 ml deionized water in 250 ml conical
¯asks and shaken for 10 min on a wrist-action shaker.
Two tenfold serial dilutions were then made (5 ml+
45 ml) of the aqueous extract. The second dilution
(50 ml; 10±4 concentration) was then centrifuged at
100 g for 10 min. This low-speed centrifugation was
recommended by Riis et al. (1998), who compared
different methods of extracting micro-organisms from
soil. The supernatant ¯uid (150 ll) was added to each
well of a Biolog GN and MT plate. Absorbance of the
wells at 590 nm was read using an automated plate reader
(VMAX Molecular Devices, Crawley, UK). The plates
were then sealed inside a plastic bag, incubated at 25°C in
the dark, and read every 24 h over a period of 7 days.
The 0 h data were subtracted from each subsequent time
point in order to remove the background absorbance of
the soil extract plus carbon source; the background was
particularly high for the MT carbon sources. The average
absorbance (average well colour development, AWCD)
was then calculated for each plate and plotted against time
to give AWCD curves. The incubation time data with
AWCD closest to 1á00 were chosen for ®nal data analysis,
and normalized by dividing the absorbance of each well
on a plate by the AWCD of that plate. The values for
wells with no C source were removed and the data
analysed by principal components analysis (PCA) using
the covariance matrix.
PLFA analysis
Soil samples (approximately 10 g wet weight) were frozen
and stored at ±20°C. All samples were then analysed

EFFECTS OF DIESEL ON SOIL COMMUNITIES

TPH determination
Approximately 10 g soil (wet weight) were ground over
anhydrous Na2SO4 using a mortar and pestle until the soil
¯owed freely. The sample was transferred to a 250 ml
conical ¯ask equipped with a PTFE-lined screw cap, and an
internal standard (squalane) was added. Extraction was by
sonication in 50 ml DCM for 10 min; the extract was then
®ltered (Whatman no. 4). The extraction was repeated with
25 ml DCM, ®ltered, and the two extracts combined. A 5 ml
sample of extract was stored at ±20°C in a foil-capped
scintillation vial; the remainder was evaporated under
nitrogen at 40°C to a volume of 1 ml. The extract was then
Ê,
cleaned by liquid chromatography over 2 g silica (60 A
< 200 lm) pre-conditioned with 10 ml DCM. The sample
was loaded onto the column and eluted with 2 ´ 10 ml
DCM. TPH was then measured by GC-FID. A 1 ll volume
of extract was injected using a Fisons AS800 autosampler
(ThermoQuest Ltd, Wythenshawe, UK) onto a Carlo-Erba
8000 series GC (ThermoQuest Ltd) equipped with a
Phenomenex ZB-1 capillary column (30 m ´ 0á32 mm,
d  0á5 lm) (Phenomenex, Maccles®eld, UK), split injector
with a split ratio of 20 : 1, and ¯ame ionization detector. GC
conditions were as follows. Column gas ¯ow (N2):
1 ml min±1; split ¯ow: 20 ml min±1; injector temperature:
250°C; detector temperature: 320°C. The temperature
programme used was 80°C, held for 2 min, then increased
at 10°C min±1 to 320°C and held for 10 min.
Data analysis
Data (total PLFAs, respiration, TPH) were analysed for
statistically signi®cant differences using two-way ANOVA
in randomized blocks, considering sample date and soil type
as treatments, and experimental replication as blocking
structure. Principal components analysis (PCA) was carried
out for both PLFA and Biolog pro®les on normalized data,
i.e. data expressed as a percentage of the average value of the
set. Further details of manipulation of data from sole carbon
source utilization tests prior to PCA are given above.

RESULTS
Hydrocarbon removal
Diesel was readily degraded in all three soils, with around
60% having been removed by day 103 (Fig. 1). Biodegradation and abiotic losses were not discriminated. There were
no signi®cant differences in the total amount of diesel
removed by the end of the experiment, but the initial rate of
loss in the Boyndie soil (BY) was slower than for the other
two soil types.
Respiration and biomass
Changes in microbial parameters con®rmed that biodegradation was taking place. Respiration increased after addition
of diesel for all three soils (Fig. 2). Maximum respiration for
both Insch (IN) and Countesswells (CW) diesel-contaminated soil had occurred by day 27, and had decreased to
control or near-control levels by the end of the experiment.
The maximum respiration for BY was observed on day 62,
and was still signi®cantly elevated over control levels by the
end of the experiment. All three uncontaminated soils had
an elevated rate of respiration at day 1 compared with the
rest of the experiment, possibly because of the disturbance
involved in mixing the soils and placing them into the
microcosms.
Microbial biomass (as measured by total PLFA concentrations; Fig. 3) was also stimulated by diesel addition. IN
and CW diesel-contaminated soil reached a maximum of
biomass by day 27, at which point the levels were
signi®cantly elevated over the equivalent control soil. After
day 27, the biomass decreased in the diesel-contaminated

simultaneously at the end of the experiment. PLFAs were
extracted and analysed as described previously, using a
modi®ed Bligh and Dyer extraction protocol (Bligh and
Dyer 1959; Tunlid and White 1992). Brie¯y, the soil
lipids were extracted in a one-phase chloroform/methanol/citrate buffer mixture, and the phospholipids separated by liquid chromatography over octadecyl-bonded
silica columns. The phospholipids were then derivatized
to their corresponding methyl esters, and analysed using
GC-FID (BaÊaÊth et al. 1998). Individual PLFAs are named
in the text according to standard conventions (Tunlid and
White 1992).

conclusion of the experiment. Microbial biomass was also
stimulated in BY soil by the addition of diesel, and reached
its maximum value by day 103. BY had a lower biomass than
for IN and CW, both at the start and for the entire duration
of the experiment; concentrations were signi®cantly lower
than for IN and CW at all times for both control and dieselcontaminated soils.
Changes in soil pH
Trends in the soil pH were also affected by diesel
contamination. For IN and BY, the pH in the dieselcontaminated soils remained at a constant level, but the pH
in the control soils showed a signi®cant decrease of 0á8±1á0

pH units during the course of the experiment (Fig. 4). CW
did not show the same pattern.

caused colour development for all of the samples, and none
of the aromatic or cyclic carboxylic acids did so. The carbon
sources added to the MT plates, when analysed in
combination with the GN data (i.e. as a dataset of 115
carbon sources), did not improve the discrimination in

multivariate space of the different samples when compared
with the discrimination given by the GN data alone (results
not shown). Analysis of the MT data alone showed no, or
only poor discrimination between samples. Consequently,
only the GN data were used for further data analysis, and all
further results presented in this paper are those from GN
data only.
GN carbon sources. PCA of the GN carbon source data
shows a clear separation of samples with respect to time, soil
type and treatment (Fig. 5). The most important factor with
respect to grouping the data would appear to be incubation
time. The non-incubated (day 1) samples are separated from
the other samples along a composite axis based on principal
components 1 and 2. The incubated diesel-contaminated
samples are also separated from the incubated control
samples along this same axis (approximately equivalent to
x  ±y). Finally, samples are separated according to soil
type for the diesel-contaminated samples only along a
second composite axis perpendicular to the ®rst (approximately equivalent to x  y).
The data were re-analysed by PCA for each sampling
date, separately, in order to clarify the effect of diesel on the
sole carbon source utilization pro®les, i.e. without including
incubation time as an extra potential source of variation
within the data, which might mask the effects of experimental treatment. The results from these separate analyses
are shown in Fig. 6(a±d).
No obvious differences were observed between soil types
at day one, although CW tended to have higher PC1 scores.
Biolog CLPPs at all other sampling times showed clear
separation according to both soil type and treatment with
diesel. It is arguable which time showed the greatest effect of
oil addition. Day 27 showed a complete separation of control

and treated soils for BY and IN along PC 1, although not for
CW (Fig. 6b). In comparison, by day 103, the separation
caused by diesel treatment was at its most obvious; all the
control soils clustered together, and were totally separated
from all the treated soils. However, the separation was along
PC2, and therefore did not account for as great a proportion
of the variance as if it had been on PC1.
The trend of similarity between different soil types is
clearer to follow. There was little difference between soil
types at day one. By day 27, there was a developing effect of
soil type along PC2; it is clear that diesel-treated soils are
more variable along PC 2 than the control soils. By day 62,
the control soils, with the exception of one outlying point,
were more similar than the diesel-treated soils, lying close
together in multivariate space. The effects were clearest at
day 103; the control soils were now separated from the
contaminated soils along PC2, and soil types were completely separated along PC1 for the contaminated soils only.
PLFA pro®les
PCA of the PLFA concentration data shows that there is
complete separation along PC 1 (Fig. 7) between control and
diesel-treated soils for the incubated samples, i.e. dieselcontaminated soils clustered with controls at day 1 but were
separated on all subsequent dates. There was some separation according to soil type along PC 2 for the incubated
contaminated soils only; BY soils were distinct from CW,
and IN soils were intermediate, overlapping with both BY
and CW. As for the Biolog data, PCA was carried out for
each sampling date separately.
The day 1 data (Fig. 8a) were separated by soil type on a
composite axis made up of PC 3 and PC 4. There was no
discernible effect of treatment within the ®rst four PCs.

The day 27 data (Fig. 8b) show that diesel treatment is
the major source of variation, with contaminated soils
completely separated from control soils along PC 1. PC 1
has a high R2 value of 0á67. Samples separated according to
soil type, for the contaminated soils only, along PC 2. There
is no separation of soil type in the control soils.
The day 62 data (Fig. 8c) follow the same pattern as for
the day 27 data. Diesel treatment is again the major source of
variation, with contaminated soils separated from control
soils along PC 1. Contaminated samples only were separated
with respect to soil type along PC 2; BY was completely
separated from the other soil types, but IN and CW were
not separated. The control soils formed a tight cluster and
were not separated at all by soil type, as for the day 27 data.
The day 102 data (Fig. 8d) were separated by treatment
along a combination of PC 1 and PC 2. The amount of
spread between individual data points was similar for the
control and contaminated soils.
The individual PLFAs that caused the most variation along
each axis were also determined by PCA. At day 27, the PLFAs
most signi®cant in causing separation along PC 1 (i.e. separation according to diesel addition) were 18 : 1x9, 18 : 2x6
and 17 : 1x8 (associated with the contaminated soils), and
19 : 0cy (associated with the control soils). Examining the

Sample time is represented by the size of the
symbols: smallest symbols correspond to

(day 103)

PCA for the day 63 and day 102 data shows that 18 : 1x9
remains the lipid with the highest loading associated with the
contaminated soils. The PLFAs 15 : 0 and 16 : 0 also appear
associated with the contaminated soils for days 63 and 102.
DISCUSSION
Ef®ciency of bioremediation
The duration of the experiment was clearly suf®cient for the
initial, rapid phase of bioremediation to be completed for IN
and CW; the rate of removal of oil had dropped almost to
zero by the end of the experiment (Fig. 1). It can be seen
that diesel was not degraded as quickly in BY soil; BY has a
sandier texture than the other two soils, and contains a lower
proportion of organic carbon and microbial biomass. The
lower degradation rate of diesel is presumably caused by the
lower microbial biomass at the start of the experiment. One
consequence is that degradation had not ®nished in BY by
the conclusion of the bioremediation treatment; evidence for
this is given both by the rate of loss of oil (Fig. 1), and by
the continuing elevation of soil respiration over background
(control) levels (Fig. 2). This is useful insofar as it allows the
comparison of the two soils in which bioremediation appears

to have been completed to one in which oil degradation is
still occurring, although at a lower rate than at the beginning
of the experiment.
It should be noted that the total proportion of oil
removed (up to about 60%) is not especially high. A more

active bioremediation treatment (for example, enhancing
oxygen availability) might have resulted in degradation of
a greater percentage of diesel (Ritter and Scarborough
1995). However, maximizing the extent of bioremediation
was not one of the aims of this study.

Selection of MT carbon sources
The MT carbon sources were selected on the basis of their
expected occurrence as intermediates in hydrocarbon
degradation pathways (Singer and Finnerty 1984). Carboxylic
acids were chosen, rather than the parent hydrocarbons, as
they possess greater water solubility and lower volatility than
the equivalent hydrocarbons. Carboxylic acids have been
shown to accumulate and then degrade in oil-contaminated
microcosms (Watson et al. 1999). Mesarch and Nies (1997)
showed that TPH in contaminated soil samples was
correlated with the numbers of bacteria culturable on
benzoate as a carbon source.
Lack of response to MT carbon sources
It is not known why there was no effect of oil contamination
on the ability of the soil culturable communities in this study
to utilize hydrocarbon-based carboxylic acids as carbon
sources. One possibility is that the amount of carboxylic acid
added to the microtitre wells was inhibitory for the aromatic
compounds, and that a lower concentration would have
permitted growth and hence, potentially differing responses
(Fulthorpe and Allen 1994). A second possibility is that
there was no enrichment of aromatic hydrocarbon degraders

during the course of the experiment, i.e. that only the
aliphatic portion of the diesel oil was being degraded, and
that the capability of the indigenous population to grow on
straight-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids was already so high
that it was not enhanced by diesel addition. All of the soils
showed the ability to degrade all of the straight-chain
aliphatic carboxylic acids tested from the beginning of the
experiment.
Biolog GN pro®les: community response
to oil pollution
The ®rst impression that is received on examining the PCA
scores plot of the entire Biolog GN dataset (Fig. 5) is that
the major shift in community pro®les has occurred as a
result of incubation, and outweighs the effects of oil
addition. Other studies using Biolog plates have also
reported large incubation effects (WuÈnsche et al. 1995).
Further information on the effects of diesel contamination
on the similarity of different community pro®les is therefore
easier to see when the data from each sampling point are
analysed separately (Fig. 6).
There is no obvious clustering at day 1. The only clear
effect is that CW tends to have higher PC1 scores, but
there is by no means complete separation from the other

two soil types. This lack of differentiation of soil types
was unexpected; possibly, the disturbance of the soils
entailed by mixing and transferring to microcosms tended
to reduce differences between the soil types. Certainly the
soil respiration was increased over the levels that then
prevailed for the remainder of the experiment (Fig. 2),

which would imply that microbial activity had been
disturbed. As very little is known about the dynamics and
short-term effects of disturbance on Biolog community
pro®les, this must remain a conjectural point until further
work is done.

The day 1 data do show that there was no acute effect of
diesel addition on soil bacteria, as might have occurred for
example if the applied diesel had had a toxic effect.
It is clear that diesel addition did not increase the
similarity between different soil types, as measured by
Biolog CLPPs. In fact, the opposite effect occurred; the
difference between soil types increased. There was little
differentiation between soil types at the beginning of the
experiment. It may be argued that this could have been
caused by the initial disturbance of the soil, but throughout the course of the experiment, the control soils tended
to cluster together in principal component space. CW is a
partial exception to this; the CW controls are separated
from the other two soil types at day 27, and one out of the
three CW controls is separated at day 62. Conversely, the
diesel-contaminated soil types become more dissimilar
during the course of the experiment and by day 62, the
contaminated samples are completely separated on PC1
according to soil type, with the effect continuing by
day 103.
It must be borne in mind that the increasing dissimilarity of the diesel-contaminated soil communities in
multivariate space does not enable any conclusions to be
drawn about absolute diversity of the soils as measured,
for example, by species richness or evenness. Atlas et al.
(1991) found that petrol contamination increased the
ability of a microbial community to utilize a range of
substrates but decreased the overall bacterial diversity.
They concluded that hydrocarbon contamination selected
for a reduced number of generalist, catabolically-versatile
species. Lindstrom et al. (1999) studied the effects of
long-term oil contamination in an Arctic soil; they
inoculated Biolog plates at a range of serial dilutions,
and found that increasing dilution reduced the number of
substrates utilized by control soils to a much greater
extent than for oil-affected soils. They similarly concluded
that this showed that oil contamination selected for a less
diverse, but catabolically-versatile bacterial community.
Juck et al. (2000) found that, at two oil-contaminated
Arctic sites investigated by DGGE and Biolog analysis,
absolute diversity was decreased at one site and remained
the same or increased at the other. Thus, it seems likely,
on the basis of comparison with previous ®ndings, that
the absolute diversity in each one of the different soil
types tested in this study would have been decreased as a
result of diesel contamination. What this study demonstrates is that oil contamination and bioremediation does
not lead to increasing similarity of different soil types; it
seems likely that each diesel-contaminated soil converged
on a different generalist bacterial community.
The results obtained from the Biolog CLPPs are
dependent on culturing of bacteria (Garland and Mills
1991) and therefore, subject to biases (Haack et al. 1995;

Konopka et al. 1998). This does not necessarily mean that
CLPPs are meaningless for the study of soil microbial
ecology, but it does require that they be interpreted with
care and, ideally, compared with a non-culture-based
technique (Garland 1997). Extraction and analysis of PLFAs
is one such technique.
PLFA pro®les: community response
to oil pollution
Community PLFA pro®ling has previously been shown to
respond to hydrocarbon-induced changes in soil populations
(Macnaughton et al. 1999; White et al. 1999; Venosa et al.
2000).
The effect of diesel addition on soil community PLFA
pro®les is clear (Fig. 7). Diesel treatment is the major source
of variation within the dataset, with much more of an effect
than either incubation time or soil type. The PCA of
individual date PLFA data con®rms this (Fig. 8); soil types
are separated on day 1, but only on a combination of PCs
3 and 4. For all the remaining time points, diesel treatment
has a greater effect than soil type.
The PLFA pro®les con®rm the information obtained
from the Biolog CLPPs about the relative similarity of the
soil types and the effect of diesel addition. Diesel treatment
increases the disparity in community structure of the
different soil types as measured by PLFA pro®les. It can
be seen particularly clearly for the day 27 data (Fig. 8b),
when biodegradative activity was at a maximum (as shown
by diesel removal, respiration and biomass levels), that the
three soil types are completely separated along PC 2 for the
contaminated soils, yet the control soils form a single
group. This pattern is also continued for the day 63
results.
Individual PLFAs affected by diesel addition
The speci®c PLFAs that change between samples in PLFA
pro®ling for microbial ecology are often interpreted to give
some idea as to which taxonomic groups are changing, and
also the nutritional status of the microbiota. However, in
general, this is not valuable for studies of oil bioremediation
as usually, all that can be deduced is that oil contamination
leads to a relative increase in the proportion of Gramnegative bacteria within the community (Venosa et al. 2000).
In this study, the PLFAs 18 : 1x9 and 17 : 1x8 were
increased by diesel bioremediation; the x9 series of
monounsaturated PLFAs have been ascribed to Grampositive bacteria. This indicates the dif®culty of unambiguously explaining changes in PLFAs, when the PLFAs are
not found solely in a single taxonomic group. A possible
complicating effect is that growth on hydrocarbons may
change the lipid pro®les of individual strains (Doumenq

ã 2002 The Society for Applied Microbiology, Journal of Applied Microbiology, 92, 276±288

EFFECTS OF DIESEL ON SOIL COMMUNITIES

et al. 1999). It has been suggested that sphingolipids may be
genuine biomarkers for hydrocarbon-degrading populations
(White et al. 1998; Zelles 1999), but sphingolipids were not
measured in this study. The PLFA 18 : 2x6 can be reliably
assigned to the soil fungal community, and the changes in
18 : 2x6 observed at day 27 indicates that there was an
increase in the fungal community caused by diesel addition.
Direct comparison of Biolog and PLFA
It is instructive to compare directly the performance of the
two community-level techniques. Several previous studies
have done this for soil microbial communities (e.g. BaÊaÊth
et al. 1998; Bossio and Scow 1998; Yao et al. 2000), but
none directly for the assessment of oil contamination and
bioremediation. The clearest difference is that the Biolog
CLPPs were much more affected by incubation than were
the PLFA pro®les. Thus, in one sense, the CLPPs were
more `sensitive' than PLFA pro®ling and may suggest
important changes in the properties of the culturable microorganisms. This sensitivity to incubation, however, is not
useful in the context of assessing changes caused by an
external treatment, in this case diesel addition and bioremediation. The effects of diesel addition are much more clearly
observed in the PLFA pro®les than the Biolog CLPPs,
particularly when data from all the time points are analysed
simultaneously.
White et al. (1998) suggested that the multivariate
response of the microbial community, i.e. the community
pro®le, could be used to evaluate the success of bioremediation; a perturbation observed in multivariate space,
followed by a return to control levels, would indicate that
bioremediation had successfully mitigated the impact on the
microbial community. In this study, there was no evidence
of a return to control pro®les for the Biolog CLPPs. There
was some indication that the microbial community structure
may have returned to control pro®les for the PLFA data.
The IN diesel-contaminated soil shows the greatest deviation from uncontaminated soils at day 27, and is progressively closer to the control soils at day 63 and day 102
(Fig. 7). Furthermore, the control and diesel-contaminated
soils are separated along PC 1 for the days 27 and 63 data,
but along a combination of PCs 1 and 2 for the day 102 data
(Fig. 8), i.e. the amount of variation in the dataset
attributable to diesel contamination had decreased.
In conclusion, this study has con®rmed the null hypothesis: diesel contamination of different soil types did not
lead to increasing similarity of the microbial communities.
In fact, the effect of diesel on both PLFA and Biolog pro®les
was to make much more distinct the separation between soil
types. It appears that soil types, representing differing
environmental matrices and different initial microbial communities, have different inherent microbial responses to

287

hydrocarbon contamination and thus, possibly, degradation
potential. The largest changes seen in the Biolog CLPPs
were caused by incubation rather than diesel contamination.
It is likely that soil microcosm studies, which, of necessity,
use disturbed soils under arti®cial conditions, are not
representative of in situ effects. Future work using Biolog
CLPPs to investigate oil remediation would be best carried
out with contaminated ®eld sites.
