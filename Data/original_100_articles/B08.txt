Abstract
A survey of soil gases associated with gasoline stations on the Swan Coastal Plain of Western Australia has shown
that 20% leak detectable amounts of petroleum. The fates of volatile hydrocarbons in the vadose zone at one
contaminated site, and dissolved hydrocarbons in groundwater at another site were followed in a number of studies
which are herein reviewed. Geochemical evidence from a plume of hydrocarbon-contaminated groundwater has
shown that sulfate reduction rapidly developed as the terminal electron accepting process. Toluene degradation
but not benzene degradation was linked to sulfate reduction. The sulfate-reducing bacteria isolated from the plume
represented a new species, Desulfosporosinus meridiei. Strains of the species do not mineralise 14C-toluene in pure
culture. The addition of large numbers of cells and sulfate to microcosms did stimulate toluene mineralisation but
not benzene mineralisation. Attempts to follow populations of sulfate-reducing bacteria by phospholipid signatures,
or Desulfosporosinus meridiei by FISH in the plume were unsuccessful, but fluorescently-labeled polyclonal
antibodies were successfully used. In the vadose zone at a different site, volatile hydrocarbons were consumed in
the top 0.5 m of the soil profile. The fastest measured rate of mineralisation of 14C-benzene in soils collected from
the most active zone (6.5 mg kg−1 day−1) could account for the majority of the flux of hydrocarbon vapour towards
the surface. The studies concluded that intrinsic remediation by subsurface microbial populations in groundwater
on the Swan Coastal Plain can control transport of aromatic hydrocarbon contamination, except for the transport of
benzene in groundwater. In the vadose zone, intrinsic remediation by the microbial populations in the soil profile
can contain the transport of aromatic hydrocarbons, provided the physical transport of gases, in particular oxygen
from the atmosphere, is not impeded by structures.
Introduction
Of all the components of gasoline, some of the
most mobile in the environment (i.e., most soluble
and volatile), and thus more likely to be transported
“off-site” (Figure 1) are among the most hazardous.
For example, benzene is relatively soluble in water
(1780 mg l−1) and volatile (Henry’s Law constant =
550 Pa m3 mol−1) and is a known carcinogen (Cohen
1996). One guideline “trigger value” for benzene in
Australia, the concentration at which some action is
required, is 600 µg l−1, although the trigger value
may change depending on the nature of the environment
or when benzene is in the presence of “other
contaminants” (Chapman & Warne 2000).
The Swan Coastal Plain of Western Australia, on
which the city of Perth is located, has a major refinery
and many small gasoline distribution sites. Significant
hydrocarbon contamination occurs at the refinery
and in a survey of gasoline station sites, 20% showed
signs of aromatic hydrocarbon leakage to groundwater
(Barber et al. 1991). The fate of dissolved and
volatile hydrocarbons in groundwaters and soils in the
vicinity of Perth, on the Swan Coastal Plain, have
been studied because of the potential environmental
and health risks associated with gasoline contamination.
Because of the extent of contamination, intrinsic

remediation will, perhaps by default, play a significant
role in contaminant removal and protection of the
environment.
Spillage of gasoline in the environment usually results
in transport of the majority of the contamination
to the surface of the groundwater where it floats as a
“light non-aqueous phase liquid” (LNAPL). The most
toxic components of the gasoline, the aromatic hydrocarbons,
follow one of two routes. They either slowly
dissolve in the groundwater, and move in solution in
the direction of groundwater flow, or they volatilise
from the LNAPL and the groundwater into the gas
phase in the vadose zone (Figure 1). As the contamination
essentially moves in two planes, horizontally with
the groundwater flow, and vertically through the soil
profile, intrinsic remediation can be studied by following
(1) the changes in the mass of contaminants along
the flow paths, (2) the geochemical changes brought
about by microbial metabolism along the flow paths
and (3) the microbial activity and populations along
the flow paths. A service station site with a discrete
point source of contamination has been the focus of a
number of studies on intrinsic remediation in groundwater.
A site with extensive contamination over a wide
area, a refinery site, has been the focus of studies
on fate and transport of aromatic hydrocarbons in the
vadose zone. These studies are reviewed here.
Intrinsic remediation of aromatic hydrocarbons in
groundwater
Groundwater contamination and site characterisation
The Swan Coastal Plain is essentially a sand plain
with a shallow unconfined aquifer with groundwater
flow from the hills to the east and to the Indian
Ocean to the west. Depths to groundwater vary by
up to 1.8 m depending on the season. In the zone
of groundwater table fluctuation, there is generally a
cemented layer of iron oxyhydroxide-coated organic
enriched sand. In the vicinity of the gasoline contaminated
site, the groundwater velocity was between 100
and 170 m year−1, effective porosity was between 0.26
to 0.3 m3 m−3, and the hydraulic conductivity ranged
67
from 8.6 to 29 m day−1 (Davis et al. 1999). Petroleum
contamination of the aquifer from a leaking underground
petroleum storage tank (UST) was discovered
in 1990. Sample collection multiports (MP) (Davis et
al. 1992) were installed that allowed water collection
from 0.2 or 0.5 m depths at specific sites along the
flow path of the contamination and the contamination
plume was monitored over a five year period. There
were minor variations in the position of the plume over
the years, and typical maps of benzene concentration,
toluene concentration and sulfate concentration in the
groundwater are given in Figure 2, along with the
positioning of the multiport sample sites.
In addition to toluene and benzene, the plume
contained ethylbenzene, m- and p- xylene, o-xylene,
1,3,5-trimethyl benzene and naphthalene in significant
concentrations. In April 1991, the benzene plume
extended over 420 m from the site of initial contamination
(past MP8), whereas the toluene plume was less
than 250 m long (it had disappeared before MP7, Figure
2). M- and p-xylene and ethylbenzene were also
detectable 420 m down the plume whereas o-xylene,
1,3,5-trimethylbenzene and naphthalene were not. Retardation
coefficients due to sorption for benzene and
toluene in aquifer material from this site are very similar,
1.02 and 1.05, respectively, (Thierrin et al. 1993).
The limited retardation with respect to a conservative
bromide tracer probably resulted from the very low
organic carbon content in these sands (0.008–0.02%,
Patterson et al. 1993). Truncation of the toluene plume
with respect to the benzene plume (Figure 2) could not
be explained in terms of the differences in the physical
attributes of toluene versus benzene. The distribution
of these two contaminants in the plume would be
consistent with preferential biodegradation of toluene.
The concomitant loss of sulfate with the truncation
of the toluene plume (Figure 2) provides geochemical
evidence for toluene mineralisation linked to
sulfate reduction as the terminal step in toluene mineralisation,
especially as methane was not detected
in the groundwater from within the plume (Davis et
al. 1999). Groundwaters on the Swan Coastal Plain
are generally anoxic. The concentrations of potential
electron acceptors and their reduction products in the
groundwater are given in Table 1. Analyses of cores
from outside the plume showed that, at the depths at
which the contamination occurred, extractible Fe(III)
was at concentrations generally <200 µg g−1, and was
not extractable in 0.5 M HCl, but was extractable in
5.0 M HCl (Prommer et al. 1999). This would suggest
that most of the Fe(III) occurred in a highly crystalline

donors and their reduction products both within and

form and was not available for microbial reduction
(Prommer et al. 1999). The absence of appreciable
bioavailable reducible iron is evidenced by the minimal
amount of Fe2+ in the groundwater, either inside
or outside the plume.
Minimal nitrate occurred in uncontaminated background
groundwater near the site but appreciably
more sulfate was available as a terminal electron acceptor
for anaerobic respiration of the contaminants
(Table 1). In the uncontaminated groundwater, nitrate
concentrations averaged 0.18 mg N l−1 (ca. 0.01 mM)
and sulfate concentrations averaged 27.5 mg S −1 (ca.
0.86 mM). Stoichiometric equations for the oxidation
of toluene using nitrate and sulfate are given in Equations
(1) and (2) (see Borden et al. 1995; Edwards
et al. 1992). Considerably more nitrate than sulfate
is required to oxidise one mole of toluene. Given the
average amount of each electron acceptor available in
the groundwater, sulfate reduction will be the more
important electron accepting process in this aquifer,
despite the preferential use of nitrate as an electron acceptor
by microbial populations conducting anaerobic
respiration.

in the concentration of carbonate ions in the plume relative
to the concentration in the background groundwater
(Table 1) is also consistent with sulfate reduction
(Equation (2)). What is disturbing, from a human
and environmental health point of view, is that there
was no evidence in this plume of benzene degradation
linked to sulfate reduction (Figure 2).
Degradation in columns, and field tracer tests
Given the geochemical characteristics of the plume,
and the inference that toluene but not benzene was
undergoing anaerobic mineralisation, work was conducted
in saturated columns of aquifer material in
order to confirm or negate the field observations. In
these studies, benzene was degraded under aerobic
conditions, but not under nitrate-reducing or sulfatereducing
conditions over 133 days, even in the absence
of other hydrocarbons (Patterson et al. 1993). Toluene
rapidly degraded under nitrate-reducing conditions,
within 31 days, and also showed concomitant degradation
with sulfate depletion in groundwater that was not
amended with nitrate (Patterson et al. 1993).
Thierrin et al. (1993) conducted in-plume tracer
tests using the deuterated compounds, benzene-d6,
toluene-d6, p-xylene-d10 and naphthalene-d8, and
bromide as a conservative tracer. After dissolving the
compounds in anoxic groundwater that had been collected
from the site, they injected the water into the
plume (near multiport 3, Figure 2) and monitored the
breakthrough of the compounds 17 m down gradient
from the injection bore. Degradation of benzene was
not significant, as the breakthrough time and relative
mass of benzene-d6 recovery was essentially the
same as for the conservative tracer. The other compounds
showed loss of mass relative to benzene and
the tracer. Thierrin et al. (1993) used the analytical
transport model SOLUTE to derive first order degradation
rates for the plume from the hydrocarbon
distribution data and the tracer test and the rates are
compared in Table 2.
Microbial biomass and community structure – initial
investigations
An initial brief examination of the microbial populations
using fluorescent in situ hybridization probes,
specific for Bacteria (EUB338) and species of the
genus Desulfovibrio (SRB385) (Amann et al. 1990)
was conducted on water drawn from a number of the

multiports, both from within and outside the plume (S.
Toze, pers. comm.). Few cells in the groundwater reacted
with either stain, and considerable background
autofluorescence prevented any definitive assessment
of the microbial community structure.
The analysis of the fatty acids from membrane
phospholipids has been extensively used in culture
independent assessment of microbial communities
(White et al. 1983), especially in soils and sediments,
which are difficult environments to analyse definitively
by molecular techniques. Phospholipid fatty
acids (PLFA) were analysed in three cores from within
and along the contamination plume (near MP11, MP3,
and MP8; see Figure 2) and one core from outside
the plume (near MP9; see Figure 2) (Franzmann et al.
1996). The PLFA were extracted from core material
collected from depths of about 30 cm above the water
table, at the water table, and from a depth within
the contamination plume. Particulates were collected
on large in-line filters (0.22 µm) from groundwater
within the contamination plume from similar depth
multiports adjacent to the sites of core collection.
A summary of outcomes of the analyses is given in
Table 3.
Of the groundwater samples taken, the sample
that contained the lowest viable biomass was in the
plume at MP11. This sample was from the site that
contained the greatest amount of aromatic hydrocarbons
(136 mg l−1; Davis et al. 1999), whereas the
greatest biomass in the groundwater occurred at MP3
where the water contains considerably less aromatic
hydrocarbons (48 mg l−1; Davis et al. 1999). Long
et al. (1995) noted a drop-off in microbial biomass
in subsurface samples that were exposed to high con-

centrations of petroleum hydrocarbons, which they
defined as samples that contained “free product or
non-aqueous phase liquid and contaminants dissolved
in the groundwater in parts per million”. According
to Davis et al. (1999), the concentrations of benzene
and toluene at MP11 were often comparable to
concentrations in equilibrium with gasoline NAPL.
The percentage of biomass attached to the aquifer
substrate, as opposed to in the groundwater, can be
calculated from the data in Table 4. In the vicinity of
multiports MP9, MP11, MP3 and MP8, the percentage
of biomass that was attached to the substrate was 98%,
99%, 96% and 98%, respectively. The percentage attached
was always high, but greatest in cores taken
from the region of highest contaminant concentration,
MP11. It is generally considered that microorganisms
in biofilms tolerate higher concentrations of toxic contaminants
than “free living” microbial cells (Foley &
Gilbert 1996).
Two phospholipid-derived fatty acids have been
commonly used as signature fatty acids for the presence
of sulfate-reducing bacteria. The fatty acids
i17:1c9 and 10-methyl-16:0 are supposedly indicative
of Desulfovibrio spp. and Desulfobacter spp., respectively.
Neither signature was found in the PLFAs in
core material collected from below the groundwater
table in the zone of sulfate depletion (Franzmann et
al. 1996). The fatty acid 10-methyl-16:0 was found
in soil cores from outside the contaminant plume,
either above or at the aquifer water table. A range
of monomethylated fatty acids may be derived from
actinomycetes that occur in aerobic soils (Zelles et al.
1995).
Enrichment and isolation of sulfate-reducing bacteria

phospholipid fatty acids of material from the contaminated
site, provided evidence of populations of
sulfate-reducing bacteria. Enrichments for sulfate-

reducing bacteria that contained toluene-in-paraffin oil
or benzoate were prepared from anaerobic groundwater
taken from the plume; from multiports MP11 and
MP2 (Figure 2) (Robertson et al. 2000). Pure cultures
of sulfate-reducing bacteria were isolated using roll
tubes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of the
cultures (n = 8) could be accommodated within the
genus Desulfosporosinus in the Gram positive, low
G + C, line of descent (see Figure 3). The strains
were described as a new species, Desulfosporosinus
meridiei (Robertson et al. 2001). The extraction of
DNA for PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA from
the strains generally required beating with zirconium
beads and generally could not be obtained by chemical
lyses (Robertson et al. 2000).
All of the major fatty acids that occurred in Desulfosporosinus
meridiei (Robertson et al. 2000) also
occurred in the phospholipid extracts of core material
from the contaminated site (Franzmann et al. 1996).
The cells lacked the fatty acid signatures often used as
markers for sulfate reducing bacteria in environmental
samples; i17:1c9 and 10-methyl-16:0. Members of
the species also lacked the 16S rRNA hybridization
sites for FISH probes that are commonly used for the
detection of sulfate-reducing bacteria.
Microcosm tests
Microcosm tests with ring-labeled 14C-benzene and
14C-toluene showed that Desulfosporosinus strains
were incapable of mineralizing either compound to
14CO2 (Robertson et al. 2000). To test the role that
Desulfosporosinus meridiei may have in benzene or
toluene degradation, the rate of mineralisation of 14Cbenzene
and 14C-toluene was determined in a series
of microcosms of collected groundwater, with different
additions of sulfate, cells of Desulfosporosinus
meridiei or molybdate as an inhibitor of sulfate reduction.
The rate of toluene mineralisation was minimal
in non-amended groundwater, but was enhanced by
the addition of sulfate, and further enhanced by the
addition of both sulfate and cells of Desulfosporosinus
meridiei (Table 4). The rate of toluene mineralisation
in the microcosm that received sulfate with
molybdate was slower than the mineralisation rate
in non-amended groundwater. The rate of benzene
mineralisation in non-amended groundwater was minimal,
and was not enhanced by the addition of sulfate
or sulfate with cells of Desulfosporosinus meridiei
(Table 4). Interestingly, groundwater collected from
outside the contamination plume showed a greater
capacity for toluene mineralisation than groundwater
collected from within the contamination plume
(Table 4). Although the sulfate addition, and further
addition of an inoculum of sulfate-reducing bacteria
greatly stimulated toluene mineralisation in the microcosms,
the pure culture of sulfate-reducing bacterium
that was added did not mineralise toluene. It is thus
probable that Desulfosporosinus meridiei plays a similar
role in this plume to the role methanogens play
in toluene-degrading consortia. That is, they consume
the hydrogen and organic acids produced by
fermentative organisms from the toluene, thus preventing
the accumulation of fermentation products
that would otherwise make the further degradation of
toluene thermodynamically impossible (Zwolinski et
al. 2000). The mineralisation rates for toluene in the
groundwater microcosms were considerably slower
than degradation rates measured in the field (Davis
et al. 1999). Microcosms experiments always contain
artifacts, and should be used only to indicate the
potential microbial processes. As the PLFA analysis
showed that at least 98% of the microbial biomass was
substrate bound, it is not surprising that the use of

groundwater alone in microcosms would greatly underestimate
the potential for microbial degradation of
the contaminants.
Tracking Desulfosporosinus meridiei in the plume
The only sulfate-reducing species that was isolated
from the plume was Desulfosporosinus meridiei,
which would have evaded detection by the FISH
technique used in the initial studies, and which did
not contain the PLFA signatures usually indicative
of sulfate-reducing bacteria. To examine the plume
for the presence of Desulfosporosinus meridiei, both
species-specific polyclonal fluorescent antibodies and
FISH probes, as well as eubacterial FISH probes were
prepared (Robertson 2000). The reaction of cultured
cells to the polyclonal antibodies and the speciesspecific
FISH probes are shown in Figure 4. The
outcomes of the FISH and antibody probing are given
in Table 5. Robertson’s study was limited to the examination
of groundwater due to the cost and other
constraints on re-drilling for core material.
Although cultured cells of Desulfosporosinus meridiei
produced a signal when probed with the oligonucleotide
probe, the cells fluoresced faintly when
compared with the signal produced by cells subjected
to antibody probing (Figure 4). Cells of Desulfosporosinus
meridiei were not detected in any

groundwater sample by the FISH probe designed for
Desulfosporosinus meridiei. Desulfosporosinus meridiei
was detected by antibody probing, but numbers
were less than 0.2% of the total population of cells
(the numbers detected by DAPI staining). What is also
of note, was that numbers of Desulfosporosinus meridiei
were as great in water from outside the plume
(MP9) as in groundwater drawn from inside the plume
(MP11, MP16, MP8; Table 5). This is consistent
with the observation that groundwater from outside the
plume showed the same potential to mineralise toluene,
under sulfate-reducing conditions, as water drawn
from inside the plume.
At best, 29% of the DAPI-stained cells in the
groundwater samples stained with the bacterial probe
EUB338 (Table 5). The outcomes of the use of FISH
probing of aquifer material have rarely been reported.
Zarda et al. (1998) reported that between 3 to 42%
of the cells that stained with DAPI in aquifer material
contaminated with aromatic hydrocarbons, could
be detected by FISH with probe EUB338. As pointed
out by Zarda et al. (1998), detection rates after
hybridization with probe EUB338 are used as an indication
for the presence of metabolically active cells
which contain sufficient amounts of rRNA coupled
with sufficient cell permeability or permeabilisation to
permit their detection. Watanabe et al. (2000) found
that FISH was much poorer than PCR and denaturing
gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) at detection of
microorganisms in groundwater associated with crude
oil storage facilities. In their study, labeled cells exhibited
weak signals, which was attributed to low rRNA
contents resulting from a groundwater residence time
of 7 days in the cavities, and limited availability of
electron acceptors.
The intensity of the signal obtained with FISH rapidly
decreases with cell age, to less than 20% of the
initial intensity by day 25 for some sulfate-reducing
bacteria (Bade et al. 2000). In slow moving groundwater,
in which the transport of nutrients to and products
away from cells would be extremely slow, the average
cell age must be much greater than in dynamic environments
such as activated sludge, in which sludge age
is usually less than 10 days, and in which the use of
FISH probing is considerably more successful (Daims
et al. 1999). However, Fredrickson et al. (1995) were
able to successfully probe for delta proteobacteria in
some deep subsurface samples from an aquifer with
low hydraulic conductivity.
Desulfosporosinus meridiei could be detected in
groundwater from the site by antibody probing and
culture, but not by FISH probing. Given that Zarda
et al. (1998) also showed a poor response by groundwater
bacteria to FISH probing, its use for tracking
74
cells in contaminated aquifers would appear to be
problematic.
Aromatic hydrocarbon attenuation in groundwater on
the Swan coastal plain: Conclusions
Sulfate-reduction is the major terminal electron accepting
process for the intrinsic remediation of plumes
of aromatic hydrocarbons on the Swan Coastal Plain.
Although toluene degradation can occur under methanogenic
conditions, methanogenesis does not play
a significant role on the Swan Coastal Plain even
after considerable sulfate depletion in the groundwater.
Benzene can be degraded under sulfate-reducing
conditions (Lovley et al. 1995) but this does not occur
significantly in the Swan Coastal Plain aquifer.
The reason for this is unknown. However, benzene is
rapidly degraded in Swan Coastal Plain aquifer material
under aerobic or nitrate-reducing conditions. As
benzene does not show natural attenuation by microbial
populations in the Swan Coastal Plain aquifer,
high concentrations persist in groundwater for large
distances down-gradient from a source of contamination.
These findings have serious implications for
the management of gasoline-contaminated sites on
the Swan Coastal Plain, especially as groundwater
supplies about 70% of water used in the area.
It has proved difficult to define the microbial community
structure responsible for the attenuation of
plumes of aromatic hydrocarbons on the Swan Coastal
Plain. FISH probing, which has yielded so much information
on microbial communities in many environments,
seems of little value in anaerobic groundwater
environments.
“In closing, it seems prudent to recognize that
understanding the identity and activity of microorganisms
in the subsurface, and in all other habitats, is a
major scientific challenge” (Madsen 2000).
Intrinsic remediation of aromatic hydrocarbons in
the vadose zone
A second major exposure pathway for carcinogenic
aromatic hydrocarbons from a contaminated subsurface
is through vapour transport through the soil to the
surface. It is not optimal to study this phenomenon
in thin plumes that result from small point-source
contamination from damaged or leaking underground
storage tanks such as those that occur on the Swan
Coastal Plain (Figure 2). Therefore the fate of hydrocarbon
vapours has been studied on the Swan Coastal
Plain at a refinery site where widespread LNAPL contamination
over a large surface area of the shallow
aquifer has occurred. The widespread contamination
allows study of the transport and biodegradation of
volatile hydrocarbons in the vertical plane without appreciable
“edge effects” on the vapour transport from
the groundwater table towards the surface.
Soil gases at the field site
The field site was a lightly grassed expanse that had
experienced hydrocarbon groundwater contamination
for probably more than 20 years. Residual LNAPL
occurred at the groundwater-vadose interface, and
free phase hydrocarbon accumulated in wells drilled
in the study area. To enable the collection of gases
from the soil profile, a number of multiport installations
that consisted of bundles of 2-mm i.d. nylon
tubes were installed at 0.25 m intervals to below the
groundwater-soil interface in early 1999. Profiles of
volatile hydrocarbons, mostly aromatic hydrocarbons
[namely benzene, toluene, isomers of xylene, and
1,3,5-trimethylbenzene] and the soil gases oxygen and
carbon dioxide, have been measured at the site over an
annual cycle (Davis et al. 2000). The results from two
of those profiles are shown in Figure 5.
The profiles changed greatly on a seasonal basis,
and the depth penetration of oxygen into the soil was
highly dependent upon the water content in the soil
profile (Davis et al. 2000). The Swan Coastal Plain receives
little rain over the Australian summer, 162 mm
from October to April, however, considerable precipitation
occurs during the Australian winter months
(609 mm from May to September). The increase in the
water content in the soil, reduces the air filled porosity,
especially in a moisture retaining layer at about 0.1 to
0.3 m below the ground surface, which restricts vapour
and oxygen transport. Thus in wet periods, aromatic
hydrocarbons penetrate much higher in the soil profile,
and oxygen penetration is shallower (Figure 5, Davis
et al. 2000).
Biodegradation in the vadose zone
Despite seasonal variability in the profiles of aromatic
hydrocarbons and oxygen in the soil profile, the presence
of oxygen coincided with an absence of aromatic
hydrocarbons (Figure 5; Davis et al. 2000). Field analyses
of groundwater samples have indicated that the
amount of BTX in groundwater is directly related to
the availability of dissolved oxygen. Aromatic hydrocarbons
are absent from groundwater in the vicinity of

contaminated sites if the dissolved oxygen content is
greater than 0.9 mg l−1 (Chiang et al. 1989).
Zeroth order oxygen consumption rates can be
determined from steady state oxygen versus depth pro-
files, provided the effective diffusion coefficient for
oxygen in the soil is known. In some cases this may
be problematic as, diffusion may be markedly affected
by factors such as moisture content (Davis et
al. 2000). The stoichiometric conversion of oxygen
depletion data to hydrocarbon degradation may also be
problematic as other oxidisable organic matter or oxidisable
inorganic reduced species (sulfur gases, Fe(II),
NH3) may account for some of the oxygen consumption
(Davis et al. 1998). From oxygen consumption
profiles, Davis et al. (1998) determined a hydrocarbon
degradation rate of between 110 to 170 mg-hexane
l
−1 day−1. With an average air-filled porosity of
0.49 m3 m−3 and a bulk density of 1340 kg m−3, this
equates to degradation rates of between 41 to 64 mg
(kg day)−1. These rates are high when compared with
rates determined in other studies that have measured
biodegradation of vapours from petroleum products
during active bioventing as reported by Hoeppel et al.
(1991) [up to 10 mg (kg day)−1 for JP-4 at Hill AFB;
2–20 mg (kg day)−1 for JP-4 at Tyndall AFB; 8 mg (kg
day)−1 for diesel in The Netherlands; 3 mg (kg day)−1
for JP-5 at Patuxent River, Maryland; 5 mg (kg day)−1
for JP-5 at Fallon, Nevada; 1 to 10 mg (kg day)−1
for JP-5 at Eilson AFB, Alaska]. To determine an unambiguous
mineralisation rate for volatile aromatics,
Franzmann et al. (1999) used 14C-ring-benzene in microcosms
with core material from a range of depths
in the soil profile to measure the potential for the soil
microbial community for benzene mineralisation. The
concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons, oxygen and
carbon dioxide in the soil profile at the time of sample
collection are given in Table 6, as are the mineralisation
rates, and estimates of the microbial biomass at
different depths within the soil profile.
Soil from a depth of 0.25 m showed the greatest
potential for mineralisation of 14C-benzene 83 ±
13 µmol (kg day)−1 [which is equivalent to 6.5 ±
1 mg (kg day)−1] (Table 6). Soil from this depth was
exposed to a plentiful supply of hydrocarbon vapour
and oxygen, 11.3 mg l−1 and 13%, respectively. At
a depth of 0.5 m, the oxygen content dropped to 3%
and approached the range that may be limiting for total
petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) mineralisation (2–5%;
Hickey 1995). The microbial population at this depth
showed a slightly less propensity for hydrocarbon
mineralisation. At the surface, the microbial population
was not exposed to measurable concentrations
of TPH (i.e., <1 mg l−1 ) but showed considerable
propensity to mineralise aromatic hydrocarbons. In
fact, the surface microbial population mineralised hydrocarbons
at about the same rate as measured in
surface soils from the Swan Coastal Plain that were
not associated with hydrocarbon contamination (23 to
42 µmol (kg day)−1; Franzmann et al. 1998). Further
evidence for the lack of hydrocarbon exposure to
the microbial population in the surface soil was the
relative lack of trans isomer monounsaturated fatty
acids in the phospholipid fraction extracted from this
soil (Table 6). Monounsaturated trans isomer fatty
acids are enriched in the phospholipids of aerobic
microbial populations when exposed to aromatic hydrocarbons
(Heipieper et al. 1994). There was little
propensity for anaerobic mineralisation of benzene in

soil deep within the profile (t1/2 = 173 years, Table
6). Simple modeling showed that, provided the zeroth
order mineralisation rates were used, the total flux
of hydrocarbon between depth 0.5 m and the surface
could be accounted for by the rate of aerobic hydrocarbon
mineralisation in that zone (Franzmann et al.
1999).
At the end of the wet season, when the vadose soils
contained considerably more water, TPH was much
higher in the profile (Figure 5). This occurred because
greater water saturation in the soil profile limited the
penetration of oxygen from the surface (Davis et al.
2000). Intrinsic remediation of aromatic vapours in
the vadose zone above gasoline-contaminated water
seems to generally occur, provided there are no impediments
to the transport of gases. With greater saturation
of the soil, TPH was higher in the profile (Figure
5). Moseley and Meyer (1992) showed that above
hydrocarbon-contaminated groundwater, greater accumulation
of soil gas aromatic hydrocarbons occurred
under paved areas and building structures than under
non-built-up areas. This resulted in substantial leakage
of benzene into the building structures and the
crawl space beneath the floors. For intrinsic remediation
of hydrocarbon vapours in the soil profile above
contaminated groundwater, natural ventilation of the
soil profile must not be impeded, since this will slow
biodegradation and the containment of vapours within
the vadose zone.
Conclusions
Except for the transport of benzene in groundwater, intrinsic
remediation by microbial populations prevents
the extensive transport of aromatic hydrocarbons in the
aquifer or the vadose zone on the Swan Coastal Plain.
This is consistent with the findings of many studies
conducted in many different aquifers.
The transport of benzene in the groundwater on
the Swan Coastal Plain is of concern, however addition
of oxygen or nitrate in the benzene plume could
be undertaken as a final remediation measure. It remains
unclear why benzene mineralisation can occur
under sulfate-reducing conditions in some aquifers
but not others. Although the fate of the aromatic
hydrocarbons, and the microbial processes involved
in their mineralisation can be inferred through geochemical
analysis and transport modeling, measurement
of microbial activities using radio-labeled compounds
increased our understanding of the processes
and potential rates of mineralisation of the pollutants.
The analysis of microbial populations through
phospholipid-derived signatures and biomass estimates
provided insight into the microbial populations
in the soil profile above hydrocarbon-contaminated
groundwater (Table 6), however signature analysis in
the contaminated groundwater plume provided little
useful information (Franzmann et al. 1996).
The use of fluorescently labelled polyclonal antibodies
for tracing specific bacterial strains of
Desulfosporosinus meridiei in the groundwater was
greatly superior to the use of rRNA-directed FISH
probes. The methodology for the application of FISH
is rapidly improving through the use of new dyes,
probes and image analysis techniques (Daims et al.
1999), however the successful use of FISH to describe
microbial communities in slow moving groundwaters
has not been demonstrated and will perhaps remain a
practical challenge for some time.
