Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of
highly lipophilic chemicals that are generally formed
during combustion, pyrolysis and pyrosynthesis of organic
matter and are present ubiquitously in the urban
environment as pollutants in very small quantities
(IARC Monograph, 1983, 1984 and 1985). In industrialised
countries, pollution by PAHs are primarily associated
with the processing, combustion and disposal of
fossil fuels (Bartha & Bossert, 1984). PAHs have also
been found in pre-industrial sediments (LaFlame &
Hires,1978) and are believed to be incomplete combustion
products from spontaneous fires involving grass
lands and forests, and some may be biogenic in origin
(Blumer, 1976). The more highly condensed PAH show
considerable persistence in the environment; the rates
and mechanism of their recycling are only partially
understood (Gibson & Subramanian,1984). There is little
information about the fate of PAH in the soil environment
and virtually nothing is known about mechanisms of
its biodegradation.
Of the many options available for the remediation of
waste sites, the use of microorganisms to degrade organic
chemicals offers many advantages in terms of speed,
efficiency and cost (Lee & Ward, 1985). Bioremediation
may involve the ability of the in situ microorganisms
to utilise the waste or the application of microorganisms
acclimated to degrade particular wastes or combinations
of wastes. Bioremediation has been used with
success to treat soils contaminated by hydrocarbon
products (Dibble & Bartha, 1979; Bossert et al., 1984).
In this study, the indigenous contaminated soil populations
were effective in removing the hydrocarbons and
returning the soil to productivity.
The objective of the present study was to determine the
activity of indigenous microbial (fungi and bacteria)
population of hazardous waste site, their degree of

adaptation, its ability to degrade toxic PAHs, and to
study the potentials of different indigenous microbes
to degrade the following selected PAHs from the polluted
soil environment. PAHs selected for the study were
1.Anthracene(An), 2.Phenanthrene(Ph), 3.Crysene(Cry),
4.Pyrene(Pyr) and 5. Flouranthene(F]).
MATERIALS AND
All PAH compounds and 1-phenyldecane were purchased
from Aldrich Chemical Co. with a purity of 98%. In
order to ensure uniform distribution of the hydrocarbons
in soil (Collected near the banks of the Musi
river which contains automobile, industrial and municipal
sewage waste), 25 mg of each PAH and 0.3 ml of ]-
phenyl decane were ground with 5g acid washed sand.
This mixture was thoroughly mixed with 30g fresh sandy
loam soil (Bartha & Bordeleau, 1969) equal to 25g by
dry wt. Replicate samples were prepared for each PAH
and individually placed in 100 ml glass beakers. Nitrogen
and phosphorus were adjusted in the samples to an
optimal C:N:P ratio (Dibble & Bartha, 1979) by adding a
NH4NO3/K2HPO 4 fertilization solution to provide
340 n moIes of N and 26 n moles of P per sample.
All samples were moistened to 50% of the soil water
holding capacity and the beakers covered with thin
polyethylene film to minimize evaporation. Samples were
incubated maintained at 27â€¢176 for a period of 15 mo.
During incubation the beakers were opened for a period
of 24 h. aeration in 3 day intervals and evaporated
water was replenished as needed to maintain conditions
favourable for biodegradation. Control samples for
determining abiotic PAHs losses were prepared in an
identical manner but contained 1% HgCl 2 on dry soil
basis.
After 5 mo. of incubation a second application of 0.3ml
of 1-phenyldecane was made to ensure the continued
availability of growth substrate for PAHs biodegradation.
On day 0 and each subsequent sampling point (5,
10 and 15 mo.) duplicate samples for each PAHs were
analysed for residues. After air drying of samples at
room temperature, they were exhaustively extracted by
using dichloromethane in a soxhlet apparatus. The
extracts were concentrated under pressure at 40~ and
care was taken to protect the extracts from prolonged
exposure to light.
Analysis for residual PAHs was performed by gas chromotography
with flame ionization detection (Hewlett
Packard 5710 A), using 183x0.31 cm stainless steel
column packed with 5% Dexsil on chromosorb W.(Applied
Science, Inc ) Carrier gas (N 2) flow 40 ml/min. Column
temperature for each PAH maintained (Anthracene-230~

Phenanthrene-220~ Cyrsene-280~ Pyrene-250~ and
Fluoranthene-280~ The detector temperature was 380~
for all PAHs, for ppm recovery (0.5 ul sample, attentuation
lx16).
Soil microflora (Fungi and Bacteria) were isolated
(0,5,10 and 15 mo), from the study samples, at different
time intervals during 15 mo incubation period.
Colony forming units (cfu) of soil microflora were
estimated by Waksmans serial dilution plate method
(Waksman, 1922) and soil plate method was used as a
complementary method for the estimation of soil microflora
(Warcup, 1957). Potato Sucrose Agar as well as

yeast extract-0.0059g, distilled wafer 1000ml and pH=7)
employed for the isolation of bacteria. Three replicates
were maintained in each case. Fungi and bacteria
which were dominant during the study were identified
down to species level.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The table-1 gives the details of biotic and abiotic
losses of PAH in soil during 15 mo. incubation period.
Anthracene and pyrene degradation enhanced as the
incubation period increases and crysene degradation is
almost nil.For the purpose of discussion biodegradation
assessed in these studies was measured as the loss of
parent PAH in the soil. This may include incorporation
into the soil humus, as well as mineralisation to CO~.
The table-2 summarises that cfu of fungi and bacterla
were increased as incubation period increases. The
dominant bacteria during the study were Pseudomonas
spp, Agrobacterium spp and the species of Bacillus
subtilis, whereas fungi dominated by Aspergillus
niger, A. flavus, Penicillium tordum, Fusarium
oxysporum, Sclerotium rolfsii, Trichoderma viride and
Trichoderma harzianum. In a previous pesticidal
treatment study (Mahmood et al 1989), Bacillus
subtilis, Sclerotium rolfsii and Trichoderma harzianum
were not reported. This may attribute to the PAH
presence and other physico-chemical environment of the
soils. Phenanthrene and anthracene were primarily lost
by microbial degradative processes, though substantial
aboitic losses contributed to their disappearance.
Phenanthrene was biodegraded faster than anthracene.
Although the angular ring arrangement of phenanthrene
is considered thermodynamically more stable than the
linear arrangement of anthracene (Blumer, 1976). The so
called "bay region" due to angular arrangement might
have favoured enzyme attack on PAH (Gibbson and Subramanian,
1984). The water solubility of phenanthrene

(1600 gL -I) as compared to anthracene (75 gL -I) might
have been contributed for the faster biodegradation of
phenanthrene. Here cfu of Sclerotium rolfsii and Trichoderma
harzianum were increased dramatically from 5
mo. onwards. On 15 mo. phenanthrene was not detected,
might be due to the trace level or possibilities of
experimental error. In the case of Pyrene Bacillus
subtilis might be dominating the degradation process,
because it was abundantly available during the process.
Anthracene and Fluoranthene degradation was dominated
by Agrobacterium spp. Pseudomonas spp, Aspergillus
terrus, A. flavus and Penicillium tordum. Crysene degradation
was not detected and the microbial numbers of
fungi as well as bacteria were parallel. No individual
microbe was dominated during the incubation period of
Crysene. Our present findings and the results of Bossert
and Bartha (1986) more or less confirm each other.
In conclusion the biodegradation of PAH in the selected
soil was due to PAH degrader present in the bacterial
as well as fungal communities. No other general rule
was applicable to all PAHs selected for the study.
In brief, hazardous waste contaminated soils possess
active population of soil micro-organisms, which in
this particular study are more abundant and more active
than adjacent non-contaminated soil. Abundance and
activity of microbial populations varies considerably
from site to site, and may be related to differences of
nutrient status or the presence of inhibitory chemicals.
It is proposed that PAH itself as well as other

effects on microbes with PAH degrading capabilities.
The observed heterogeneity will have to be taken into
consideration in implementing bioremediation of contaminated
soils.
