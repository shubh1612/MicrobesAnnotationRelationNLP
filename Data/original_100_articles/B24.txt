Summary
Enumeration of bacteria and recovery of the dominant species have been conducted for soils contaminated with fuel
spills for more than 10 years at seven gas stations in Jordan. Bacterial counts of these polluted soils ranged between
0.68 · 108 and 32.8 · 108 c.f.u./g soil with two different bacterial colony types recovered on agar plates. Phenotypic
examination of the recovered bacteria revealed that they belonged mainly to the genus Pseudomonas and was
represented by the following species: P. acidovorans, P. putrefaciens, P. cepacia, P. vesicularis and P. fluorescens. The
ability of these bacteria to grow on hexane or heptane was revealed by a colorimetric test. Action of five
Pseudomonas spp.: Pseudomonas putrefaciens, P. cepacia, P. acidovorans, P. vesicularis and P. fluorescens and
Rhodococcus erythropolis on 0.1% (v/v) hexane or heptane was followed at 1, 2, 6 and 12 h. Pseudomonas
putrefaciens, P. cepacia and P. acidovorans were capable of degrading both hydrocarbons as indicated by the yellow
colour formation (positive reaction); however, P. vesicularis and P. fluorescens showed no such capability.
Introduction
As a result of the increased use of automobiles, the
demand on gasoline/diesel stations is increasing. In such
stations, fuel oil, which is classified as hazardous waste
(Bartha & Bossert 1984) is spilled during transfer and
servicing operations. The accidental spillage of hydrocarbons
on the soil may result in a selective increase in
hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms (Venkateswaran
et al. 1995; Ferrari et al. 1996). The enhancement or
reduction will depend upon the chemical composition of
the contaminating hydrocarbons and on the species of
microorganism present within the microbial community
of the particular ecosystem (Atlas 1995). The distribution
of the type and the number of microorganisms at a
site may help to characterize the site with respect to the
concentration and age of the contaminant.
Alkanes are usually the easiest hydrocarbons to be
degraded by their conversion to alcohol via a mixed
function oxygenase activity (Sanger & Finnarty 1984).
Thus the detection of alcohol production would indicate
the potential of microorganisms to transform hydrocarbons.
Saadoun (2002) reported the ability of different
bacterial strains to degrade diesel fuel by transforming
the hydrocarbon to alcohol.
This paper describes the enumeration of bacteria and
recovery of the dominant species in soils polluted with
fuel oil spills at gas stations in Jordan. The ability of
different Pseudomonas spp. to transform short chain
alkanes to alcohol was also investigated.
Materials and methods
Collection of samples
Soil samples were collected from fuel oil-polluted soils
of seven gas stations in Jordan with a historic exposure
to fuel spills for more than 10 years. One sample of
250 g from each station was taken from the 10 cm top
soil, after discarding the upper 3 cm of the soil surface.
Sample processing
Each soil sample was crushed, thoroughly mixed then
sieved through a 2 mm pore size sieve (Retsch, Germany)
to get rid of large debris. Samples were placed in
polyethylene bags, closed tightly and stored in a
refrigerator prior to analysis. The sieved soil was then
used for the isolation purposes.
Isolation of bacteria
Subsamples of 1 g were suspended in 100 ml of sterile
distilled water, agitated in a water-bath shaker at
100 rev/min for 30 min, then serially diluted up to
10)6
. Aliquots of 0.1 ml from each dilution were spread
over the surface of nutrient agar (Himedia, India) plates.
Plates were incubated at 28 C for 2 days then total
bacterial count was detected.

Bacterial identification
The morphological characterization of each isolate was
first performed, including colour, size, and colony
characteristics (form, margin, and elevation). Gram
stain test was performed for each isolate and the ability
of some isolates to grow at 42 C was also investigated.
Bacterial strains were identified on the basis of Bergey’s
Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (Holt et al. 1994).
A culture of Rhodococcus erythropolis, was used as a
control reference capable of degrading different hydrocarbons
(Saadoun et al. 1999).
Biochemical tests
The following biochemical tests were used in the
bacterial isolates identification process: gelatin liquefaction;
citrate utilization; oxidase; catalase; growth at
6.5% sodium chloride; fluorescent pigment production;
indole formation and nitrate reduction (Cappuccino &
Sherman 1996). To determine glucose fermentation as
well as gas production, the isolates were placed in
phenol red–glucose broth.
Assay for hexane or heptane degradation
The test of Jacobs et al. (1983) was conducted to detect
the biodegradation of hexane or heptane by a monooxygenase
biodegradation pathway. The test is based
on the following reactions:
Ethanol þ nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ðNADþÞ
"# alcohol dehydrogenase
acetaldehyde þ NADþ þ Hþ
NADþ þ Hþ þ 2; 6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP)
[oxidized, blue]
"# 5-methylphenazinium methylsulphate (MPMS)
NADþ þ 2; 6-DCPIP [reduced, yellow]
The test was performed in duplicate at 28 C in a small
test tube containing the following components: 20 ll
2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) (ACROS organic,
NJ, USA), 50 mM; 30 ll 5-methyl-phenazinium
methylsulphate (5-MPMS) (ACROS organic, NJ,
USA), 50 mM; 25 ll of 0.1% (v/v) alkane (hexane or
heptane), 5 ll of 0.15 M NAD solution and 25 ll of
washed bacterial cells. Colour change was compared
visually with four controls. The first control contained
no hexane or heptane (substrate), the second contained
no NAD+ and the third contained no cells. A fourth
control consisted of heat-killed cells (10 min at 90 C).
The reaction was followed for 12 h and examined after
1, 2, 6 and 12 h.
Results
Bacterial population of soil samples polluted with
gasoline, diesel fuel and engine oils showed counts
ranging between 0.68 · 108 and 32.8 · 108 c.f.u./g soil
with two different colony types of bacterial strains which
have been recovered on the agar plates (Table 1).
The different bacterial genera (Pseudomonas, Micrococcus,
Corynebacterium, and Achromobacter) identified
in this study are shown in Table 1. There was higher
prevalence of the genus Pseudomonas than the other
genera. Table 2 shows five different Pseudomonas spp.
(Pseudomonas acidovorans, P. putrefaciens, P. cepacia,
P. vesicularis and P. fluorescens) that have been recovered
from soils contaminated with fuel oil spills.
The ability of the different Pseudomonas spp. to grow
on hexane or heptane is indicated by the colour change
at the end of the reaction time (Table 3). Action of five
Pseudomonas spp., Pseudomonas putrefaciens, P. cepacia,
P. acidovorans, P. vesicularis and P. fluorescens and
Rhodococcus erythropolis on 0.1% (v/v) hexane or
heptane was followed at 1, 2, 6 and 12 h. Pseudomonas
putrefaciens, P. cepacia and P. acidovorans were capable
of degrading both hydrocarbons as compared to the
action of R. erythropolis and as indicated by the yellow
colour formation (positive reaction); however, P. vesicularis
and P. fluorescens showed no capability.

of their activity in soils, it provides an indication of

Bacteria in oil-polluted soils and their degradation capabilities 45
the various oil-polluted Kuwaiti desert soil samples
subjected to various types of management. Rahman
et al. (2002) showed that bacteria are the most dominant
flora in gasoline and diesel station soils and Corynebacterium
was the predominant genus. However, the
recovered bacteria from soils contaminated with crude
petrolium oil as a result of transportation accidents
along the highway connecting Iraq and Jordan mainly
belonged to the genera Pseudomonas, Enterobacter and
Acinetobacter (Saadoun 2002).
The widespread distribution of members of the genus
Pseudomonas in all hydrocarbon-polluted soils of this
study as well as of the other investigations confirms their
prevalence and reflects their potential in utilizing these
hydrocarbon contaminants for growth and thus clean
these polluted sites (Cork & Krueger 1991). Therefore,
the different Pseudomonas spp. of this study were
evaluated for such potential using the modified method
of Jacobs et al. (1983) through transforming alkanes to
their corresponding alcohols. Detection of alcohol
formation by microorganisms may be an applicable
approach for evaluating their activity on the simple
alkanes. Saadoun (2002) reported that this technique
can be applied for screening of organisms for their
ability to degrade hydrocarbons.
