Abstract Nitrate-reducing bacteria of the recently recognized Azoarcus/Thauera group within the Betaproteobacteria contribute significantly to the biodegradation of
aromatic and other refractory compounds in anoxic waters
and soils. Strain EbN1 belongs to a distinct cluster (new
genus) and is the first member of this phylogenetic group,
the genome of which has been determined (4.7 Mb; one
chromosome, two plasmids) [Rabus R, Kube M, Heider J,
Beck A, Heitmann K, Widdel F, Reinhardt R (2005) The
genome sequence of an anaerobic aromatic-degrading denitrifying bacterium, strain EbN1. Arch Microbiol 183:
27–36]. Ten anaerobic and four aerobic aromatic-degradation pathways were recognized on the chromosome, with
the coding genes mostly forming clusters. Presence of paralogous gene clusters (e.g. for anaerobic ethylbenzene
degradation) suggests an even broader degradation spectrum than previously known. Metabolic versatility is also
reflected by the presence of multiple respiratory complexes
and is apparently controlled by an extensive regulatory
network. Strain EbN1 is unique for its capacity to degrade
toluene and ethylbenzene anaerobically via completely different pathways. Bioinformatical analysis of their genetic
blueprints and global expression analysis (DNA-microarray and proteomics) of substrate-adapted cells [Kühner

toluene and ethylbenzene pathways, respectively.

Introduction
Aromatic compounds belong to the most abundant organic
molecules in nature, e.g. alkylbenzenes (main constituents
of crude oil), phenolic compounds (important building
blocks of lignin) or aromatic amino acids (components of
proteins). Fuel-derived alkylbenzenes and phenolic compounds are also extensively used in chemical synthesis as
starting compounds or solvents. Anthropogenic release of
these toxic compounds during production, transport or
storage accidents is of major environmental concern and
therefore determines interest in their biodegradation
(Dejonghe et al. 2001). In addition, multiple compoundspecific enzymatic reactions could serve as biocatalysts in
industrial applications (Schmid et al. 2001; Wackett and
Hershberger 2001).
Due to the delocalized π-electron system, aromatic compounds display low chemical reactivity. In the case of alkylbenzenes, the absence of polar groups, i.e. the exclusive
presence of apolar C–C and C–H bonds, further increases
the chemical stability. Conversely, the biodegradation of
aromatic compounds requires special biochemical reactions. Under oxic conditions, reactive oxygen species (from
O2) are used in oxygenase-catalyzed reactions for initial
hydroxylation steps and hydrolytic cleavage of the aromatic
ring (Harayama et al. 1992; Gibson and Parales 2000).
Although these reactions have already been known for several decades, anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds
is a more recently discovered microbial capacity. Due to the
absence of molecular oxygen, many novel reactions are
involved, which have been discovered only during the past
decade studying newly isolated bacteria with the respective
anaerobic-degradation capacities (Heider and Fuchs 1997;
Widdel and Rabus 2001; Gibson and Harwood 2002). In
many cases, the aromatic compounds (polar or hydrocarbons) are channeled via specific reaction sequences to the
common intermediate benzoyl-CoA (Heider et al. 1998).
Subsequent degradation of the latter involves reductive dearomatization and hydrolytic ring cleavage (Boll et al.
2002; Harwood et al. 1999).
Stimulated by the observation of anaerobic degradation
of aromatic compounds in the natural environment or sam-

581

ples thereof (e.g. Kuhn et al. 1985; Smolenski and Suflita
1987), numerous pure cultures of novel bacteria were isolated, which could grow with aromatic compounds as the
only source of organic carbon in the absence of molecular
oxygen. Most of these isolates were denitrifying bacteria
belonging to the Azoarcus/Thauera group within the Betaproteobacteria (e.g. Anders et al. 1995; Widdel and Rabus
2001). This phylogenetic group consists of three distinct
clusters: (1) the denitrifying aromatic- and monoterpenedegrading Thauera spp., (2) the N2-fixing plant-associated
Azoarcus spp., which lack the capacity to anaerobically
degrade aromatic compounds (Rabus, unpublished data)

be proposed as an own genus (Rabus, unpublished data).
The significance of this phylogenetic group becomes evident from their wide geographical distribution (Zhou et al.
1995; Song et al. 1999; for overview, see Rabus 2005),
detection in oil-contaminated aquifers (Hess et al. 1997;
Pelz et al. 2001) and dominance in nitrate-reducing enrichment cultures utilizing alkylbenzenes and n-alkanes
from crude oil (Rabus et al. 1999). In fact, bioremediation

the addition of nitrate (Gersberg et al. 1993; Cunningham
et al. 2001).
Strain EbN1 was isolated from freshwater sediments
under nitrate-reducing conditions with ethylbenzene as the
sole source of organic carbon (Rabus and Widdel 1995). A
unique capacity of strain EbN1 is the anaerobic degradation of toluene in addition to ethylbenzene, also occurring
directly from crude oil (Rabus and Widdel 1996). The
different anaerobic degradation pathways for ethylbenzene
and toluene involve several novel biochemical reactions
[e.g. toluene is initially transformed to (R)-benzylsuccinate
and ethylbenzene to (S)-1-phenylethanol (Rabus and Heider
1998; Kniemeyer and Heider 2001a,b)] and converge at the
level of benzoyl-CoA. Both pathways are encoded in two
distinct gene clusters (Rabus et al. 2002; Kube et al. 2004)
and regulated by their respective substrates (Rabus and
Heider 1998; Champion et al. 1999; Kühner et al. 2005).
Strain EbN1 also degrades several polar aromatic compounds (e.g. phenylacetate and 4-hydroxybenzoate) and
aliphatic acids and ketones (e.g. acetone) anaerobically,
demonstrating its nutritional versatility (Rabus and Widdel
1995). The genome of strain EbN1 (Rabus et al. 2005) is the
first of a member of the Azoarcus/Thauera group and of an
anaerobic hydrocarbon degrader, and therefore forms an
important basis for future investigations into metabolic
diversity and evolution within this interesting phylogenetic
group.

Insights from the genome
Details about general genome features, cellular, metabolic
and other functions of strain EbN1 have been compiled in
an extensive documentation, which is publicly available at

the Web page http://www.micro-genomes.mpg.de/ebn1.
An integrated view of catabolic pathways and respiratory
energy conservation in strain EbN1 is presented in Fig. 1.
Comparative genomics
Although the genome of strain EbN1 is the first of an
anaerobic aromatic-degrading member of the Azoarcus/
Thauera group within the Betaproteobacteria (Rabus et al.
2005), genomes of aromatic-degraders (mainly aerobic)
from other proteobacterial subclasses are also known:
Pseudomonas putida (Gammaproteobacteria; Nelson et al.
2002) and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (Alphaproteobacteria; Larimer et al. 2004). A comparison of the general
genome features of these three Proteobacteria is presented
in Table 1.
P. putida is capable of aerobic degradation of 17
different aromatic compounds (e.g. phenylalanine and pcoumarate), which are channeled through four different
central oxygenase-dependent pathways via catechol, protocatechuate, phenylacetate and homogentisate. The gene
clusters for the peripheral and central pathways are spread
across most of the genome sequence (Jiménez et al. 2002).
The genome does not contain genes for the aerobic
degradation of toluene. However, in related P. putida mt2 (Williams and Murray 1974), the genes (xyl) for aerobic
degradation of toluene and xylenes are located on the wellstudied TOL-plasmid pWW0 (Greated et al. 2002). This is
contrasted by the chromosomal location of the genes for
anaerobic toluene and ethylbenzene degradation in strain
EbN1.
Anaerobic degradation of benzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate has been intensively studied in R. palustris (Egland

Four hundred and thirty-two conserved hypothetical and predicted novel proteins were differently categorized, e.g. when their formation

et al. 1997). However, the general importance of aerobic
biodegradation for this organism is evident from the
presence of four distinct oxygenase-dependent ring-cleavage systems and a total of 19 mono- and dioxygenases. The
genes for these degradation enzymes are distributed across the genome. Reflecting the different metabolic types
(chemo-, photo-, hetero- and autotrophic), R. palustris contains a vast array (>500) of predicted regulatory proteins
(Larimer et al. 2004).
Strain EbN1 contains an unusually high number of
unique genes (23% of the chromosomal genes) as compared to R. palustris (>9%) and P. putida (11%). The exceptional position of strain EbN1 with respect to the share
of unique genes is also reflected by the rather low percentage (60%) of genes that could be assigned to a COG
category, considering that 61–99% values are usually observed among Proteobacteria (Tatusov et al. 2003). Genes
for special pathways for anaerobic degradation of aromatic
compounds characterizing strain EbN1 and its close relatives, such as Azoarcus evansii (e.g. Harwood et al. 1999)
and Thauera aromatica (Leuthner et al. 1998; Breinig et al.
2000), are not present in the genomes of the aerobic
degraders.
Catabolic versatility
More than a dozen gene clusters for anaerobic aromatic
degradation were identified across the chromosome of
strain EbN1 (Fig. 1; Rabus et al. 2005), which is in accordance with the range of aromatic compounds previously demonstrated to support anaerobic growth (Rabus and
Widdel 1995). Surprisingly, the chromosome also contained gene clusters for anaerobic degradation of 2aminobenzoate p-cresol and phenol. In the latter case, a
novel phosphotransferase is involved as recently demonstrated for related T. aromatica (Schmeling et al. 2004).
Subsequent experiments confirmed that strain EbN1 could
indeed grow with these 3 aromatic compounds under
anaerobic conditions. In addition, paralogous gene clusters
were discovered for the anaerobic degradation of ethylbenzene (Fig. 2), p-cresol and benzoate. The products of
the second gene copies display the following markedly
reduced sequence identities: 47.2–83.5% in the case of
ethylbenzene dehydrogenase subunits and (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase (Fig. 2), 33 and 43% in the case of
p-cresol methylhydroxylase subunits (PchCF) and 77.9
and 90.0% in the case of the catalytic subunits of benzoylCoA reductase (BcrBC). These deviations in sequence
identity suggest that the enzymes encoded by the second
gene copies probably have a different, yet-to-be-defined
substrate specificity. Nine of the ten recognized anaerobic
peripheral pathways of aromatic compounds are channeled
to benzoyl-CoA (Fig. 1), the well-known central intermediate in anaerobic aromatic degradation (Boll et al. 2002).
The only exception is anaerobic 3-hydroxybenzoate degradation, with strain EbN1 apparently recruiting a paralogous benzoyl-CoA reductase in contrast to T. aromatica
(Laempe et al. 2001).

Five gene clusters for aerobic degradation of aromatic
compounds are present in the genome, which encode the
enzymes for four different aerobic routes (Fig. 1). The
capacity to degrade 2-aminobenzoate and gentisate was
first recognized by genome analysis and subsequently
confirmed with growth experiments. The aerobic aromatic
catabolism also involves unusual pathways and novel oxygenases. As recently elucidated in related A. evansii (Zaar
et al. 2004), aerobic degradation of benzoate requires activation to the CoA-ester, followed by formation of a cisdihydrodiol intermediate by means of a novel NADH- and
O2-dependent benzoyl-CoA dioxygenase. Paralogous genes
for aerobic degradation of salicylate and phenylacetate are
present on the chromosome. Thus, in the case of anaerobic
and aerobic degradation, mining of the genome sequence
revealed that the spectrum of aromatic compounds
supporting growth is considerably broader than previously
thought. Overall, more than 150 genes are apparently
devoted to the catabolism of aromatic compounds, corroborating their importance for the nutrition of strain EbN1.
In addition, strain EbN1 utilizes several non-aromatic
compounds. Ketones (acetone and 2-butanone; Rabus and
Widdel 1995) are metabolized using a carboxylase which is
similar to the well-studied enzyme of Xanthobacter autotrophicus (Sluis et al. 2002) and different from the acetophenone carboxylase. The presence of more than 140
genes for enzymes of β-oxidation and alcohol dehydrogenases (e.g. 32 predicted short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases) emphasizes the potential of strain EbN1 to utilize

Fig. 2 Paralogous genes for anaerobic ethylbenzene degradation. a
Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase (EbdABC) oxidizes ethylbenzene stereospecifically to (S)-1-phenylethanol. The catalytic subunit EbdA
carries a molybdenum cofactor, and EbdD probably functions as
“private” chaperon for EbdABC maturation. The secondary alcohol
is then oxidized by (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase (Ped) to
acetophenone. b The initially identified genes of these enzymes are
shown in the top panel (Rabus et al. 2002, 2005), the paralogous
genes below (Rabus et al. 2005). The chromosomal location of the

organic acids and alcohols. Most organic substrates of
strain EbN1 are degraded directly via their respective anaerobic or aerobic pathways to acetyl-CoA. In the case of
propionate (substrate or intermediate in the degradation of
2-butanone and odd-chained fatty acids, respectively), this
is achieved via the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway. The
TCA-cycle is then used for complete oxidation of acetylCoA to CO2. Intermediates of the TCA-cycle used for
gluconeogenesis or amino acid biosynthesis are replenished by channeling acetyl-CoA units into the glyoxylate
shunt. An integrated view of the different catabolic routes in
strain EbN1 is presented in Fig. 1.
Respiratory flexibility
Strain EbN1 conserves energy by respiration of oxygen
or nitrate (denitrification). Although the denitrification system is highly similar to that of other denitrifiers (Zumft
1997), NADH-regenerating complexes and terminal oxidases (oxygen-reducing) show an unexpected variety. A
proton-translocating NADH-dehydrogenase (Nuo) and a
non-proton-translocating isoenzyme (Ndh) provide flexibility with respect to rate and efficiency of energy conservation (Unden et al. 2002). In addition, proton-translocating
NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductases (Rnf, two copies) may
enable reverse electron transfer (Kumagai et al. 1997). The
presence of terminal oxidases with different affinities towards oxygen suggests that strain EbN1 is capable of
efficient oxygen respiration at varying external oxygen
concentrations. Due to its low oxygen affinity, the protontranslocating cytochrome aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase
(four copies) probably operates at high oxygen concentrations. The high oxygen affinities of the cytochrome cbb3type cytochrome c oxidase (two copies) and the cytochrome
bd-type quinol oxidase qualify them for micro-oxygen
conditions (Pitcher et al. 2002).
Regulatory potential
The broad catabolic and respiratory versatility of strain
EbN1 is also reflected in a multi-component regulatory
network (120 genes for DNA-binding regulatory proteins
and genes for at least 30 two-component regulatory systems), acting at different hierarchical levels. Control of
individual catabolic gene clusters in response to substrate
availability can be mediated by specific regulators for the
respective substrates. For example, two-component regulatory systems are responsive towards substrates like nitrate (NarXL) or alkylbenzenes (TdiSR, see below) and act
as transcriptional activators. In related Azoarcus sp. strain
CIB, expression of the bzd operon for anaerobic benzoate
degradation is controlled by the repressor BzdR and the
inductor benzoyl-CoA (Barragán et al. 2005). Superimposed regulatory circuits could coordinate the obligatory
anaerobic degradation pathways (e.g. toluene) and the various respiratory modes with the actual redox conditions in
the environment (e.g. fumarate nitrate reductase regulator)

or direct metabolism in favour of preferential substrates
(e.g. cAMP receptor protein) (Körner et al. 2003). Overall, this regulatory network could enable strain EbN1 to
efficiently adapt its metabolism to changing substrate
concentrations.
Metabolic evolution
Enzymes of individual degradative pathways in strain
EbN1 show similar degrees of conservation to orthologs
from bacteria with different degrees of phylogenetic relatedness to strain EbN1, e.g. closely related A. evansii in
the case of anaerobic benzoate degradation and more distantly related T. aromatica in the case of anaerobic toluene
or phenol degradation. This observation suggested that
lateral gene transfer (LGT) played an essential role in the
metabolic evolution of strain EbN1. Such a scenario is
supported by the exceptionally high number (237) of transposon-related genes in the 4.7 Mb genome of strain EbN1
(50/Mb). For comparison, the 6.2-Mb genome of the aerobic aromatic-degrader P. putida, which is also assumed to
have acquired catabolic genes via LGT, contains 96 transposon-related genes (15/Mb) (Nelson et al. 2002). Further
support for LGT in strain EbN1 comes from the observation that one plasmid contains several catabolic genes and
the assumption that mobile genetic elements are maintained by toxin/antitoxin proteins of the various “addiction” systems (Hayes 2003) detected at several places in the
genome. One may even speculate that LGT also contributed to shaping the catabolically unique properties of the
many other “degraders” in the Azoarcus/Thauera group.
Ecophysiological distinction
Strain EbN1 belongs to a cluster of more than a dozen
denitrifying “degradation-specialists”, including A. evansii
(aromatic-degrading), strain pCyN1 (aromatic- and monoterpene-degrading) and strain HxN1 (n-alkane-degrading),
which have all been isolated from soil and freshwater
sediments. This cluster is closely related to the Azoarcus
spp. (sensu stricto), which are characterized by a N2-fixing,
plant-endosymbiotic lifestyle (Reinhold-Hurek and Hurek
2000). Association of the bacteria with the rhizosphere of
rice plants is mediated by adhesins on the cell surface of the
Azoarcus spp. (Dörr et al. 1998). Such genes for nitrogenase and adhesins are absent in the genome of strain EbN1.
Thus, strain EbN1 can be regarded as a free-living soil
bacterium specializing on the anaerobic degradation of recalcitrant compounds, which ecophysiologically separates
this bacterium from the plant-associated Azoarcus spp.

Regulation of anaerobic alkylbenzene degradation
Strain EbN1 is to date the only known organism that can
degrade toluene and ethylbenzene under anoxic conditions.
Despite their structural similarity, the two alkylbenzenes

585

are degraded via two fundamentally different anaerobic
pathways that converge at the level of benzoyl-CoA.
Toluene is initially added in a radical reaction to fumarate
forming (R)-benzylsuccinate as the first intermediate. (R)Benzylsuccinate is subsequently activated to the CoA-ester
and converted to benzoyl-CoA via a modified β-oxidation
reaction sequence. In contrast, ethylbenzene is directly
oxidized at the methylene carbon via (S)-1-phenylethanol
to acetophenone. The latter is carboxylated to benzoylacetate, and thiolytic removal of an acetyl-CoA moiety yields
benzoyl-CoA.
Earlier enzymatic and physiological studies already
pointed to a substrate-dependent regulation of the two
pathways (Rabus and Heider 1998; Champion et al. 1999).
The recent elucidation of the complete genetic blueprints
for both pathways (Rabus et al. 2002; Kube et al. 2004)
allowed the study of this regulatory process on a global
level using a pathway-specific DNA microarray and proteomics (Kühner et al. 2005). Integration of computational and experimental data led to the following regulatory
model (Fig. 3): (1) Recognition of toluene, ethylbenzene
and acetophenone is mediated by three different two-component regulatory systems (TdiSR, Tcs2/Tcr2 and Tcs1/
Tcr1, respectively). Whereas TdiSR appears to be strictly
specific for toluene, the other two have a relaxed substrate
specificity being also responsive to toluene. (2) The bss
(benzylsuccinate synthase encoding) and bbs (β-oxidation
enzymes encoding) operons of anaerobic toluene degradation are coordinately controlled by the TdiSR system. A
role of benzylsuccinate as inductor for the expression of the
toluene genes (Coschigano and Bishop 2004) appears unlikely in strain EbN1. (3) In contrast, the upper (from
ethylbenzene to acetophenone; ebd/ped operon) and lower
(from acetophenone to benzoyl-CoA; apc/bal operon) parts
of the ethylbenzene pathway are sequentially regulated
according to the presence of the respective substrates.
Similarly, in P. putida the expression of the upper and lower
operons for the aerobic degradation of toluene/xylenes via
(methyl)benzoates to acetyl-CoA is regulated in response
to the presence of the respective substrates (Ramos et al.
1997). (4) Simultaneous utilization of toluene and ethylbenzene is paralleled by the simultaneous expression of the
corresponding genes, demonstrating that neither of the two
alkylbenzenes is regarded as a preferred substrate.
In addition, the global expression analysis revealed the
co-regulation of several thus-far-unknown genes (located
in separate transcriptional units) during the degradation of
both alkylbenzenes, indicating that more proteins than
currently known could be involved (Kühner et al. 2005).

Biochemistry
To date, investigations on the biochemistry of individual
enzymes in strain EbN1 have been focused on those involved in anaerobic ethylbenzene degradation and were
performed by the group of Johann Heider. Ethylbenzene
dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the initial oxidation of ethylbenzene to (S)-1-phenylethanol, is a heterotrimeric mo-

lybdenum/iron-sulfur/heme-containing enzyme (Kniemeyer
and Heider 2001a). A highly similar enzyme was also
studied in the closely related denitrifier strain EB1 (Johnson
et al. 2001). It represents the first enzyme demonstrated
to oxidize a hydrocarbon under anoxic conditions. The
periplasmic location of the enzyme was confirmed by the
twin-arginine-containing leader peptide directing export
of the mature protein via the TAT-system. Maturation of
the enzyme is apparently assisted by a private chaperon
(Rabus et al. 2002). The second reaction from (S)-1phenylethanol to acetophenone is catalyzed by a NAD+dependent, stereospecific dehydrogenase (Kniemeyer and
Heider 2001b). Genetic evidence (Rabus et al. 2002) sug-

gests that the subsequent acetophenone carboxylase is distinct from the known acetone carboxylase (Sluis et al.
2002).

Perspectives
Application of the established functional genomic approach (Kühner et al. 2005) to the entire range of aromatic
substrates (anaerobic and aerobic) of strain EbN1 will aim
at defining the individual elements of the regulatory network and to decipher the mechanisms of adaptation to
fluctuating availability of organic substrates and electron
acceptors in the environment on the “true” organism level.
In addition, identification of new protein components of the
individual degradation pathways can be expected. Overall,
strain EbN1 could be used as a model system and starting
point to expand our understanding of the intriguing
catabolic diversity and its evolution in the phylogenetic
cluster of strain EbN1. Besides their genetic/biochemical
novelty, some of these reactions may be used as novel
resources for biocatalysis in industrial synthetic chemistry.
A comparison of the genomes of strain EbN1 and Azoarcus
sp. strain BH72, a model for diazotrophic grass endophytes
(Hurek and Reinhold-Hurek 2003), promises to provide
new insights into the mechanisms involved in the transition
of a free-living soil bacterium to an endophyte. Habitatorientated research may assess the global distribution of the
novel degradation pathways. A recent metagenomic investigation of a microbial mat from the anoxic seafloor of
the Black Sea revealed a DNA fragment (79 kb) that contained the complete genetic blueprints of anaerobic benzoate and hydroxybenzoate degradation as known from
strain EbN1 and its relatives (Kube et al. 2005).
