Abstract
This study investigates the inﬂuence of petroleum hydrocarbons on a microbial community in the vadose zone under ﬁeld
conditions. An artiﬁcial hydrocarbon mixture consisting of volatile and semi-volatile compounds similar to jet-fuel was emplaced in
a previously uncontaminated vadose zone in nutrient-poor glacial melt water sand. The experiment included monitoring of microbial parameters and CO2 concentrations in soil gas over 3 months in and outside the hydrocarbon vapor plume that formed
around the buried petroleum. Microbial and chemical analyses of soil and vadose zone samples were performed on samples from
cores drilled to 3.3 m depth on three dates and three lateral distances from the buried petroleum mass. Signiﬁcantly elevated CO2
concentrations were observed after contamination. Total cell numbers as determined by ﬂuorescence microscopy were strongly
correlated with soil organic carbon and nitrogen content but varied little with contamination. Redundancy analysis (RDA) allowed
direct analysis of eﬀects of selected environmental variables or the artiﬁcial contamination on microbiological parameters. Variation
in biomass and CO2 production was explained by soil parameters, to 46%, and by the duration of contamination, to 39.8%. The
microbial community structure was assessed by community level physiological proﬁles (CLPP) analysis using BiologTM Eco-Plates.
In the CLPP data only 35.9% of the variation could be linked to soil parameters and contamination, however, the samples with
greatest exposure to hydrocarbons grouped together on RDA plots. It is concluded that, at this nutrient-poor site, the microbial
community was dominated by natural heterogeneity and that the inﬂuence of petroleum hydrocarbon vapors was weak.

problem. In situ bioremediation [1] for a cost-eﬀective
environmentally friendly cleanup and monitored natural
attenuation [2] for risk management are two frequently
applied strategies to cope with petroleum spills. Both
rely on the potential of the autochthonous microbial
communities to biodegrade petroleum hydrocarbons,
which is supposed to be ubiquitous in oxic environments
[3]. The addition of hydrocarbon-degrading microbes is
usually not more eﬀective for hydrocarbon removal than
stimulating the growth of the indigenous microorganisms, and indeed, inoculation is usually not practiced. A

central question at polluted sites undergoing enhanced
in situ bioremediation or natural attenuation is therefore
the impact of petroleum contamination on the activity
and on the structure of the indigenous microbial communities in the subsurface. Previous work, e.g. [4–7],
focused on the bioremediation of petroleum-contaminated topsoils, covering microbiological, chemical and
engineering aspects. The eﬀects of petroleum pollution
on terrestrial microbial communities have been studied
at diﬀerent experimental scales: in enrichment cultures
[8], microcosm experiments [9,10], soil columns [11],
lysimeters [12,13] and ﬁeld plots or transects [5,14,15].
Various methods such as community level physiological
proﬁles (CLPP) [4,16,17], phospholipid fatty acid
(PLFA) proﬁling [5,10] and nucleic acid-based methods
[15,18–20] have been used to study the composition of
the microbial communities. Widmer and coworkers [21]
applied three diﬀerent methods (CLPP using Biolog GN
plates, PLFA and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis) to evaluate the community
structure in three diﬀerent non-polluted agricultural
soils. All three methods allowed distinguishing the soils
based on ﬁngerprints. After contamination of pristine
soil with petroleum, an increase in microbial activity,
but a decrease in diversity, is generally observed (see [8–
15]). However, most studies with artiﬁcially polluted
soils were performed in the laboratory, and signiﬁcant
eﬀects on the activity and composition of the microbial
communities in controls without contamination were
also observed, as a result of the incubation process
[10,22]. Thus, the transferability of long-term laboratory
studies to the ﬁeld situation is often questionable. It can
be concluded that the best way to exclude incubation
bias is to work in situ.
The unsaturated or vadose zone is a fairly unknown
compartment of the soil ecosystem [23]. Before the1970s
a general agreement on a sterile or sparsely populated
subsurface prevailed [24]. Since then, studies characterizing the microbial communities of deeper vadose zones
between topsoil and groundwater were primarily focused on the inﬂuence of the water potential on the
abundance and activity of microbial organisms (see [23]
for review). Consistently with lower carbon and nutrient
ﬂuxes, as compared to aquifers and topsoil layers, microbial activity and diversity is lower in the intermediate
unsaturated zone. At a pristine site in Oklahoma with an
unsaturated zone of 3 m thickness [25], biomass and
substrate-induced activity of bacteria and protozoa were
constant in summer and winter, but varied sharply with
depth, with a minimum in the deep unsaturated zone
above the capillary fringe. In a pristine unsaturated zone
of 26 m thickness in the US Midwest, the lowest biomass
and smaller biodegradation rates of glucose and phenol
were found in unsaturated tills as compared with both
topsoil and the deeper saturated zone [26]. Only a few
ﬁeld studies [14,27] report on microbial populations in

vadose zones at petroleum spill sites. In most studies the
petroleum is ﬂoating on the groundwater and investigations were limited to the deep vadose and the saturated zone. The signiﬁcance of the vadose zone for
petroleum biodegradation remains unclear and better
characterization is needed at contaminated sites. Pasteris et al. [28] performed a lysimeter experiment simulating an unsaturated zone above a groundwater table
using pristine alluvial sand as a porous medium. The
CO2 concentration in the soil increased the day after
addition of petroleum hydrocarbons and was linked to
aerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons and growth of
microbial biomass. Hence, the microbial community in
the sand adapted within a short time to petroleum and
biodegradation started rapidly. However, the unsaturated alluvial sand had been disturbed physically during
ﬁlling of the lysimeter, potentially activating the microbial community before contamination.
The main aim of this study was to monitor the activity and structure of an indigenous microbial community in a 3.3 m deep natural sandy unsaturated soil
before and after artiﬁcial contamination with petroleum
hydrocarbons. BiologTM EcoPlates results were used
together with redundancy analysis (RDA) in order to
test the relationship between functional diversity (using
the term as deﬁned in [29]) and site-speciﬁc variables.
Detailed results on hydrocarbon migration were measured by P. Kjeldsen et al. (Technical University of
Denmark, unpublished data).

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental site and contamination
The ﬁeld experiment was conducted from July 2001
to July 2002 at the site of the European project GRACOS at Airbase Vrløse in Denmark, which is a location without prior contamination by petroleum
products. At this site, a sandy dark brown topsoil of
0.3–0.5 m thickness is overlaying 2.0–3.3 m of homogeneous glacial melt-water sand, which in turn overlays
0.5–1.0 m of moraine sand/gravel, having visible white
lime. An unconﬁned aquifer was found in July 2001 at a
depth of 3.3 m. The water table was shown to rise between 1.2 and 1.6 m during wet winters. The site was
covered with grass and had not been fertilized over the
course of at least 50 years.
An artiﬁcial petroleum hydrocarbon mixture of 13
typical kerosene hydrocarbons (Table 1) was composed
from pure products, to which the chloroﬂuorocarbon
1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-triﬂuoroethane (CFC-113) was added as a conservative volatile tracer. To form a source of
hydrocarbons, 10.2 liters of this mixture was mixed with
about 200 liters of sand from the site and buried at a
depth of 0.8 to 1.3 m below the surface in a round hole

of 0.70 m diameter. After ﬁlling the rest of the hole with
the original soil material, a lid of 1.24 m diameter was
installed 0.3 m above ground in order to prevent direct
rainwater inﬁltration into the buried source. The migration of hydrocarbon vapors and the composition of
the soil gas were monitored with high spatial and temporal resolution for the subsequent 12 months after
contamination. Stainless steel capillaries (1/16 in.) were
installed in the experimental area before kerosene source
installation (Fig. 1). The compounds in the pore-gas
were sampled on sorbent tubes packed with TenaxÒ and
analyzed by automated thermal desorption to a gas
chromatograph with ﬂame ionization and electron capture detection (ATD-GC-FID and -ECD). Soil gas and
groundwater were sampled along a main sampling axis
within 20 m from the source center. The groundwater
ﬂow direction, determined before the experiment, deﬁned the main sampling axis (Fig. 1). Hydrocarbon data
measured along this main axis and along three secondary axes (90°, 180° and 270° to the main axis) showed
that vapor migration was generally isotropic. The soil
temperature was measured with ﬁxed installed thermometers to a depth of 2.5 m.

389

At sampling distances of 0.7 (samples A, D and G), 2
(B, E and H) and 10 m (C, F and I) from the source
center (for the spatial arrangement of coring sites see
Fig. 1), three soil cores were sampled on three diﬀerent
days. Soil cores A–C were taken on the 24th day before contamination, soil cores D–F and cores G–I on
the 23rd and 80th day after contamination of the site,
respectively.
The soil cores D, E, G and H were taken within the
vapor plume. Microbial populations in these cores had
been more or less steadily exposed to hydrocarbon vapors for about 20 days (cores D + E) and 77 days (cores
G + H). At 10 m from the source, most hydrocarbons
were at all times below the detection limits, except nhexane, isooctane, cyclopentane, methylcyclopentane,
methylcyclohexane and 3-methylpentane which were
detected in traces between day 13 and 17. Therefore, the
microbial populations in samples from the soil cores F
and I can be viewed as uninﬂuenced by petroleum hydrocarbons, in addition to those of soil cores A–C taken
prior to contamination. A maximum petroleum vapor
mass in the soil pore air of 450 g was reached after 17
days and then decreased to 2 g on day 350. The vapor
concentrations of individual components generally decreased three orders of magnitude within 2–8 m lateral
distance from the buried source. Only after 113 days did
the most volatile compounds (cyclopentane, 3-methylpentane and methylcyclopentane) disappear completely
from the vadose zone at 2 m distance from the source
center and some compounds persisted at the site for
more than one year.
2.2. Soil sampling
In order to avoid any disturbance of the soil by the
installed gas or water sampling devices, soil samples
were taken only at locations outside the buried petroleum and along an axis at an angle of 120–140° to the
main sampling axis. Soil cores were taken using a
stainless steel hollow-stem soil corer of 2.8 cm diameter

Fig. 1. Cross-section of ﬁeld site, with location of kerosene source (black square), soil gas sampling ports along the main sampling axis (black circles)
and location of soil cores drilled along an axis of 120–140° to the main sampling axis (grey dots). Soil cores A–C were taken on the 24th day before
contamination, soil cores D–F and cores G–I on the 23rd and 80th day after contamination of the site, respectively, at distances of 0.7 (samples A, D
and G), 2 (B, E and H) and 10 m (C, F and I) from the source center.

(LB system, Geoprobe, Salina, Kansas). The corer was
driven into the ground by a motor hammer until the
moraine gravel made further lowering impossible. Undisturbed samples were obtained in PVC liners of 60 cm
length. The top 10–15 cm in each liner were discarded to
exclude topsoil, which had fallen into the hole. Soil
samples were transferred on site into sterile PE tubes
and stored at soil temperature (15  3 °C) for a maximum of 3 days before they were homogenized, sieved
(<2 mm) and further analyzed. After coring, each remaining hole was ﬁlled with clean sand and bentonite.
2.3. Carbon dioxide and oxygen measurements
Soil gas for the measurement of oxygen and carbon
dioxide was sampled at 107 gas sampling tubes represented as black circles in Fig. 1. These probes were
purged of dead air before samples of 3 ml were withdrawn with a syringe. The gas samples were stored in
evacuated blood collection tubes (Venoject tubes, Terumo, Leuven, Belgium) and analyzed using a portable
Chrompack Micro GC (Middelburg, The Netherlands).
The method has been previously described in [30]. Since
the sampling days for CO2 and O2 did not correspond to
the sampling days of the soil cores, adjustment was allowed for gas data by linearly interpolating between
consecutive dates. Linear interpolation was considered
accurate enough since the delay between gas sampling
days and the core drilling never exceeded more than 3%
of the total duration of the experiment. For the depths of
the samples A10, A11, A12, D10 and G10, no CO2 values were available. Average values of the corresponding
samples were used for statistical analysis instead. Contour plots were drawn with Surfer 7.00 (Golden Software
Inc., Colorado, USA) using Kriging for interpolation.
2.4. General soil characteristics
Soil pH (free acidity) was measured in H2 O (soil to
water ratio 1:2.5 w/w) after shaking for 1 h. All soil
samples were ground, mineralized by the method of
Kjeldahl and analyzed colorimetrically for total nitrogen (Ntot ) and phosphorus (Ptot ) on a Technicon Autoanalyzer II (Dublin, Ireland). Total soil carbon was
combusted at 1000 °C to CO2 which was analyzed on a
CASUMAT analyzer (W€
ostmann, Bochum, Germany).
The CO2 release from soil boiled in 33% phosphoric acid
was measured in order to get the total inorganic carbon
content and the total organic carbon (TOC) content was
calculated by subtracting the inorganic carbon content,
from the total carbon content. The temperature proﬁles
in the soil were measured on selected days at 4 p.m. with
buried thermometers. Missing values were interpolated
from the closest measurements. Water content was
measured by weight loss due to evaporation after 24 h at
105 °C.

2.5. Direct counts of soil bacteria
For enumeration of total bacteria, the <2 mm sieved
fraction of 0.3 g of each soil sample was suspended in 4%
paraformaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buﬀered saline (0.13 M NaCl, 7 mM Na2 HPO4 and 3 mM
NaH2 PO4 , pH 7.2) and stored in 96% EtOH at )20 °C
[14]. The suspensions were then diluted between two- and
tenfold (depending on cell density) in pyrophosphate
buﬀer (0.1% Na4 P2 O7  10 H2 O), and ultrasonicated to
disrupt bioﬁlms and permeabilize cell membranes. Three
times 20 ll of the dispersed suspension were spotted on
gelatin-coated slides dried on heating plates at 70 °C and
ﬁnally dehydrated sequentially in 50%, 80% and 96%
ethanol for 3 min each. The dry samples were stained for
10 min with an aqueous mixture of 40 ,60 -diamidino2-phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI, 5 lg ml1 ) and
acridine orange (AO, 0.001%), dried again, covered with
a drop of citiﬂuor AF1 (Citiﬂuor Ltd., London, UK) and
a cover slip and stored at )20 °C. Bacteria were counted
with a microscope (Olympus BX-60, Olympus Optical
Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) equipped for epiﬂuorescence.
Staining with a DAPI/AO mixture allowed easy distinction between orange-stained soil particles and bluestained bacteria. Cell counts are average cell numbers of
16 equally distributed ﬁelds on a microscope slide. Averages and standard deviations presented in Fig. 3 were
calculated from three of these measurements based on 16
ﬁelds.
2.6. Protein quantiﬁcation in soil samples after Bradford
Protein was quantiﬁed in order to test the correlation
between total cell numbers and microbial biomass. To
prepare 1 l of Bradford Reagent, 100 mg of Coomassie
brilliant blue G-250 was dissolved in 50 ml ethanol
(96%). Deionized, ﬁltered H2 O and 100 ml H3 PO4 (85%)
were added to give a volume of 1000 ml. Protein standards in the range of 0.5–0.005 mg ml1 were prepared
from a stock solution of 1 mg bovine serum albumin
(BSA) per ml. Sieving soil samples (<2 mm) allowed to
separate roots and worms from the soil before protein
analysis. One ml of 1 M NaOH was added to 1.5 g
sample soil and cooked for 10 min at 95 °C [14]. The soil
particles were subsequently settled by centrifugation (5
min at 4000 rpm). After chilling, 0.5 ml of the supernatant was neutralized by addition of 1 M HCl (sterile,
ﬁltered) in a new tube. The OD590 was measured after
incubation for 5 min with Bradford reagent. Particles
and dissolved material were accounted for by a blank
for each sample. Since the pH was lowered to 1 by addition of the Bradford reagent to the sample, some soil
material was dissolved. To have the same conditions in
the blank and in the sample, a solution prepared identically to Bradford reagent without Coomassie brilliant
blue was added.

2.7. Characterization of community-level physiological
proﬁles
Microorganisms for physiological proﬁles were extracted by shaking 30 g soil for 30 min in 75 ml sterile
deionized water at 180 rpm on a rotary shaker. Deionized water was chosen since, according to the DLVO
(Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek) theory of
colloid stability, low ion concentration favors detachment of particles from surfaces [31]. The samples were
allowed to settle for 10 min. Ten ml suspensions were
put on ice until used. To estimate inoculated cell numbers and extraction eﬃciency, 100 ll of the suspension
was stained by 20 ll of a DAPI/AO mixture described
above, ﬁltered and dried in ethanol on a polycarbonate
ﬁlter. Extracted and inoculated cell numbers were determined by ﬂuorescence microscopy. The extraction
eﬃciency of 18–80%, expressed as percentage of total
count cell numbers, strongly depended inversely on the
organic matter content. CLPP were obtained from all
samples of cores A, D and G, and from a few selected
samples of the remaining cores taken at the depth of the
buried source.
BiologTM EcoPlates (Biolog Inc., Hayward, CA,
USA) [32] are commercially manufactured microtiter
plates loaded with mineral medium, a tetrazolium dye
and 31 diﬀerent carbon sources in triplicates. CLPP are
based on reduction of the dye linked to carbon source
utilization in the wells of those plates [33]. None of the
carbon sources is a fuel compound or expected to occur
signiﬁcantly in hydrocarbon-polluted soils due to contamination. By means of a 8-channel pipette, one plate
per sample depth was inoculated with 125 ll per well of
the 1:100 (topsoil) or 1:19 diluted extract. Plate incubation occurred at steady temperature of 21 °C in the
dark, absorption was automatically measured at 595 nm
every 12 h with a plate reader (Dynex Technologies Inc.
MRX II, Chantilly, USA). Values of the respective
blanks were subtracted and negative values that occasionally resulted were set to zero. Average well color
development (AWCD) was calculated for each well but
not used for further data transformation for reasons
described in the results section. Values after 72 h incubation and absorbance areas under curves to 120 h were
used for further analysis. The areas were obtained by
calculating a ‘Riemann’s sum’ as also suggested in [34].
The substrate richness, S, is the total number of utilized
C-sources out of 31 and utilization being ascribed to
absorbance values of samples minus absorbance of
blanks exceeding 0.25 after 72 h. A coeﬃcient of variation (CV) was introduced in order to gain information
on the reliability of the mean values of the three substrate replicates on one plate. The percentages of all 31
plate substrates with a CV ¼ r=l (r being the standard
deviation and l the mean value of the three replicates)
smaller than 100% are listed in Table 3.

391

2.8. Statistical treatment of data
The whole data set of 33 objects/samples was subdivided in ﬁve ﬁles according to the variables: ‘Biolog 72h’
(absorption after 72 h: 31 quantitative variables), ‘Biolog area 120h (areas under absorbance curves after 120
h: 31 quantitative variables), ‘Biology data’ (CO2 concentration log of cell numbers, protein quantiﬁcation: 3
quantitative variables), ‘Soil parameters’ (depth, pH,
temperature, Ntot , Ptot , total carbon, TOC and volumetric water content: 8 quantitative variables) and
‘Time’ (days after contamination, given as three binary
variables). In order to quantify and test eﬀects of various
sets of explanatory variables on the Biolog and Biology
data variation, RDA was applied using the CANOCO
3.12 software [35,36]. RDA is a canonical method that
allows simultaneous analysis of two or more data tables.
Like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), RDA is
used to calculate ordination of samples, with the difference that in RDA the explanatory variables intervene
in the ordination of the response variable matrix. The
ordination vectors are forced to be maximally related to
linear combinations of the explanatory variables [37]
and the canonical model can be tested. Variables of the
data matrix have been centered by CANOCO, those of
the explanatory variables were standardized. A correlation matrix was used to map the various types of
variables in the data matrix. During the analysis the
most discriminating variables were selected by the ‘forward selection’ procedure of the program. Statistical
tests were run using the Monte Carlo permutation
procedure of CANOCO [38]. The same statistical
package was used for preliminary PCA.

3. Results
3.1. Soil characteristics
Results from chemical soil analysis are presented in
Table 2. The total organic carbon (TOC) content declined from 4–9 g kg1 in topsoil to less than 1 g kg1 in
the vadose zone at 80–130 cm depth where the contamination was buried. However, in selected samples
such as D7 at 1.97 m depth, visible organic matter lenses
led to a high TOC content. Total nitrogen and phosphorus were distributed similarly to TOC. Volumetric
soil water content was inﬂuenced by recharge in the ﬁrst
meter, but remained stable at a depth of 2.50 m. The
maximum water content was found around 2.9 m and
3.3 m depth. The soil pH showed a distinct vertical
gradient with values ranging from 5 in the topsoil to
nearly 7 in the sandy unsaturated zone. However, pH
values higher than 8.5 caused by carbonate minerals in
the moraine gravel were found at 3.36 m depth in core A
and at 3.2 m depth in core G.

3.2. Microbial activity
Carbon dioxide (Fig. 2) was chosen as the factor indicating microbial activity in the vadose zone. Background CO2 concentrations in the soil gas were
heterogeneously distributed in the depth proﬁle, but
were lower than 0.9% everywhere (Fig. 2). A maximum
was found in the topsoil at 4 m horizontal distance due
to mineralization of natural soil organic matter. On day
22 after contamination, a maximum of 1.24% was found
below the buried source, at 3.3 m depth just above the
groundwater table, suggesting an increased mineralization activity in the capillary fringe below the source. On
day 71 highest CO2 concentrations were found at 1 m
distance between 0.3 and 0.8 m depth as well as at 3.3 m
depth. The maximum values of 2.12% were found at day

87 at the same location as on day 22. There was a distinct lateral gradient of CO2 more than 10 m radially
away from the source. The measurements of CO2 at
20 m horizontal distance showed that there was a seasonal variation in the CO2 concentrations. The O2
consumption (data not shown) was small and inversely
correlated to CO2 production indicating that mineralization was essentially linked to aerobic respiration. The
measurements ubiquitously showed more than 17% O2
in the soil air.
3.3. Distribution of microbial cells
The total number of cells counted before contamination decreased from 7  108 –3  109 cells g1 in the
topsoil to 107 –4  107 cells g1 in the sandy vadose zone

between 140 and 280 cm depth (Fig. 3). Increased cell
numbers were found in samples taken from the capillary
fringe (samples A11 and G11). In the saturated zone the
numbers decreased again (sample A12, see Fig. 3). Two
samples of the vadose zone of core D contained unexpectedly high numbers of bacteria: At 2 m depth the
corer was drilled across a local organic matter lens easily
visible by eye. Organic matter, N and P analyses conﬁrmed the observation (Table 2). The reason for the
occurrence of high bacterial numbers at the depth of
2.6 m was less evident, since no visible structural change
accompanied the observed higher contents of organic
matter, P and N. Cell numbers were best correlated with
the Ntot (R2 for all cores >0.9, p < 0:001) and organic
matter content. Protein and cell counts were generally
well correlated with the exception of some surface
samples where the protein content was underestimated.
3.4. Community-level physiological proﬁles
Within a core, the AWCDs were very heterogeneous
and sometimes not exceeding a mean absorption of 0.4.
To compare plates at such low AWCDs was not reasonable in this experiment since surface samples had already reached this value after a few hours, although
bacteria had not started to mineralize all of the degradable substrates by that time. Since the cell numbers in the
vadose zone were very low it seemed to be unreasonable
to dilute extracts of other samples to the cell density of
those poor ones, which would have led to losses of bacterial strains. Neither, did we divide absorbance values
by the AWCD since the activity of bacteria in surface soil
and deeper vadose zone is very diﬀerent, and we would
have lost information as described in [29,39]. Hence,
PCA proﬁles of the areas under the curve up to 120 h
were compared with those using data at 72 and 96 h and
no obvious diﬀerences were detected, indicating that an
incubation time of 72 h was long enough to level out
diﬀerences in inoculum densities. The substrate richness
(S) at 72 h is indicated in Table 3. All three cores show a
similar pattern of S and CV. Generally, S and CV tended
to decrease with depth. Unexpectedly high values were,
however, found in samples A11 and G11 from the capillary fringe, indicating high functional diversity. In core
D, high values for both parameters were found in the
organic matter rich sample D7 at 1.97 m depth. The low
cell number in some of the deeper samples led to only
few degraded substrates and to considerable variations
between replicates.
3.5. RDA ordination
The correlation structure between the variables ‘Biology data’, ‘Soil parameters’ and ‘Time’ is summarized
in Fig. 4, whereas Fig. 5 shows the correlation structure

between ‘Biolog area 120h’, ‘Soil parameters’, ‘Time’
and ‘Biology data’. Hydrocarbon concentrations in soil
gas were not used since the variance inﬂation factors in
the canonical regression model were very high and the
13 variables (petroleum hydrocarbons) had to be reduced to two. Instead, the time can be used as an indirect measure of the exposure by hydrocarbon pollution.
The variance in the ‘Biology data’ (Fig. 4(a)), consisting of cell counts, protein quantiﬁcation and CO2
measurements, could be explained to 46% by the ‘Soil
parameters’, and ‘Time’ explained another 39.8% of
variance, 5.7% of those values being shared. This result
is signiﬁcant overall (p < 0:001). Forward selection was
used in order to reduce the number of variables of ‘Soil
parameters’ to approximately the same as in ‘Time’.
Variables explaining the largest statistically signiﬁcant
amount of variation were Ptot (p < 0:001), Ntot (p
< 0:001), temperature (p < 0:005) and pH (p < 0:046).
With these variables, 51.2% of variance was explained,
but we eliminated ‘temperature’ since some missing
values were calculated. The next most signiﬁcant variable, ‘water content’, was instead included in the further
RDA. Depth, TOC and total carbon (TC) were all
highly correlated with the above-mentioned variables. In
the triplots Fig. 4(b) and 5(b), quantitative variables are
represented by arrows, qualitative explanatory variables
(centro€ıds) are indicated by their label. The angle between two arrows and between an arrow and an axis or
between an arrow and inter-connecting line between the
origin and an object-point are proportional to the correlation. Distance between object-points and between
centro€ıd-points, or between each other, are interpreted,
respectively, as a mutual similarity or contribution. The
projection of a centro€id-point onto an arrow is proportional to its contribution. High correlations between
cell number, Ntot , Ptot and protein measurements and
the ﬁrst RDA axis are observed. The pH is negatively
correlated with those variables. CO2 is correlated with
axis 2. It is remarkable that the arrow ‘CO2 content’ is
perpendicular to the arrow ‘cell numbers’, meaning that
they are independent. Cores are clearly separated by
CO2 , and, indeed, the centro€ıd for day 80 is opposed to
day 23 and the one representing the background. The
samples of each core are arranged according to depth,
selected soil parameters and biomass related variables.
In the analysis of ‘Biolog area’ (Fig. 5), the number of
soil variables was reduced by forward selection for the
same reason as described above. Again four variables
were retained for the RDA: Ptot (p < 0:014), depth
(p < 0:036), volumetric water content (p < 0:047) and
Ntot (p < 0:26). The total explained variance in this canonical model is 42.7%, ‘Time’ explains 9.45%, ‘Soil
parameters’ 27.05% and ‘Biology’ 15.6%. Shared variance occurred only between ‘Soil parameters’ and ‘Biology’ and was 9.4% of the previously mentioned values.
This result is overall signiﬁcant (p < 0:007). Descriptors

which are well correlated with the two ﬁrst RDA axes
were either polymers or carboxylic acids, according to
the grouping of [31]. ‘Biolog area’ data did not separate
the cores well but arranged samples in the following
ways: in the bottom right quadrant are samples with
high organic matter, which proved to be positively
correlated with the selected soil variables Ntot and Ptot ,
in the bottom left quadrant are samples, which were
exposed to high petroleum concentrations and which is
in accordance with the CO2 variable (see Table 2), in the
top left quadrant are deep samples with a high water
content, and in the ﬁrst quadrant are less contaminated
samples with small cell numbers. A11 and G11 have
rather high cell numbers, have a high pH and are situated between two soil layers with high volumetric water
contents.

Variance in ‘Biology data’ in samples of all soil cores
(A–I) at the source depth was to 98% explainable by
‘Soil parameters’ when all variables were included. By
reducing the ‘Soil parameters’ by forward selection but
including ‘Time’ for explanation, 96.8% of the variance
was explained with a signiﬁcant overall model and one
signiﬁcant axis (data not shown).

4. Discussion
4.1. Microbial activity and abundance vs. nutrient limitation
Measurable CO2 production started 16 days after
contamination of our experimental ﬁeld site. This was
later than expected since the lag phase in the lysimeter
experiment described in [28] lasted only one day. The
production of CO2 was spatially closely related to the
extension of the hydrocarbon vapor plume. However,
although CO2 concentration clearly increased at 0.7 m
from the source (Fig. 2), the bacterial cell numbers increased only insigniﬁcantly (Fig. 3). This ﬁnding was
unexpected since Ainsworth et al. [23] reported on 104 –
107 cells per gram of uncontaminated, dry soil and
orders of magnitude higher cell numbers when contaminants were present at relatively high but not toxic
concentrations. Zarda and co-workers [14] drilled cores
through the unsaturated zone above a xylene plume.
They found elevated numbers of bacteria and protists,
especially in the xylene-aﬀected zone just above the
groundwater table and in the saturated zone. Pasteris
et al. [28] observed increasing cell numbers in a lysimeter
study after contamination by a similar petroleum mixture as the one used here, using the same counting
method. Since in our study neither a signiﬁcant increase
in cell numbers nor a correlation between CO2 production and cell numbers could be detected, it is likely
that growth was limited by soil parameters such as nutrient concentrations and that degradation was essentially due to the metabolism of non-growing cells. Zhou
and Crawford [40] showed that biodegradation of gasoline vapors in soil depended on the C:N ratio. The
authors suggested that lower C:N ratios favored microbial growth. A good C:N ratio for their soils was 50:1
or lower. The natural ratio of TOC:N in the unsaturated
zone of the Vrløse soils is between 20:1 and 50:1.
Taking into account the hydrocarbon contamination,
which exceeds 1780 ppm described in [40], the ratio
becomes higher than 50:1 and is thus outside the reported optimal range. Batch experiments carried out
with Vrløse soil showed increasing degradation when
ammonium vapor was added (N. Dakhel and P.
H€
ohener, personal communication), which conﬁrms the
assumption of N-limitation. This ﬁnding is in agreement
with the better correlation of cell numbers with Ntot

than with any other soil parameter (R2 > 0:9) and is
concordant with results of [41], who found N limitation
for toluene degradation in subsurface soils.
4.2. Parameters inﬂuencing community size, activity and
structure
The forward selection for the RDA model assessed
the following order from the most to the least explicative
variable of the ‘Biology data’: Ptot > Ntot > temperature > pH > water content > TOC > Ctot > depth. PLFA
data ordination in a study from [42] about sheep grazing

on grassland shows that the microbial biomass variation
among soils as determined by PLFA quantiﬁcation is
mostly correlated to diﬀerences in organic matter content and soil pH. Cell numbers in our study correlated
negatively with pH. Ntot and TOC were highly correlated so that only the former was used for RDA. Neither
CO2 nor hydrocarbons were detected in topsoil since the
gases diﬀused out to the atmosphere. Hence, topsoil
samples in Fig. 4(b) are apart from the CO2 axis. The
uncontaminated core A is more dispersed along the cell
number–pH axis than contaminated samples. Samples

k: 0.103, p > 0:1) are represented. Samples are labeled according to the time of contamination (A: before, D: 23 days after and G: 80 days after) and

and have a lower water content than their neighboring
samples, are not clearly grouped apart of the other data
points in Fig. 4(b). This is diﬀerent from what is inferred
from the ‘Biolog area’ graph (Fig. 5(b)). Bacteria in
these samples were able to degrade more substrates than
in surface samples. The CV shows that this ﬁnding was
reproducible. The reciprocal Simpson index [43] was
25.6 for A11 and 20.7 for G11 and, hence, signiﬁcantly
higher than the average of the subsurface samples
(samples 5–10, A ¼ 13:6, D ¼ 11:4 and G ¼ 9:07) and
the surface samples (samples 1–3, A ¼ 15:34, D ¼ 14:53
and G ¼ 16:4). It is remarkable that samples exposed to
highest hydrocarbon doses are clustering together in the
RDA plot since distinctive grouping of these exposed
samples with PCA did not occur. The kerosene vapor
concentration of these samples in the third quadrant was

higher than 10 g m3 at the sample day. The distance
from the origin to the data point for day 23 is longer
than to the point of day 80. This may be indicative of a
higher inﬂuence of the contamination on functional diversity after 3 weeks. Other authors reported on distinction due to hydrocarbon contamination but in most
cases they applied higher oil concentrations [4]. Bundy
and coworkers [10] incubated three diﬀerent soils with
diesel oil for 103 days in jar microcosm experiments. By
performing PCA on Biolog GN data, they found that
contaminated samples were clearly separated from uncontaminated samples, but that controls were also
altered.
Biolog plates have in the last few years become a
widely used tool in soil microbiology and they are generally considered as a sensitive tool to ﬁngerprint

398

K. Kaufmann et al. / FEMS Microbiology Ecology 48 (2004) 387–399

communities [4,44,45], however, the method for analyzing the data is still open to debate. In most studies the
classical GN2 plates with their 95 substrates plates are
used [29]. The reduction of substrates to 31 by using
BiologTM EcoPlates proved to be useful in our study
because more repetitions could be made on one plate
and the weak pattern reproducibility in the samples at
depths around )1.75 and )2.90 m became apparent.
This weak reproducibility as reported in the CV in Table
3 occurred at all sampling times and was probably not a
methodic artifact but was due to the low microbial activity. A more sensitive tetrazolium dye in BiologTM
EcoPlates would probably increase the reproducibility.
However, RDA based on BiologTM EcoPlates data allowed the distinction between major inﬂuences on the
community structure. But we should not forget that
57.3%, of the variance in the ‘Biolog area’ data remained
unexplained with our measured variables and the
grouping was hence inﬂuenced by unknown factors.
These factors might be related to either the whole extraction method or the data analysis. For further studies, a CLPP method that does not require extraction of
microorganisms from soil would be welcome.
