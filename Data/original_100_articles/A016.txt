Bacterial community dynamics and biodegradation processes were examined in a highly creosote-contaminated soil undergoing a range of laboratory-based bioremediation treatments. The dynamics of the eubacterial
community, the number of heterotrophs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degraders, and the total
petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) and PAH concentrations were monitored during the bioremediation process.
TPH and PAHs were significantly degraded in all treatments (72 to 79% and 83 to 87%, respectively), and the
biodegradation values were higher when nutrients were not added, especially for benzo(a)anthracene and
chrysene. The moisture content and aeration were determined to be the key factors associated with PAH
bioremediation. Neither biosurfactant addition, bioaugmentation, nor ferric octate addition led to differences
in PAH or TPH biodegradation compared to biodegradation with nutrient treatment. All treatments resulted
in a high first-order degradation rate during the first 45 days, which was markedly reduced after 90 days. A
sharp increase in the size of the heterotrophic and PAH-degrading microbial populations was observed, which
coincided with the highest rates of TPH and PAH biodegradation. At the end of the incubation period, PAH
degraders were more prevalent in samples to which nutrients had not been added. Denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis analysis and principal-component analysis confirmed that there was a remarkable shift in the
composition of the bacterial community due to both the biodegradation process and the addition of nutrients.
At early stages of biodegradation, the ␣-Proteobacteria group (genera Sphingomonas and Azospirillum) was the
dominant group in all treatments. At later stages, the ␥-Proteobacteria group (genus Xanthomonas), the
␣-Proteobacteria group (genus Sphingomonas), and the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides group (Bacteroidetes)
were the dominant groups in the nonnutrient treatment, while the ␥-Proteobacteria group (genus Xathomonas),
the ␤-Proteobacteria group (genera Alcaligenes and Achromobacter), and the ␣-Proteobacteria group (genus
Sphingomonas) were the dominant groups in the nutrient treatment. This study shows that specific bacterial
phylotypes are associated both with different phases of PAH degradation and with nutrient addition in a
preadapted PAH-contaminated soil. Our findings also suggest that there are complex interactions between
bacterial species and medium conditions that influence the biodegradation capacity of the microbial communities involved in bioremediation processes.
phosphorus, which allows the necessary increase in the size of
the hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations.
Taking into account the fact that each contaminated site can
respond in a different way to distinct parameters that affect
microbial biodegradation, laboratory-scale bioremediation
protocols have been developed in order to determine the effects of different conditions (30). In such feasibility studies,
addition of nutrients, biosurfactants, exogenous inocula, or
other additives can be assayed. Nevertheless, in almost all of
these studies monitoring of the process is based on chemical
analysis of contaminants. A better understanding of the diversity of the microbial communities inhabiting PAH-contaminated soils and their response to different biostimulation or
bioaugmentation strategies could provide clues about the type
of bacteria that are able to adapt to and exploit such habitats.
It is well known that the majority of microbes in environmental samples cannot be cultured at present in laboratory
media, which are biased for the growth of specific microorganisms (5, 34). In light of this, molecular biological techniques
offer new opportunities. For example, denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis (DGGE) allows us to directly determine the
presence and relative levels of different 16S rRNA gene am-

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of
fused-ring aromatic compounds that are ubiquitous environmental pollutants (13). Microorganisms play an important role
in the degradation of PAHs in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and microbial degradation is the main process in natural
decontamination. Enhancement of this phenomenon is the
basis of bioremediation technologies (2).
Microbial degradation of PAHs in soil is restricted by various factors that often result in a lower-than-expected bioremediation efficiency. One of these factors is the low bioavailability
of the compounds. In a recent study (1) we described significant enhancement of the biodegradation of high-molecularweight PAHs and alkylated derivatives of these compounds
from Casablanca crude oil caused by a microbial consortium in
the presence of a biosurfactant produced by Pseudomonas
aeruginosa strain AT10. Another important factor in bioremediation of contaminated soils is the availability of nitrogen and

plicons both qualitatively and semiquantitatively in order to
perform a community analysis (15).
Although there has been much research on the bacterial
community structure associated with bioremediation of different kinds of environmental pollutants (18, 23, 26), little is
known about bioremediation of PAH-contaminated soils. The
few studies that have been described to date have been performed either with soils with low levels of PAH contamination
(6, 41, 28) or with spiked soils (32), and there has not been
accurate monitoring of the microbial population dynamics
throughout the biodegradation process.
To assess both the potential of bioremediation in a heavily
PAH-contaminated soil and the effects of different treatments
on the bacterial community structure, we used a series of
bioremediation treatments in microcosm experiments. An old,
loamy clay soil that was heavily contaminated with PAH-creosote (⬃8,000 mg total petroleum hydrocarbon [TPH] kg of
soil⫺1, including 2,700 mg resolved PAH kg of soil⫺1) was
subjected to different treatments. Degradation of the PAHs
and TPH of creosote was monitored. The bacterial community
was studied by culture-independent analysis of 16S rRNA
genes by means of DGGE (25) and determination of the most
probable number (MPN) of heterotrophs and PAH degraders
in the microbial population (39).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Soil analysis. A composite sample of creosote-contaminated soil (50 kg) from
a wood treatment plant near Barcelona, Spain, was obtained from the top 20 cm
and sieved (⬍6 mm). The soil texture was determined by sedimentation analysis
(16). The primary dissolved inorganic constituents of a saturated paste extract
(nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, phosphorus) were determined using ion chromatography (30). The soil moisture content, water-holding capacity (WHC), electrical
conductivity, total organic carbon content, total nitrogen content, and pH were
determined as described previously (30).
Seven different treatments in microcosms experiments designated 1M to 7M
were used in the study, as shown in Table 1. To determine the best soil water
content for use in the microcosm experiments, five different water contents (5%,
20%, 40%, 60%, and 75% WHC) and autoclaved soil as an abiotic control were
assayed for 15 days in triplicate in miniaturized microcosms with the nutrient

additions described in Table 1. The best results (P ⬍ 0.05) were observed with
40% and 60% WHC (22 to 27% biodegradation of TPH), while with 20% and
75% WHC only slight biodegradation was observed (14%). Untreated soil (5%
WHC) did not show significant biodegradation (P ⬎ 0.05). Thus, water content
was established as a key factor for biodegradation activity, and 40% WHC was
defined as the optimal water content for soil microcosm experiments.
Chemical, microbial, and molecular analyses were carried out on sampling
days 0, 21, 45, 90, 135, and 200. At each sampling time, 30 g of soil was extracted
as a composite sample from five points in each microcosm and stored at ⫺20°C
prior to most analyses; the only exception was microbial counting, which was
performed immediately after sampling.
Monitoring the concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbon and polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons. Samples were dried for 16 h at room temperature and
sieved (⬍2 mm). Before extraction, an orthoterphenyl acetone solution was
added to 2 g of sieved, dried soil as a surrogate internal standard. The spiked
sample was extracted five times in an ultrasonic bath (15 min for each extraction)
with 10 ml of dichloromethane-acetone (1:1, vol/vol), and the extracts were
combined to obtain the total organic extract. The extracts were dried over
Na2SO4 and concentrated in a rotary evaporator to dryness. The TPH fraction
was obtained with an alumina chromatographic column using the EPA3611
method (U.S. Environmental Agency). The TPH fraction and the PAHs were
analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection using a Trace
2000 gas chromatograph (Thermo Quest, Milan, Italy) as described previously
(1). Before this, a set of samples was analyzed by gas chromatography with a mass
detector to verify the purity of the peaks analyzed by gas chromatography with
flame ionization detection (data not shown). Final TPH and PAH concentrations
were calculated using standard calibration curves for TPH and each PAH.
Monitoring of heterotrophic and hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations. Total heterotrophic and PAH-degrading microbial population counts were
determined on days 0, 21, 45, 90, 135, and 200 using a miniaturized mostprobable-number (MPN) technique as described previously (39).
DNA extraction. Soil samples for DNA extraction were collected from each
microcosm on days 0, 21, 45, 90, 135, and 200 in sterile Eppendorf tubes and
stored at ⫺20°C prior to analysis.
Total community DNA was extracted from all soil microcosms following a
bead beating protocol using an Ultraclean DNA soil extraction kit (MoBio
Laboratories, Inc., Solano Beach, CA). Suitable yields of high-molecular-weight
DNA (5 to 20 ␮g g of soil⫺1) were obtained. An additional purification step with
a Clean DNA Wizard kit (Promega, Madison, WI) was employed to avoid PCR
inhibition.
Preliminary data for independent triplicate microcosms showed that the Pearson correlation moment vector (r) calculated from the relative band intensities of
DGGE profiles for treatments 1M, 2M, and 4M (after 0 and 200 days of incubation) was more than 0.85. These data indicated that there was homogeneity in

each treatment. Hence, DNA was extracted from a composite 0.75-g sample
containing 0.25 g of each microcosm replicate.
PCR. The V3 to V5 variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified
using primers 16F341-GC and 16R907 (40). Primer F341-GC included a GC
clamp at the 5⬘ end (5⬘-CGCCCGCCGCGCCCCGCGCCCGTCCCG CCGCCC
CCGCCCG-3⬘). All PCRs were performed with a personal Mastercycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Fifty microliters of the PCR mixture contained
2.5 U of TaqGold (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 9.0), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, each deoxynucleoside triphosphate at a
concentration of 200 ␮M, each primer at a concentration of 0.5 ␮M, and 100 ng
of template DNA quantified by means of the Low DNA Mass Ladder (Gibco
BRL, Rockville, MD). After 9 min of initial denaturation at 95°C, a touchdown
thermal profile protocol was used, and the annealing temperature was decreased
by 1°C per cycle from 65°C to 55°C; then 20 additional cycles at 55°C were
performed. Amplification was carried out with 1 min of denaturation at 94°C, 1
min of primer annealing, and 1.5 min of primer extension at 72°C, followed by 10
min of final primer extension. PCRs were done in duplicate using template DNA
from soil microcosm composite samples, and then the mixtures were combined
prior to DGGE analysis.
DGGE. Approximately 800 ng of purified PCR product quantified by using the
Low DNA Mass Ladder (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD) was loaded onto a 6%
(wt/vol) polyacrylamide gel that was 0.75 mm thick (to obtain better resolution),
and the denaturing gradients used ranged from 35 to 70% denaturant (100%
denaturant contained 7 M urea and 40% formamide). DGGE was performed in
1⫻ TAE buffer (40 mM Tris, 20 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA; pH 7.4) using
a DGGE-2001 system (CBS Scientific Company, Del Mar, CA) at 100 V and
60°C for 16 h.
The gels were stained for 45 min in 1⫻ TAE buffer containing SybrGold
(Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), viewed under UV light, and analyzed
using Image Master (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany).
Analysis of DGGE images. Images of DGGE gels were digitized, and DGGE
bands were processed using the Quantity-one image analysis software (version
4.1; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and manually corrected. After normalization of the gels, bands with relative peak area intensities greater than 2%
were included in further analyses. Bacterial diversity was assessed using the
Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H⬘), calculated as follows (15): H⬘ ⫽ ⫺⌺ Pi log
Pi, where Pi is the relative peak area intensity of a DGGE band, calculated from
ni/N, where ni is the peak area of the band and N is the sum of all peak areas in
the densitometry curve. Furthermore, a covariance principal-component analysis
(PCA) of band types and peak heights was carried out for treatments 1M, 2M,
and 4M to consider possible shifts in the composition of the microbial populations. The effect of bioaugmentation (treatment 6M) on the microbial diversity of
the soil was assessed by comparing the DGGE profiles for treatments 1M (un-

treated), 4M (nutrients added), and 6M (nutrients and inoculum added) by a
similarity cluster analysis. A dendrogram was constructed using the unweighted
pair group method with the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient
calculated from the complete densitometric curves for fingerprints of soil bacterial community microcosms. The PCA and similarity cluster analysis were
performed using the Excel application StatistiXL, version 1.4.
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis bands. Predominant DGGE bands were excised with a sterile razor
blade, resuspended in 50 ␮l sterilized MilliQ water, stored at 4°C overnight,
reamplified, cloned in the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and
sequenced by using an ABI Prism Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing reaction
kit, version 3.1 (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and an ABI
3700 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and
following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sequences were edited and assembled using version 4.8.7 of the BioEdit
software (17), inspected for the presence of ambiguous base assignments, and
subjected to the Check Chimera program of the Ribosomal Database Project
(24) before the sequences were examined with the BLAST and RDP search
alignment tool comparison software (4, 24).
Statistical analysis. Data were subjected to analysis of variance using the
Statgraphics Plus package (version 5.1; Statistical Graphics Corp., Manguistics
Inc., United States). Duncan’s multiple-range test of means, with a significance
level of 0.05, was applied to the results to determine their statistical significance.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The 38 nucleotide sequences identified in this study have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession
numbers AY58562 to AY758599.

RESULTS
Soil properties. The soil was a loamy clay soil containing
40% clay, 28% silt, and 32% sand. The total organic carbon
and total nitrogen contents were 4.2% and 0.15%, respectively;
the inorganic nitrogen content was 20 mg kg⫺1 nitrate and
2.8 mg kg⫺1 ammonium, and the phosphate content was low
(less than 1 mg kg⫺1). The soil had low conductivity (228 ␮S
cm⫺2), the pH was 7,5, and the water content was extremely
low (1.6%). Conversely, the soil had a high WHC (27.7%),
possibly due to the high clay content. The PAH degraders
accounted for up to 12% of the total heterotrophic microbial
population, with 1.8 ⫻ 105 cells g (dry weight) of soil⫺1.

Total petroleum hydrocarbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation. The contaminated soil had a high
initial TPH concentration (around 8,000 mg kg [dry weight] of
soil⫺1) (Table 2). When aromatic compounds were examined,
no phenol derivatives, naphthalene, or alkyl derivatives of
naphthalene were detected (the detection limit was more than
0.5 ␮g g [dry weight] of soil⫺1). Consequently, we presumed
that a limited amount of PAHs and TPH was lost by evaporation and/or biodegradation prior to soil sampling. PAHs
with three and four rings were the most abundant components, and their concentrations were between 100 and 700 mg
kg⫺1. The polyaromatic fraction accounted for 90% of the
TPH fraction (as determined by gravimetric measurement),
while the TPH accounted for 85% of the total organic extract.
The TPH concentration did not decrease significantly (P ⬎

the 200-day experiment, whereas there was a slight decrease in
autoclaved soil (treatment 3M). The same behavior was observed for the target PAHs. Hence, untreated dry soil (treatment 1M) was used as a control with which to calculate hydrocarbon biodegradation for the different treatments and to
compare changes in microbial diversity.
By the end of the experiment (200 days), significant TPH
biodegradation was observed for all treatments (treatments
2M and 4M to 7M) (Table 2). Biostimulation without nutrient
addition (treatment 2M) resulted in slightly greater TPH depletion (P ⬍ 0.05) than the treatments in which nutrients were
added (treatments 4M to 7M).
To study the rates of biodegradation of TPH and target
PAHs, biphasic TPH degradation kinetics were assessed because a single first-order decay curve fitted to the entire data
set did not adequately explain (r 2 ⬍ 0.8) the changes in TPH
concentration observed during the course of the experiment.
Thus, two degradation rates (k1 and k2) were defined according
to the breakpoints that best fit the data for all treatments; k1
was used for the early-stage group (from 0 to 45 days of
incubation), and k2 was used for the late-stage group (from 90
to 200 days of incubation) (Table 3). It is important to note
that k2 was 1 order of magnitude lower than k1 for all treatments, with values near zero for treatments with nutrients.
During the first 45 days, the first-order TPH degradation rate
constant (k1) was slightly lower for the treatment without nutrients (treatment 2M) than for the other treatments. In contrast, the rate constant (k2) for the late stage (90 to 200 days)
was higher (P ⬍ 0.05). These rate constants are similar to those
reported in other studies of bioremediation in hydrocarboncontaminated soils (18, 35).
Two- and three-ring PAHs were highly degraded (80 to
100%) during the first 45 days, and the biodegradation rate (k)
was the same for all treatments (P ⬎ 0.05) (Tables 2 and 3). An
exception was 1-methyl-anthracene, for which the biodegradation rate was higher (P ⬍ 0.05) in treatments without nutrient
amendment. Interestingly, phenanthrene and anthracene were
not completely degraded (Table 2). One possible explanation
for this could be the low bioavailability of the residual quantities of these compounds present after day 45 (31). The biodegradation kinetics of fluoranthene were not affected by nutrient addition (Table 3), whereas the early-stage
biodegradation kinetics (k1) of pyrene were slower in the absence of nutrient addition (P ⬍ 0.05).

The degree of benzo(a)anthracene and chrysene degradation
was significantly different when biostimulation without addition of
nutrients (treatment 2M) was compared with treatments in which
nutrients were added (treatments 4M to 7M). Both compounds
were degraded more (P ⬍ 0.05) under biostimulation conditions
without nutrient addition than in treatments with nutrient addition (Table 2). Furthermore, the late-stage biodegradation rates
were significantly higher (P ⬍ 0.05) without nutrient addition
[10-fold higher for benzo(a)anthracene biodegradation and
threefold higher for chrysene biodegradation] (Table 3). Benzo(a)pyrene and benzo(b⫹k)fluoranthene were not significantly degraded (P ⬎ 0.05). The percentages of PAH biodegradation and
the kinetics are similar to those reported in other studies (7, 12).
Monitoring of the heterotrophic and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon-degrading microbial populations. As shown in
Fig. 1, the sizes of both the heterotrophic and PAH-degrading
microbial populations increased 2 to 3 orders of magnitude
between day 0 and day 21 for treatments in which there was
nutrient addition (treatments 4M to 7M), whereas the population subjected to the biostimulation treatment without nutrient addition (treatment 2M) increased more slowly (1 to 2
orders of magnitude at 21 to 45 days). After 90 days of incubation, the sizes of both populations returned to the initial
values for treatments in which there was nutrient addition

(treatments 4M to 7M), whereas for treatment 2M the PAHdegrading population remained 1 order of magnitude larger
than the population at the initial stage. In untreated dry soil
(treatment 1M), the size of the heterotrophic population remained constant until day 135 and the size of the PAH-degrading population remained constant until day 90. Between
days 135 and 200 the sizes of the two populations decreased by
approximately 1 order of magnitude.
Aeration and the optimal humidity (treatment 2M) resulted
in a remarkable shift in the proportion of the PAH-degrading
population (Fig. 1).
No differences in microbial population counts were observed
when the results for addition of biosurfactant (treatment 5M),
addition of ferric octoate (treatment 7M), or bioaugmentation
(treatment 6M) were compared with the results for treatment 4M.
Analysis of treatments by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The biodegradation results and microbial counts revealed three different treatment groups: (i) untreated soil, (ii)
treated soil without nutrient addition, and (iii) treated soil with
nutrient addition. Thus, the effects of different biostimulation
conditions on the structure and dynamics of the bacterial community were analyzed by DGGE by using samples from treatments 1M (untreated soil), 2M (aerated soil at 40% waterholding capacity without nutrient addition), and 4M (like
treatment 2M but with nutrient addition) taken during the
200-day experiment. In addition, the effect of bioaugmentation
(treatment 6M) was monitored by DGGE, and this treatment
was compared with treatments 4M and 1M.
The bacterial community in untreated soil (treatment 1M)
was complex (27 or 28 DGGE bands) and did not change over
the course of the 200-day experiment (Fig. 2). However, biostimulation treatments with (treatment 4M) and without
(treatment 2M) nutrient addition resulted in shifts in the composition of the microbial community. In particular, the initial
profiles (21 and 45 days) were clearly different; the 2M and 4M
treatments produced 22 to 24 and 19 to 22 DGGE bands,
respectively (Fig. 2).
The microbial diversity decreased during the maximum biodegradation period for all treatments, from 1.28 on day 0 to
1.18 after 90 days, and remained low until the end of the
incubation. Other authors have described both increases and
reductions in diversity during biodegradation. Our results are
similar to those reported by Andreoni et al. (6) obtained with
a PAH-contaminated soil, whereas Kaplan and Kitts (18) and
Zucchi et al. (41) reported increases in diversity during bioremediation of crude oil-contaminated soil.
Principal-component analysis of the bacterial community.
Temporal changes in the bacterial community were monitored
using principal-component analysis (Fig. 3). Based on visual
inspection of the raw data, there was a clear difference in the
DGGE profiles between microcosms that depended on the
time and type of biostimulation treatment. PCA revealed three
different groups; the first group consisted of untreated soil (at
0 and 200 days), and the second and third groups consisted of
biostimulated soil with and without nutrient addition, respectively. Both biostimulation treatments (treatments 2M and
4M) exhibited a noticeable and regular separation from untreated soil (treatment 1M) in the first principal component
(PC1), which explained 35.9% of the variation in the data

during the 200 days of incubation (Fig. 3). Furthermore, for
each treatment the PC1 value was increasingly far from the
initial point as incubation time increased. The highest second
principal component (PC2) for the 2M treatment corresponded to positive values, while for the 4M treatment the
values were negative (Table 4). This could explain the distance
in PC2 observed between the biostimulation treatments. Analysis of variance of the PC2 scores, which represented 24.0% of
the variation in the data, showed that there was a significant
difference between biostimulation groups (P ⬍ 0.05) over the
course of the experiment. Coincidentally, the greatest change
in PC2 occurred during the first 45 days of incubation, during
which the TPH biodegradation rates were more significant
(Table 2).
It is interesting that only two bands were shared by different
treatments. Bands B2-11 and B2-20 were identical to bands
B4-12 and B4-24, respectively. Furthermore, these DGGE
bands displayed similar dynamics for the two treatments and
exhibited the most negative PC1 loading values (0.909 and
0.961, respectively). Their dynamics could explain the migration along PC1 observed for both treatments. The treatment
2M bands with the highest PC2 loading values were B2-3 and
B2-16, while for the 4M treatment B4-17 had the most negative

PC2 loading value. Band B4-3, which was the most abundant
band in the early biodegradation stage at 0 to 45 days for the
4M treatment, disappeared after 90 days and did not have a
high PCA loading value (Table 4). Nevertheless, this band
could be important in the biodegradation of three-ring PAHs
because at this time these compounds exhibited maximum
depletion.
Phylogenetic and dynamic analysis of excised bands. Taxonomic assignments of the prominent DGGE bands were determined for biostimulation treatments 2M and 4M. Bands
from untreated soil (treatment 1M) were not excised because

they were weak, but they were assigned to comigrating bands
of treatments 2M and 4M which exhibited higher intensity
(Fig. 2 and Table 4). Table 4 shows the closest relatives of
DGGE bands excised for biostimulation treatments 2M and
4M. Most of the sequences derived from DGGE bands exhibited levels of similarity greater than 95%.
Taking into account the assignment to comigrating bands,
the original soil contained five ␣-Proteobacteria (Sphingomonas, Rhizobium-Agrobacterium, and Azospirillum groups) and
eight ␥-Proteobacteria (Xanthomonas group), according to
RDP classification (24). Biostimulated soil from treatment 2M

contained 53% ␣-Proteobacteria (9/17 DGGE bands), 6%
␤-Proteobacteria (1/17 DGGE bands), and 23% ␥-Proteobacteria (4/17 DGGE bands) (Table 4). No rhodococci were found,
but the closest relatives to the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) group, which accounted for 12% of the sample
(2/17 DGGE bands), were found after 45 days. Soil subjected
to the 4M treatment contained 55% ␣-Proteobacteria (11/20
DGGE bands), 15% ␤-Proteobacteria (3/20 DGGE bands),
25% ␥-Proteobacteria (5/20 DGGE bands), and 5% high-G⫹Ccontent gram-positive bacteria (1/20 DGGE bands). No close
relatives belonging to the CFB group were found in the 4M
treatment soil.
At early stages (0 to 90 days), for treatment 2M soil five dominant bands (relative intensity greater than 5%) were observed
(B2-11, B2-12, B2-20, B2-8, and B2-9) (Table 4). Three of these
bands (B2-11, B2-12, and B2-20) belonged to ␣-Proteobacteria
(Sphingomonadaceae and Rhodospirillaceae), whereas B2-8 belonged to ␤-Proteobacteria (Comamonadaceae) and B2-9 belonged to ␥-Proteobacteria (Xanthomonadaceae). Neither CFB
bacteria nor high-G⫹C-content gram-positive bacteria were
found at early stages of biodegradation.
At late stages (90 to 200 days), for treatment 2M soil five
dominant bands (relative intensity greater than 5%) were observed (B2-1, B2-3, B2-15, B2-16, and B2-19) (Table 4). Three
of these bands (B2-15, B2-16, and B2-19) belonged to the
␥-Proteobacteria (Comamonadaceae and Xanthomonadaceae).
B2-1 belonged to the ␣-Proteobacteria (Sphingomonadaceae),
and B2-3 belonged to the CFB group (Crenotrichaceae). Neither ␤-Proteobacteria nor high-G⫹C-content gram-positive
bacteria were found.
At early stages (0 to 90 days), for treatment 4M soil nine
dominant bands (relative intensity greater than 5%) were observed (B4-3, B4-6, B4-8, B4-10, B4-11, B4-12, B4-13, B4-20,
and B4-24) (Table 4). Six of these bands (B4-3, B4-6, B4-11,
B4-12, B4-13, and B4-24) belonged to ␣-Proteobacteria (Sphingomonadaceae, Rhizobiaceae, and Rhodospirillaceae), one band
(B4-20) belonged to ␤-Proteobacteria (Alcaligenaceae), and two
bands (B4-8 and B4-10) belonged to ␥-Proteobacteria (Xanthomonadaceae). Neither CFB bacteria nor high-G⫹C-content
gram-positive bacteria were found.

At late stages (90 to 200 days), for treatment 4M soil nine
dominant bands (relative intensity greater than 5%) were observed (B4-7, B4-10, B4-14, B4-17, B4-20, B4-21, B4-23, and
B4-28). Four of these bands (B4-10, B4-14, B4-17, and B4-21)
belonged to ␥-Proteobacteria (Xanthomonadaceae and unclassified group), two bands (B4-20 and B4-7) belonged to ␤-Proteobacteria (Alcaligenaceae), and one band (B4-23) belonged to
␣-Proteobacteria (Rhizobiaceae), whereas band B4-28 belonged
to the high-G⫹C-content gram-positive bacteria (Nocardiaceae). No CFB bacteria were found.
Phylogenetic groups during bioremediation. At the beginning of the experiment, ␣-Proteobacteria (78%), dominated by
Sphingomonadaceae, were predominant in contaminated soil, followed by ␥-Proteobacteria (16%), dominated by Xanthomonadaceae, whereas the other groups were scarce. During biodegradation, the microbial population shifted dramatically, and after
200 days of incubation of the 2M treatment, ␥-Proteobacteria were
dominant (50%), followed by ␣-Proteobacteria (25%) and the
CFB group (22%), while for the 4M treatment, ␣-Proteobacteria
and ␥-Proteobacteria were the dominant groups (36% each), followed by ␤-Proteobacteria and high-G⫹C-content gram-positive
bacteria (19% and 8%, respectively) (Fig. 4).
A correlation analysis of the phylogenetic groups and evolution of the TPH concentration showed that the ␣- and ␥-Proteobacteria exhibited the highest positive and inverse correlations with the TPH concentration, respectively (r 2 ⫽ 0.92 to
0.93) for the 2M treatment; for the 4M treatment the ␣-Proteobacteria exhibited the highest positive correlation (r 2 ⫽
0.78), whereas the ␤-Proteobacteria exhibited the highest inverse correlation (r 2 ⫽ 0.85), followed by the ␥-Proteobacteria
(r 2 ⫽ 0.78). For target PAH concentrations in the 2M treatment, the CFB group exhibited the highest inverse correlation
(r 2 ⫽ 0.81 to 0.85) with the pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene, and
chrysene concentrations, whereas ␣-Proteobacteria and ␥-Proteobacteria exhibited the highest positive and inverse correlations with fluoranthene (r 2 ⫽ 0.92 to 0.94), phenanthrene (r 2 ⫽
0.76), and anthracene (r 2 ⫽ 0.84). ␤-Proteobacteria did not
exhibit good correlations with target PAHs (r 2 ⫽ 0 to 0.4). In
contrast, for nutrient treatment 4M, ␣-Proteobacteria and

relations, respectively, with fluoranthene and pyrene (r 2 ⫽ 0.83
to 0.89). Also, ␤-Proteobacteria exhibited a good inverse correlation with phenanthrene, anthracene, benzo(a)anthracene,
and chrysene (r 2 ⫽ 0.84 to 0.92). ␥-Proteobacteria exhibited
lower correlations with PAH concentrations (r 2 ⫽ 0.5 to 0.7)
for the 4M treatment.
Monitoring bioaugmentation by denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis. At the beginning of the experiment, the profiles for biostimulation and bioaugmentation were very similar,
forming two clusters (21 and 45 days) in each of the two
treatments (Fig. 5). Only one of the DGGE bands from the
inoculum was shared in inoculated soil during the 200 days of
the experiment. Taking into account the fact that inoculation
was performed five times (days 14, 26, 57, 120, and 165) in
order to have 108 microorganisms g (dry weight) of soil⫺1 at
each time of addition, this result implies that the inoculum did
not compete favorably with the indigenous bacterial community during the first stages of PAH biodegradation. However,
at 200 days the DGGE profiles for biostimulation and bioaugmentation were quite different. Hence, it seems that at early
stages, when the biodegradation process was dominant, an
exogenous inoculum did not affect the distribution of the indigenous microbial population, while at late stages, when the
biodegradation of PAHs and TPH was very slow, it could have
an effect (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
A creosote-contaminated soil from a wood treatment facility
that had been operating for at least 30 years was the subject of
the present study. A high proportion of PAH-degrading bacteria at the beginning of the experiment (Fig. 1) and the absence of a lag phase at the beginning of TPH degradation (data

not shown) revealed the presence of a preadapted PAH-degrading microbial population in the original soil.
Effects of different treatments on the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The kinetics of TPH degradation
displayed a biphasic pattern for all bioremediation treatments.
This behavior may have been due to a number of factors, such
as a decrease in PAH bioavailability (3), accumulation of toxic
PAH metabolites (11), or enrichment of more recalcitrant
compounds (30). In a parallel study, a decrease in bioavailability was demonstrated (31). The accumulation of metabolites
resulting from oxidation of PAHs can reduce the viability of
several PAH degraders in addition to inhibiting the degradation of PAH (11, 20, 21). Nevertheless, this probably was not
the case in this study, because polar metabolites determined by
gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the derivatized polar fraction did not accumulate in the soil (31). In addition,
leachates from the soil after the different treatments showed
that there was a reduction in soil toxicity, as determined by
Microtox (31).
Taking into account the finding that in the original dry soil
(water content, 1.6%) the TPH concentration was not reduced
during the experiment, water content and aeration became the
key factors for soil bioremediation. The quantities of nutrients
added in our treatments, taking into account only the inorganic
nitrogen forms, were established in order to obtain a molar
C/N/P ratio of 300:10:1. The required quantities were added at
three times during the experiment in order to avoid inhibition
caused by a drastic osmotic change, as has been described
elsewhere (38). Recently, Atagana (7) described the ratio used
in this study as optimal for a creosote-contaminated soil.
As shown in Table 3, our results suggest that nutrient addition had a negative effect on late-stage biodegradation of fourring PAHs and TPHs. The presence of an excess of nutrients

hodka and in oil-spiked intertidal sediments after 6 days,
respectively.
During data analysis, a high abundance of gram-negative
bacteria was observed that could have been due to the extraction bias. However, the extraction method used in this study
was able to extract DNA from gram-positive bacteria, such as
Rhodococcus (this study), Mycobacterium, and Bacillus laboratory strains, suggesting that gram-negative bacteria dominated
the creosote-contaminated soil during the bioremediation
process.
Bioaugmentation assay. For the bioaugmentation treatment
(treatment 6M), no differences in the rates of biodegradation
of TPH and PAHs or in community structure determined by
PCR-DGGE and MPN analysis were detected. In a previous
study (36) we observed that the PAH-degrading capability of
consortium AM (used as the inoculum in the present study)
was not affected after growth in rich media. Also, this consortium contained 19 microbial components identified as Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Ochrobactrum, Alcaligenes, Pandorea, Labrys, and Fusarium (37). As shown in
Fig. 5, none of the visible bands from consortium AM comigrated with bands from inoculated soil (treatment 6M), indicating that the inoculated microorganisms did not compete
favorably with the indigenous bacterial community, even
though they were originally from a PAH-contaminated soil
(36) and the inoculum size was at least equal to (108 MPN g of
soil⫺1), if not larger than, the indigenous population and organisms were periodically inoculated throughout the experiment (Table 1). Moreover, the microbial population structure
of inoculated soil was very similar to that of the soil biostimulated with nutrients during the first 45 days, in which the
maximum biodegradation rates were observed. Therefore, the
indigenous population changed independent of the inoculum,
indicating that the biodegradation process was probably the strongest selection factor for the shifts in the microbial population.
Conclusions. This study showed that specific phylotypes of
bacteria are related both to inorganic nutrient addition to the
soil and to different phases of PAH degradation in a nonspiked
PAH-contaminated soil, and it highlighted the importance of
understanding how interspecies interactions, nutrient effects,
and changes in PAH bioavailability and recalcitrance influence
the degradation capability and structure of a microbial community.

could have inhibited the biodegradation of high-molecularweight PAHs. In fact, Rhykerd et al. (27) described a reduction
in bioremediation of a motor oil due to an increase in the
salinity produced by NaCl, and Braddock et al. (10) attributed
a reduction in the microbial activity of an Arctic hydrocarboncontaminated soil to the salinity produced by an excess of
nutrients.
In a recent study, Roling-Wilfred et al. (29) suggested that
the addition of nutrients implies that there are differences in
hydrocarbon biodegradation rates and variations in the microbial population. Therefore, for the present study, the differential microbial population shifts due to different inorganic nutrient contents may also explain the different biodegradation
capabilities observed for biostimulation treatments with and
without nutrient addition.
Response of the microbial population to bioremediation of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. At early stages (0 to 45
days) of the bioremediation process, the addition of nutrients
caused significant increases in both the heterotrophic and
PAH-degrading microbial populations, while soil stimulated
only by aeration and optimum humidity exhibited smaller increases in the sizes of both populations and a marked delay in
the increase in microbial PAH degraders (Fig. 1). This difference in behavior is consistent with the kinetics of TPH depletion observed during the early stage (Table 2). As shown in
Table 2, a higher TPH degradation rate was observed for
treatments to which nutrients were added. In contrast, the
proportion of the PAH-degrading microbial population compared to the heterotrophic population for the treatment without nutrients increased noticeably at 21 and 45 days and
reached 100% at 135 days, while lower proportions were observed for treatments with nutrients (Fig. 1). In addition, at the
end of the experiment a larger PAH-degrading microbial population was observed for the treatment without nutrients.
Thus, the majority presence of microbial PAH degraders during the late stage could be linked to the higher TPH degradation rates observed, especially with more recalcitrant PAHs.
Both changes in PAH bioavailability and enrichment of more
recalcitrant PAHs could change the microbial population and
the multisubstrate interactions (8, 9, 14, 22).
We found 13 different genera that were related to DGGE
excised bands during biostimulation of a heavily PAH-contaminated soil: Sphingomonas, Azospirillum, Roseomonas, Brevundimonas, Trojanella, Agrobacterium, Alcaligenes, Xanthomonas, Achromobacter, Sinorhizobium, Erytrobacter, Cytophaga,
and Rhodococcus.
During the first stage of biodegradation in the 2M treatment
and the 4M treatment, the Sphingomonas and Azospirillum
phylotypes (␣-Proteoabacteria) were the dominant taxa (Table
4). Furthermore, the only two coincident DGGE bands for the
two treatments belong to these phylotypes (B2-11 ⫽ B4-12 and
B2-20 ⫽ B4-24). Therefore, taking into account that with both
treatments high levels of TPH and PAH biodegradation were
observed during the first 90 days, these phylotypes may be
linked to the fast biodegradation observed for acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, alkyl-phenanthrenes, fluoranthene, and pyrene. These results are consistent with those of Roling-Wilfred et al. (29) and Kasai et al.
(19), who observed strong dominance of ␣-Proteobacteria in
bacterial communities found in recently spilled oil in Nak-
