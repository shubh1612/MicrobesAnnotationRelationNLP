Abstract

Bioavailability of electron acceptors is probably the most limiting factor in the restoration of anoxic, contaminated environments. The oxidation of contaminants such as aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly in aquifers, often depends on the reduction of ferric iron or sulphate. We have previously detected a highly active fringe zone beneath a toluene plume at a tar-oil-contaminated aquifer in Germany, where a specialized community of contaminant degraders codominated by Desulfobulbaceae and Geobacteraceae had established. Although on-site geochemistry links degradation to sulphidogenic processes, dominating catabolic (benzylsuccinate synthase α-subunit, bssA) genes detected in situ appeared to be more related to those of Geobacter spp. Therefore, a stable isotope probing (SIP) incubation of sediment samples with 13C7-toluene and comparative electron acceptor amendment was performed. We introduce pyrosequencing of templates from SIP microcosms as a powerful new strategy in SIP gradient interpretation (Pyro-SIP). Our results reveal the central role of Desulfobulbaceae in sulphidogenic toluene degradation in situ, and affiliate the detected bssA genes to this lineage. This and the absence of 13C-labelled DNA of Geobacter spp. in SIP gradients preclude their relevance as toluene degraders in situ. In contrast, Betaproteobacteria related to Georgfuchsia spp. became labelled under iron-reducing conditions. Furthermore, secondary toluene degraders belonging to the Peptococcaceae detected in both treatments suggest the possibility of functional redundancy among anaerobic toluene degraders on site.
Introduction

Groundwater, a primary source of drinking water, is subject to contamination by a huge variety of anthropogenic compounds. Among them, petroleum derivates, especially aromatic ones, are significantly persistent. Therefore, degradation of compounds such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) by intrinsic aquifer microbial communities, specifically under anaerobic conditions, is of particular interest for the comprehension and prediction of natural attenuation. Anaerobic BTEX degradation is known to occur under different terminal electron-accepting processes such as nitrate, iron or sulphate reduction, and methanogenesis (Anderson & Lovley, 1997; Christensen et al., 2000). However, the co-occurrence of or competition between different degrader guilds in situ is not well understood. Clearly, the dominance of a given degrader lineage is assumed to be dictated by electron acceptor availability.

Previous evidence from a tar-oil-contaminated aquifer site in Germany has shown the establishment of a highly active anaerobic toluene-degrading microbial community at the lower fringe of a BTEX plume (Winderl et al., 2008; Anneser et al., 2010). Even though toluene degradation at the site is presumed to be driven by sulphate reduction (Anneser et al., 2008; Winderl et al., 2008), this community is codominated by microorganisms affiliated to the Desulfobulbaceae and the Geobacteraceae. Both deltaproteobacterial lineages are known to harbour anaerobic toluene degraders, but these are either sulphate- or iron-reducers (Meckenstock, 1999; Kane et al., 2002). At the same time, the dominating anaerobic toluene degradation genes (benzylsuccinate synthase α-subunit, bssA) detected at the site were more closely related to Geobacter-affiliated bssA than to other known sulphate-reducing degraders (Winderl et al., 2007). However, the utility of the bssA gene as a phylogenetic marker is not robust, as cases of lateral gene transfer of this gene have been reported (Shinoda et al., 2005; Winderl et al., 2007). Moreover, recent studies indicate that certain members of the Peptococcaceae (Clostridia), also relevant constituents of the respective lower plume fringe community (Winderl et al., 2008; Anneser et al., 2010), carry a previously unrecognized capacity for toluene degradation under iron- (Kunapuli et al., 2010) and sulphate-reducing conditions (Winderl et al., 2010).

To resolve this dilemma and to assign phylogenetically key toluene-degrading functionality and genes at this site, we conducted a stable isotope probing (SIP) experiment with fresh sediment samples taken in situ from the degradation-active lower plume fringe. Sediments were incubated in microcosms under amendment of 13C7-toluene and either sulphate or ferric iron as an electron acceptor. SIP allows the direct identification of environmental microorganisms degrading and assimilating carbon from a 13C-labelled hydrocarbon and, if conducted for DNA, affiliation of respective degradation genes (Lueders, 2010). We hypothesize that if both Desulfobulbaceae- and Geobacteraceae-related degraders are important in toluene degradation in situ, both will become labelled in the respective SIP incubations. However, if only one of the two lineages is important in the breakdown of toluene in situ, only this will be labelled while respiring the appropriate electron acceptor. In contrast, a different degrader lineage, not dominating (or important) in situ, could become detectable using the other oxidant. We test this hypothesis using a new combination of DNA-SIP and high-throughput pyrosequencing of amplicons from SIP incubations to identify the key toluene-degrading lineage in these sediments.
Materials and methods

Sampling site and sample acquisition

Sampling was performed within a well-studied (Anneser et al., 2008, 2010; Winderl et al., 2008) tar-oil-contaminated aquifer in Düsseldorf-Flingern, Germany, in September 2008. Sediments ranging between 6.9 and 7.75 m below the ground surface were sampled from intact direct-push liners and immediately dispensed into 1-L glass bottles full of anoxically autoclaved (under N2/CO2) deionized water. Bottles were directly closed without gaseous headspace to minimize oxygen exposure of sediments and transported to the laboratory under cooling (4 °C).
Incubation of sediments

Replicates (∼8 g wet weight) of homogeneously mixed sediment material were transferred (in an anoxic tent) into sterile 120-mL serum bottles containing 50 mL of artificial anoxic groundwater medium as described previously (Winderl et al., 2010). To ensure constantly low in situ-like concentrations of toluene during SIP incubation, 0.3 g of Amberlite XAD7 absorber resin in each microcosm was loaded with a total of 1 mM of either nonlabelled (12C) or fully labelled 13C7 toluene (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) (Winderl et al., 2010). Parallel incubation series were amended with either 10 mM of sodium sulphate or 40 mM of amorphous Fe(III) oxyhydroxide prepared by titration of a solution of FeCl3 to a pH of 7 with NaOH (Lovley & Phillips, 1986). Twelve replicate microcosms for each treatment were set up. Abiotic control bottles (autoclaved three times), amended with each electron acceptor and unlabelled toluene, were also prepared to exclude the occurrence of abiotic redox reactions. The bottles were incubated statically for over 4 months in the dark at 16 °C, which was close to in situ aquifer temperatures of 14–16 °C.
Process measurements

Liquid and gaseous samples were taken from replicate 12C- and 13C-toluene and control bottles to monitor toluene degradation weekly. Aqueous toluene and sulphide concentrations were determined as described previously (Winderl et al., 2010). Fe(II) was monitored from 100 μL liquid subsamples also as described previously (Bosch et al., 2010), using a Cary 50 Bio UV-Vis photometer (Varian, Darmstadt, Germany) at a wavelength of 508 nm. The formation of 13CO2 was followed via GC combustion-isotope ratio MS (GC-C-IRMS) on 15 μL samples taken from the head space of each bottle, as described previously (Winderl et al., 2010).
Nucleic acid extraction and ultracentrifugation

At selected time points, a pair of bottles (12C and 13C) for each electron acceptor series (sulphate, ferric iron) was sacrificed for DNA-SIP analyses. Sediment, XAD7 and biomass were collected by centrifugation at 3350 g at 4 °C for 10 min using a Megafuge 1.0 R (Heraeus Instruments, Hanau, Germany). Pellets were frozen immediately at −20 °C and DNA extracted as described previously (Winderl et al., 2008), with minor modifications (∼12 h of DNA precipitation at 4 °C instead of ∼4 h). For each single extract, replicate extractions were pooled in maximum 100 μL of elution buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and stored frozen (−20 °C) for downstream analyses.

Approximately 1 μg of PicoGreen-quantified (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) DNA extract was loaded onto a gradient medium of CsCl (average density 1.71 g mL−1, Calbiochem, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in gradient buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl at pH 8, 0.1 M KCl, 1 mM EDTA) and centrifuged (180 000 g, ∼65 h) as described elsewhere in detail (Lueders, 2010; Winderl et al., 2010). Thirteen fractions from each gradient were collected from ‘heavy’ to ‘light’ using a Perfusor V syringe pump (Braun, Melsungen, Germany). Refractometric measurement of fraction buoyant density (BD) and the recovery of DNA from gradient fractions were also performed as published (Lueders, 2010).
Analyses of density-resolved DNA fractions

Recovered DNA from CsCl gradient fractions was analysed by bacterial 16S rRNA gene-targeted qPCR in the presence of 0.1 × SYBR Green as described (Kunapuli et al., 2007). Most fractions from each gradient were selected for bacterial 16S rRNA gene-targeted terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprinting. FAM-labelled amplicons were generated with the primers Ba27f (5′FAM-aga gtt tga tcm tgg ctc ag-3′) and 907r (5′-ccg tca att cct ttg agt tt-3′) in a Mastercycler ep gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with the following cycling conditions: initial denaturation (94 °C, 5 min), followed by 24 or 28 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 30 s), annealing (52 °C, 30 s) and elongation (70 °C, 60 s). Each 50 μL PCR reaction contained 1 × PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dNTPs, 1.25 U recombinant Taq polymerase (all from Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany), 0.2 μg μL−1 bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Roche, Penzberg, Germany), 0.5 μM of each primer (Biomers, Ulm, Germany) and 1 μL of template DNA. Amplicons were restricted using MspI and separated by capillary electrophoresis as reported (Lueders et al., 2006). Electropherograms were evaluated as described (Winderl et al., 2008). In addition, density-resolved DNA was also subjected to bacterial bssA gene fingerprinting. This was conducted with the 7772f/8546r-FAM primer pair as described (Winderl et al., 2010), but with a PCR annealing temperature of 58 °C (Winderl et al., 2007). Amplicons were digested with TaqI, while PCR chemistry and the remaining procedures were as for 16S fingerprints.
Amplicon pyrosequencing from SIP microcosms

Amplicon pyrosequencing was performed on unfractionated total DNA extracted from 13C-microcosms. Barcoded amplicons for multiplexing were prepared with the primers Ba27f (5′-aga gtt tga tcm tgg ctc ag-3′) and Ba519r (5′-tat tac cgc ggc kgc tg-3′) (Lane, 1991) extended as amplicon fusion primers with respective primer A or B adapters, key sequence and multiplex identifiers (MID) as recommended by 454/Roche (http://454.com/products-solutions/experimental-design-options/amplicon-sequencing.asp). Amplicons were generated under the same cycling conditions as described above for T-RFLP. Each 50 μL PCR reaction contained 1 × PCR buffer, 1.44 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dNTPs, 1% dimethyl sulphoxide, 1.25 U Taq polymerase (all from FastStart High Fidelity Taq DNA Polymerase kit, Roche), 0.32 μg μL−1 BSA (Roche), 0.3 μM of each MID-primer (Biomers) and 1 μL of template DNA. Amplicons were purified and pooled as specified by the manufacturer. Emulsion PCR, emulsion breaking and sequencing were performed applying the GS FLX Titanium chemistry following protocols and using a 454 GS FLX pyrosequencer (Roche) as recommended by the developer. For this study, two amplicons were sequenced in a pool of 14 mixed amplicons on 1/8th of an FLX picotitre plate. Quality filtering of the pyrosequencing reads was performed using the automatic amplicon pipeline of the GS Run Processor (Roche), with a modification of the valley filter (vfScanAllFlows false instead of TiOnly) to extract sequences.

Afterwards, reads were further quality-trimmed using the trim function of greengenes (DeSantis et al., 2006) with the following settings: good-quality score 20, window size 40 bp and window threshold 90%. Subsequently, reads were batched per sample based on MID-identifiers with bioedit (Hall, 1999) and reads with inferior read length (<250 bp) were excluded from further analysis. The total community composition was classified via read affiliation using the RDP classifier (Wang et al., 2007) at a confidence threshold of 70%. Read abundance percentage of classified lineages was recorded.

For downstream analysis of sequenced amplicon pools (T-RF prediction, phylogenetic inference), matching sequences from forward- and reverse-reads were assembled into contigs with the seqman II software (DNAStar) using assembly thresholds of at least 98% sequence similarity over a 50-bp match window. Contigs without at least one forward and one reverse read were not considered for further analysis. Selected dominating amplicon contigs were then integrated into an arb (Ludwig et al., 2004) database (version SSURef-95, July 2008). Sequences were aligned using automated aligners in the arb_edit4 editor. For phylogenetic affiliation, a ‘backbone’ tree based on selected full-length (>1200 bp) reference sequences of cultivated and uncultivated taxa was constructed using quartet puzzling as described previously (Kunapuli et al., 2010). Subsequently, shorter sequences including the selected amplicon contigs were added to the tree using the arb parsimony tool, thereby maintaining the overall tree topology.

T-RFs of amplicon contigs were predicted using arb_edit4. Possible deviations between predicted and measured T-RFs were handled by referring to our previous thorough verification of lineage-specific T-RFs by direct T-RFLP analysis of cloned amplicons generated from the same contaminated site (Winderl et al., 2008). In summary, this new bidirectional amplicon pyrosequencing approach allows the integrated evaluation of pyrosequencing results from the phylogenetic placement of representative assembled dominating amplicon sequences to T-RF matching. All raw and trimmed reads generated in this study have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE25449. The selected amplicon contigs used for phylogenetic analysis have been deposited at GenBank under the accession numbers HQ625653–HQ625672.
Results

Exposure of aquifer sediments to 13C-toluene

Figure 1 shows the evolution of major redox species during SIP incubation. Increasing concentrations of sulphide, with a rapid increase up to 2.8 mM between the 10th and the 12th week, were paralleled by a steep increase in 13CO2 (up to ∼12 atom percent, AT%) in sulphate-amended 13C-toluene microcosms. In contrast, iron(III)-amended microcosms showed a primary increase of Fe2+ up to ∼9 mM during the first 6 weeks, followed by a secondary, slower increase to up to ∼15 mM until the end of the experiment. Only this secondary increase of Fe2+ was connected to an increase in 13CO2 concentrations, albeit to much lower ratios (only ∼4 AT%) than under sulphate amendment. 12C-toluene microcosms showed comparable dynamics of reduced electron acceptors.

Means of triplicate microcosms are given +SE. Arrows indicate the time point chosen for DNA-SIP analyses.
The time course of toluene consumption was not detectable due to the presence of the XAD7 carrier resin, as described before (Winderl et al., 2010). Although toluene was present with a nominal total concentration of ∼1 mM, desorbed free aqueous concentrations varied around ∼50 μM for most of the incubation time. Complete toluene depletion was observed in the sulphate-reducing incubations after the 13th week, while ∼35 μM remained detectable in the iron-reducing incubations by the end of the experiment (15th week). Autoclaved controls did not show significant abiotic reactions, with sulphide concentration not exceeding ∼0.1 mM and iron(II) concentration not exceeding ∼4.6 mM. As observed previously for electron balances in similar SIP microcosms (Winderl et al., 2010), sulphate microcosms ended with ∼60% of the electrons from the added toluene recovered in sulphide and ∼85% of the added labelled carbon recovered as 13CO2. In iron incubations, only ∼42% of the added electrons from toluene were recaptured in ferrous iron, and <30% of the carbon from 13C-toluene was recovered as 13CO2 (both assuming complete toluene oxidation).
Detection and identification of 13C-labelled degraders

One late time point, when substantial respiration and mineralization activities had been observed in both SIP incubation series (after 13 weeks), was selected for the detection of labelled DNA by isopycnic ultracentrifugation. This choice was driven mainly by the iron-reducing microcosms, where significant shifts in 13CO2 were not detectable earlier. Nevertheless, clear BD shifts compared with the respective 12C-control gradients and enrichment of bacterial DNA, especially in ‘intermediate’ gradient fractions, were appreciable in SIP gradients from both incubation series (Fig. 2).

 Quantitative profiles of DNA distribution, measured via 16S rRNA gene qPCR, in comparative SIP gradients of DNA from microcosms amended with unlabelled (12C) toluene or 13C7-toluene and sulphate or ferric iron.
It was possible to detect clear distinctions between ‘light’ and ‘heavy’ DNA fractions of 13C-gradients (Fig. 3) in bacterial community fingerprints. Thus, ‘intermediate’ and ‘heavy’ fractions of DNA from 13C-toluene sediments showed a dominance of especially the 159 bp, but also the 146- and 177-bp T-RFs. At the same time, ‘light’ fractions showed selection for the 163- and 469-bp T-RFs. In contrast, all major T-RFs were detected in all gradient fractions from the sulphate-amended 12C-toluene control. In the ferric iron SIP microcosms, bulk DNA from 12C-control gradients was dominated mainly by two T-RFs: the 159- and 430-bp fragments. Also, other fragments, such as the 288-bp T-RF, were detected in ‘lighter’, low GC-content DNA fractions (Fig. 3). In contrast, while ‘light’ bulk DNA in 13C-gradients was still dominated by the 159-bp T-RF, the 288- and 430-bp fragments were of greater relative abundance in ‘intermediate’ and ‘heavy’ gradient fractions. Therefore, especially the latter seemed to represent microorganisms involved in ferric iron-dependent toluene degradation.

The lengths (bp) of selected T-RFs are given. Numbers in parentheses are CsCl BDs (g mL−1) of gradient fractions.
To identify the bacterial lineages represented by T-RFs from density-resolved SIP gradient fractions, barcoded amplicon pyrosequencing (Miller et al., 2009; Quince et al., 2009) of two representative bulk DNA extracts was performed. Table 1 summarizes the total pyrosequencing read, trimming and contig assembly statistics for the two amplicon pools, while Table 2 illustrates the comprehensive affiliation of reads and that of deduced T-RFs. SIP microcosm communities were mainly composed of reads within the Delta-, Beta- and Epsilonproteobacteria, and also the Clostridia. Sulphate-amended samples showed high relative abundances of sequences within the Desulfobulbaceae (29%), Desulfosporosinus spp. (21%) and Sulfuricurvum spp. (13%). In contrast, abundant reads affiliated to Thermincola spp. (16%), unclassified Desulfobacterales (9%), the Rhodocyclaceae (7%), Comamonadaceae (13%) and Actinobacteria (4%) constituted clear community distinctions detectable in the ferric iron SIP incubations.

The phylogenetic placement of important amplicon contigs assembled from dominating pyrosequencing reads is illustrated in Fig. 4. In combination with T-RFs previously predicted and measured for cloned bacterial rRNA genes from the same site (Winderl et al., 2008), a comprehensive affiliation of T-RFs detected in density-resolved DNA gradient fractions to defined lineages was possible. Almost all the peaks present in the electropherograms could actually be matched to pyrosequencing read data. Thus, the 159-, 146- and 177-bp T-RFs identified as 13C-labelled under sulphate amendment represented amplicons originating from members of the Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfosporosinus spp. (Table 2). In contrast, the 163- and 469-bp T-RFs dominating in ‘light’ fractions were affiliated to Sulfuricurvum spp. The 288- and 430-bp fragments with increased abundance in ‘heavy’ ferric iron SIP DNA represented amplicons related to Thermincola spp. and within the Rhodocyclaceae. In contrast, the 159-bp T-RF dominating in ‘light’ fractions of the same treatments was affiliated to a second cluster of unclassified Desulfobulbaceae, which was distinct from the labelled sequence types from the same family found under sulphate reduction. However, the primary Desulfobulbaceae-related sequence type dominating in sulphate-reducing SIP microcosms was also detected in iron-reducing incubations, albeit much less abundant (Table 2, Fig. 4).

bssA genes detected in SIP gradient fractions

Finally, we aimed to affiliate the bssA genes previously detected in situ, tentatively named the ‘F1-lineage’ (Winderl et al., 2007), to either key sulphate- or iron-reducing toluene degraders detected in SIP incubations. For this, we performed bssA-targeted T-RFLP fingerprinting of density-resolved DNA gradient fractions, to screen for and identify bssA sequence types via T-RFs. For the hitherto unidentified ‘F1-lineage’ of bssA genes, TaqI restriction of amplicons produces a 478-bp T-RF, which was found to dominate the fractions of density-resolved DNA from sulphate- and iron-reducing SIP microcosms (Fig. 5). Additionally, an as yet unidentified 248-bp T-RF was found in DNA fractions from sulphate treatments and a further unidentified 77-bp T-RF in fractions from iron treatments.

Discussion

The aim of this study was to unravel whether Desulfobulbaceae- or Geobacteraceae-related putative toluene degraders detected at the highly active lower fringe of a contaminant plume (Winderl et al., 2008) are actually important in onsite toluene degradation, and to affiliate the previously detected ‘F1-lineage’ of bssA genes (Winderl et al., 2007) to one of these lineages. This objective was pursued using a novel combination of DNA-SIP and high-throughput pyrosequencing of amplicons from SIP microcosms. For the first time, this strategy was used in combination with T-RFLP fingerprinting of SIP gradient DNA to identify relevant degraders. We used freshly sampled sediments containing a diverse in situ aquifer degrader community as inoculum, which contrasts our study with other recent reports, where SIP has been applied to less complex laboratory cultures of anaerobic BTEX degraders (Kunapuli et al., 2007; Oka et al., 2008; Bombach et al., 2010; Herrmann et al., 2010). Both parallel SIP incubations required considerable lag phases before biodegradation became noticeable, as observed previously (Winderl et al., 2010), and attributed to transfer and adaptation among degraders during SIP incubation. In addition, the lack of recovered CO2 and electrons from the added toluene may indicate the parallel involvement of fermenters and methanogens in toluene breakdown, which cannot be excluded, but seems unlikely, because sulphate and ferric iron were added in nonlimiting quantities for toluene oxidation.

Once activated, the selective role of electron acceptor availability was especially apparent for sulphate-reducing degraders, where high sulphate reduction and toluene oxidation rates were observed over a short period of time. SIP in combination with amplicon pyrosequencing revealed that degraders within the Desulfobulbaceae, a lineage well known to dominate at the lower plume fringe in situ (Winderl et al., 2008; Anneser et al., 2010), and for which cultivated toluene-degrading isolates (Meckenstock, 1999) and enrichments (Bombach et al., 2010) have been described, were highly represented in the ‘heavy’ DNA fractions from sulphate-reducing microcosms. Thus, their central role in sulphidogenic toluene degradation in situ is unambiguously demonstrated. Moreover, the low abundance of Geobacter-related sequences (0.2%) in amplicon libraries from these incubations clearly precludes an affiliation of the ‘F1’ bssA lineage to degraders within the Geobacteraceae. Therefore, an affiliation of the ‘F1’ bssA lineage to the detected degraders within the Desulfobulbaceae seems warranted, even though a phylogenetically distinct bssA sequence type has been observed previously for other degraders within the Desulfobulbaceae (Winderl et al., 2007; Jehmlich et al., 2010). This strongly indicates another example of lateral gene transfer for this catabolic marker (Shinoda et al., 2005; Winderl et al., 2007), which clearly limits its identification potential for unknown catabolic homologues detected in environmental gene libraries. However, this affiliation must be interpreted with caution before isolation of a pure culture of these new Desulfobulbaceae-affiliated degraders, or at least until (meta-) genomic sequence data linking both markers are obtained.

A secondary population of sulphate-reducing toluene degraders identified in SIP gradients was related to Desulfosporosinus spp. within the Peptococcaceae. Although detected, but not abundant in clone libraries previously generated from in situ sediment samples (Winderl et al., 2008), the capacity of members of this genus for anaerobic toluene degradation has already been demonstrated (Liu et al., 2004; Winderl et al., 2010). Their detection as secondary degraders in SIP suggests the possibility of functional redundancy among sulphate-reducing toluene degraders in situ.

An important unlabelled lineage detected in the sulphate-reducing microcosms was Sulfuricurvum spp. within the Epsilonproteobacteria. These microorganisms are normally capable of sulphide oxidation coupled to reduction of nitrate or oxygen (Kodama & Watanabe, 2004; Campbell et al., 2006). Although traces of nitrate could have been present in our microcosms, they would not have sustained abundant sulphide-oxidizing populations, as indicated by pyrosequencing reads. Intriguingly, similar Epsilonproteobacteria have been detected recently in sulphate-reducing, toluene- and benzene-degrading enrichment cultures (Kleinsteuber et al., 2008; Müller et al., 2009), where their function also remained unclear (Herrmann et al., 2010).

In iron-reducing SIP microcosms, specific toluene degradation activities and electron recoveries appeared much lower, unsurprisingly, as added toluene was apparently not completely oxidized during incubation. The dominating labelled phylotype of iron-reducing toluene degraders detected in SIP was related to the genus Thermincola within the Peptococcaceae (288-bp T-RF). Relatives of this lineage have also been identified recently as iron-reducing benzene degraders (Kunapuli et al., 2007), but their involvement in toluene degradation has not been described to date. Another labelled phylotype detected in our DNA gradients was within the Rhodocyclaceae. Recently, a novel iron-reducing betaproteobacterial toluene degrader, Georgfuchsia toluolica, has been isolated (Weelink et al., 2009) from a BTEX-contaminated aquifer. The sequence type represented by the 430-bp T-RF clustered close to Ferrovum myxofaciens (Hallberg et al., 2006) and G. toluolica within the Rhodocyclaceae. Therefore, the diversity of iron-reducing BTEX degraders within the Betaproteobacteria may also be larger than recognized previously.

Because the signatures of both Georgfuchsia- and Thermincola-related degraders (the 430- and 288-bp T-RFs) were hardly detectable in the respective aquifer sediments (Winderl et al., 2008), this illustrates their enrichment as iron-reducing toluene degraders during our SIP incubation. In contrast, the Geobacteraceae shown to be dominant in situ (Winderl et al., 2008; Anneser et al., 2010), and that were also abundant (∼15% relative T-RF abundance at the lower plume fringe) in the samples used for SIP incubation (data not shown), do not appear to be directly involved in on-site toluene breakdown. Likely, these abundant Geobacteraceae catabolize some of the other electron donors potentially provided by the plume (e.g. hydrocarbons other than toluene, fatty acids). Also at the BTEX-contaminated aquifer from which G. toluolica was isolated (Weelink et al., 2009), members of the Geobacteraceae are widespread and abundant, but not directly involved in toluene breakdown (Staats et al., 2011).

If Geobacter populations are not involved in toluene oxidation in situ, this again supports linking the ‘F1-lineage’ of bssA genes (Winderl et al., 2008) to the Desulfobulbaceae as key toluene degraders in the Flingern sediments. As mentioned above, these Desulfobulbaceae-related degraders were also found (albeit unlabelled) in the iron-reducing incubations. Therefore, the detection of the ‘F1-lineage’ sequence type in both DNA gradients seems warranted. At the same time, no known bssA sequence types were inferable from DNA gradients for the clostridial and betaproteobacterial toluene degraders detected in surplus. Here, we cannot be sure that the primer pair utilized for bssA-fingerprinting is actually capable of detecting all relevant fumarate-adding gene lineages potentially present in our SIP microcosms. Although the primer set has been demonstrated to detect readily the bssA of most known iron- and sulphate-reducing toluene degraders (Winderl et al., 2007), primer development and optimization for the detection of fumarate-adding catabolic genes is still an ongoing process.

In summary, our results unambiguously reveal the central role of Desulfobulbaceae in toluene degradation at the lower plume fringe at the Flingern contaminated aquifer. Second, we substantiate the absence of true iron-reducing toluene-degrading populations in the same zone, because only degraders not previously detected or abundant in situ were identified in SIP. Interestingly, secondary toluene degraders within the Peptococcaceae detected under both sulphate- and iron-reducing conditions give rise to speculations about niche differentiation or functional redundancy among degradative potentials on site. Finally, we show that new technologies such as amplicon pyrosequencing can be of substantial benefit for the assignment of catabolic capacities to defined lineages in SIP. Hence, amplicon pyrosequencing in combination with fingerprinting of density-resolved nucleic acids was established as a powerful new strategy in SIP gradient interpretation.
