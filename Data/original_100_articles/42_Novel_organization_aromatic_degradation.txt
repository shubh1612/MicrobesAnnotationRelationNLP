Novel organization of aromatic degradation pathway genes in a microbial community as revealed by metagenomic analysis

Abstract

Several types of environmental bacteria that can aerobically degrade various aromatic compounds have been identified. The catabolic genes in these bacteria have generally been found to form operons, which promote efficient and complete degradation. However, little is known about the degradation pathways in bacteria that are difficult to culture in the laboratory. By functionally screening a metagenomic library created from activated sludge, we had earlier identified 91 fosmid clones carrying genes for extradiol dioxygenase (EDO), a key enzyme in the degradation of aromatic compounds. In this study, we analyzed 38 of these fosmids for the presence and organization of novel genes for aromatics degradation. Only two of the metagenomic clones contained complete degradation pathways similar to those found in known aromatic compound-utilizing bacteria. The rest of the clones contained only subsets of the pathway genes, with novel gene arrangements. A circular 36.7-kb DNA form was assembled from the sequences of clones carrying genes belonging to a novel EDO subfamily. This plasmid-like DNA form, designated pSKYE1, possessed genes for DNA replication and stable maintenance as well as a small set of genes for phenol degradation; the encoded enzymes, phenol hydroxylase and EDO, are capable of the detoxification of aromatic compounds. This gene set was found in 20 of the 38 analyzed clones, suggesting that this ‘detoxification apparatus’ may be widespread in the environment.

Introduction

The ability to use various aromatic compounds to serve as sources of carbon and energy is widespread in bacteria, and in the natural environment these bacteria contribute greatly to the breakdown of aromatic compounds and to the global carbon cycle (Wittich, 1998; Esteve-Núñez et al., 2001; Furukawa et al., 2004). The majority of reported bacterial aromatic degradation processes are aerobic (Gibson and Harwood, 2002) and comprise series of enzymes that are usually categorized as either ‘upper’- or ‘lower’-pathway enzymes (Williams and Sayers, 1994). Generally, the enzymes in the upper pathway transform aromatic compounds to aromatic vicinal diols. This initial hydroxylation step is performed by a monoxygenase or dioxygenase that incorporates an oxygen atom(s) into the aromatic ring (Gibson and Parales, 2000). The second enzyme in the upper pathway is dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the conversion of dihydrodiol to dihydroxy compound. In the lower pathway, the resulting dihydroxylated aromatic compounds are transformed into ring-cleavage products by either extradiol dioxygenases (EDOs) or intradiol dioxygenases. The subsequent metabolic steps are referred to as meta- or ortho- pathways. Of these dioxygenases, EDOs can easily be identified due to their yellow pigmentation of the products and have been extensively studied (Eltis and Bolin, 1996). The ring-cleavage products are further degraded into compounds that can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

The genes encoding upper- and lower-pathway enzymes are often clustered into operons, and the varied combinations of upper and lower pathways provide diverse functions. Point mutations in conjunction with various gene rearrangements (for example, insertion, deletion, duplication and inversion) further promote the functional diversity of genes and gene clusters (van der Meer et al., 1992). The presence of foreign compounds can lead to the selection of mutant bacteria that are capable of metabolizing them. Aromatic catabolism genes are often harbored by mobile genetic elements (for example, plasmids, transposons and integrative and conjugative elements) that effectively disseminate the catabolic traits to phylogenetically diverse bacteria (Tsuda et al., 1999; Top and Springael, 2003; Nojiri et al., 2004).

However, because the generalizations described above come only from studies of those bacteria that can be cultivated under standard laboratory conditions, they are probably biased. As the vast majority (>99%) of bacteria in the natural environment are difficult to culture in the laboratory, and are thought to differ greatly from known cultured ones (Amann et al., 1995), the not-yet cultivated bacteria may possess novel genes, enzymes or pathways. In addition, the aromatic compound-degrading bacteria thus far analyzed were isolated on the basis of their ability to utilize aromatics as their sole carbon and energy sources. This approach can isolate only those bacteria that possess all of the genes necessary to completely degrade aromatic compounds. Efforts have been made to directly obtain genes and pathways for aromatics catabolism using methods independent of bacterial culture (Galvao et al., 2005; Mohn et al., 2006). For example, Junca and Pieper (2004) and Sipilä et al. (2008) relied on a PCR-based approach to assess the diversity of EDO genes in the environment. However, these sequence-driven approaches still suffer from bias, in this case from the primer sequences selected for PCR.

To overcome these drawbacks, we previously employed a function-driven metagenomic approach (Suenaga et al., 2007). Using environmental DNA samples prepared from an activated sludge used to treat coke plant wastewater containing various aromatic compounds, we constructed a metagenomic fosmid library in Escherichia coli. Using catechol as a substrate, we screened the library for EDO activities. Of the resulting 91 fosmid clones expressing EDO activities, 38 were subjected to DNA sequencing, which resulted in the identification of 43 EDO genes. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of these EDOs with those of previously reported EDOs revealed that more than half (25) of our newly identified EDOs were from novel subfamilies: I.1.C (2 clones), I.2.G (20 clones), I.3.M (2 clones) and I.3.N (1 clone). This result suggested a striking difference between the aromatics-degradation genes in our target microbial community and those that were previously identified in known bacteria through culture-dependent approaches. In this study, we investigated the organization of the degradation pathway genes in the 38 sequenced fosmid clones.

DNA sequencing and gene annotation

Shotgun DNA sequencing was performed at the Dragon Genomics Center (Mie, Japan) as described previously (Suenaga et al., 2007). Sequences were assembled using Paracel Transcript Assembler software (Paracel Inc., Pasadena, CA, USA). Open reading frames (ORFs) were identified using Artemis software (Rutherford et al., 2000), which was also used to calculate %(G+C) content. BLAST searches (Altschul et al., 1997) were carried out against the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank DNA databases, and the final ORF annotations were made manually. Conserved amino acid sequences were identified using the InterProScan (Quevillon et al., 2005) and Pfam (Finn et al., 2008) programs. A tRNA gene search was carried out using the tRNAscan-SE program (Lowe and Eddy, 1997). Self-organization map (SOM) analysis (Abe et al., 2003) was performed using each 5-kb DNA window of inserts as a query. Pairwise nucleotide sequence comparisons were made and visualized using the GenomeMatcher program (Ohtsubo et al., 2008). The nucleotide sequences reported here have been deposited in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession numbers AB266111–AB266148 and AB471759–AB471780.
Functional characterization of selected degradation gene clusters

PCR-mediated subcloning was used to clone some of the degradation pathway genes from fosmids 2C5 and 9C3 and from the fosmids carrying I.2.G subfamily EDOs. PCR was carried out with oligonucleotide primers (Supplementary Table S1). The amplicons were digested with XbaI and cloned into the XbaI site (2C5) or XbaI–HincII site (9C3 and I.2.G EDO genes) of pUC18 so that transcription of the inserted genes was under the control of the vector-derived lac promoter. E. coli JM109 cells carrying the recombinant plasmids were grown at 37 °C in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium (Sambrook and Russell, 2001) containing 50 μg ml−1 ampicillin and 0.1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside.

As no rRNA genes were found, the microbial origins of the insert fragments were predicted by SOM (self-organization map) analysis, which suggested that the majority of the metagenomic fragments originated from phylum Proteobacteria. This finding might represent an initial screening bias resulting from the use of E. coli as the host. The predicted functions of the 1317 ORFs are summarized in Table 2, and a complete list of ORFs describing their position, %(G+C) content, predicted function, predicted microbial origin and closest homologs in public databases is shown in Supplementary Table S2. When the 1317 ORFs were classified on the basis of their predicted function and compared with those identified in purely cultivated aromatics-utilizing bacteria, the metagenomic DNA fragments displayed a lower proportion of aromatics-degrading genes and a higher proportion of genes for replication/maintenance/processing of DNA, conjugative transfer and DNA transposition and site-specific recombination than those in the genomes of cultivated strains. The details are described in the Supplementary information and in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4.

Diverse genetic organization of aromatic degradation genes in metagenomic DNA

The genetic organization of representative fosmid inserts is depicted in Figure 1, and the details of the ORFs for all fosmid inserts are shown in Supplementary Figures S1, S2 and S3. Most EDO genes were flanked by genes or gene clusters predicted to be involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds. These gene products showed moderate to significant levels of identity with well-studied catabolic enzymes from isolated bacteria; these enzymes included Dmp proteins from the phenol-catabolizing plasmid pVI150 of Pseudomonas sp. CF600 (Shingler et al., 1992), Phe proteins from the phenol-utilizing strain Bacillus thermoglucosidasius A7 (Duffner et al., 2000), Tdn proteins from the aniline-catabolizing plasmid pTDN1 of P. putida UCC22 (Fukumori and Saint, 2001), Nah proteins from the naphthalene-catabolizing plasmid NAH7 of P. putida G7 (Sota et al., 2006a) and Nag proteins from the naphthalene-utilizing strain Ralstonia sp. U2 (Zhou et al., 2001). Schematic drawings of these pathways are shown in Figures 2, 3, 4 and 5. Notably, (i) these known aromatics degraders generally carry one or two well-organized gene clusters that allow the complete degradation of aromatic compounds to pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, and (ii) the gene clusters are usually arranged according to the order of the reactions. We refer to these representative pathways identified in isolates in discussing the properties of our fosmid fragments below.

Fosmids carrying I.2.A EDO genes 

A representative EDO belonging to the I.2.A subfamily is catechol 2,3-dioxygenase. I.2.A EDOs are frequently found in Pseudomonas spp. and are involved in the degradation of single-ring aromatic compounds (for example, phenol and toluene) and naphthalene (Eltis and Bolin, 1996). The first step in bacterial phenol degradation is, in most cases, monohydroxylation of phenol at the ortho-position to form catechol. This reaction is performed by a phenol hydroxylase comprising a single component (such as PheA from B. stearothermophilus BR219 (Kim and Oriel, 1995)), two components (such as PheAB from B. thermoglucosidasius A7 (Duffner et al., 2000)), or multiple components (such as DmpKLMNOP from pVI150 (Shingler et al., 1992)) (Figures 2 and 5).

Plasmid pVI150 carries a catabolic dmp operon containing 15 structural genes that encode a multicomponent-type phenol hydroxylase (DmpKLMNOP) and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (DmpB). The complete degradation of the 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde formed by the DmpB reaction is carried out by the enzymes encoded by dmpCDEHFGI. Among our metagenomic fosmid inserts, I.2.A EDO genes were found in five fosmids that were classified into three subtypes (2C5, 3A2 and 5F10) depending on their genetic organization (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1).

The fosmid 2C5 appears to contain dmpKLMNOPQBCDEHFGI, a complete gene cluster comprising ORF2C5-7 to −13 and ORF2C5-15 to −22; this cluster encodes polypeptides calculated to be 20–78% identical to the Dmp proteins of pVI150 (Figures 1 and 2). Upstream of this gene cluster is ORF2C5-23, which encodes a deduced polypeptide that is 61% identical to pVI150-encoded DmpR, a positive transcriptional regulator of the dmp operon (Figure 2). When the ORF2C5-15 to −22 cluster, presumably encoding phenol hydroxylase and EDO, was subcloned into pUC18, E. coli JM109 cells carrying the recombinant plasmid produced 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (detected by yellow coloration) on LB agar plates containing phenol, confirming the activities of the two enzymes.

The predicted products of ORF3A2-1, −3, −5 and −15 to −20 from fosmid 3A2 are 35–79% identical to two components of phenol hydroxylase (DmpOP) (ORF3A2-1 and −3), catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (DmpB) (ORF3A2-5) and the DmpCDEFGH proteins (ORF3A2-15 to −20) of pVI150 (Figure 1). The deduced gene product of ORF3A2-14, which was located upstream of dmpCDEFGH, is 43% identical to the Orf0 protein, a GntR-type transcriptional regulator of the biphenyl-catabolizing (bph) operon of P. pseudoalcaligenes KF707 (Watanabe et al., 2000). Fosmid types 3A2 and 2C5 differ remarkably in that the two dmp gene clusters in 3A2 are separated by an intervening 10-kb sequence that does not appear to be involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds. Therefore, the 3A2-type gene cluster may be an evolutionarily intermediate form of the 2C5-type complete operon. On the other hand, some other dmp genes may be located upstream of ORF3A2-1.

Fosmids 5F10, 2H2 and 9B1 have some DNA fragments in common (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). The nucleotide sequence of ORF5F10-3-encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase is identical to those of ORF26 in 6B9 (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S2) and ORF36 in 9E4 (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S3). The deduced gene products for ORF5F10-3, −5 and −6 show 56%, 60% and 66% identity to DmpB, DmpC and DmpE, respectively, of pVI150. In these fosmids, only these three ORFs were predicted to be involved in aromatics degradation. 5F10 contains four tRNA genes (for Pro, Arg, His and Lys), indicating that this DNA fragment is most probably of chromosomal origin (Figure 1).
Fosmids carrying I.2.B EDO genes 

EDOs belonging to subfamily I.2.B are frequently identified in the genus Sphingomonas. They include catechol 2,3-dioxygenases, involved in the degradation of single-ring aromatic compounds (for example, xylenes) (Eltis and Bolin, 1996). I.2.B EDO genes were borne on four fosmids, three of which (4D5, 1A9 and 6F5) had nearly an identical sequence; with the exception that 4D5 carried two I.2.B EDO genes (ORF4D5-30 and −31) (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1).

The deduced amino acid sequences of the ORF4D5-10 to −17 gene products are 37–70% identical to those of proteins involved in the degradation of phenol (DmpQBCEFGH of pVI150) and aniline (TdnD2C2-Orf4 product-TdnEGIJK of pTDN1 from P. putida UCC2) (Figure 1). However, no genes for putative phenol hydroxylase homologs were identified in the flanking regions, suggesting that the degradation gene cluster in 4D5 constitutes only part of a complete degradative pathway and is likely to work in concert with other upstream enzyme genes, which might be located at a distant locus in the same genome or provided by other organisms.

Fosmid 10D8 carries seven ORFs, ORF10D8-21, −22, −23, −26, −27, −28, −30, which encode polypeptides calculated to be 37–70% identical to the gene products of dmpBCEHFGD of pVI150 and tdnC2-Orf4-tdnEGKIJF of pTDN1 (Figure 1). ORF10D8-24 was predicted to be a GntR-type transcriptional regulator. Unlike other well-studied meta-pathway gene clusters, this putative regulator gene is positioned in the middle of the degradation gene cluster.
Fosmids carrying I.2.C EDO genes 

The EDOs of subfamily I.2.C are primarily catechol 2,3-dioxygenases responsible for the degradation of single-ring aromatic compounds (for example, phenol, nitrobenzene and aniline). This type of EDO is often found in β-Proteobacteria (Comamonas, Ralstonia and Burkholderia) and γ-Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas) (Eltis and Bolin, 1996). I.2.C EDO genes were found in all three of our metagenomic fosmid clones (3F10, 9C3 and 7D12).

The pTDN1-specified genes in the aniline-degrading meta-cleavage pathway constitute the operon tdnD1C(orf123)D2C2(orf4)EFGHIJKL (Fukumori and Saint, 2001) (Figure 3). Most of the deduced proteins encoded by ORF3F10-1 to −16 show extremely high amino acid identity (>94%) with these Tdn proteins (Figures 1 and 3). As is the case for pTDN1, 3F10 has two genes each for catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (ORF3F10-2 and −6) and ferredoxin (ORF3F10-1 and −5).

The deduced amino acid sequences of ORF9C3-19 to −35 are 54–100% identical to those of proteins encoded by pTDN1 (Figures 1 and 3). Unlike 3F10, the 9C3 fosmid contains single copies of the genes for catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and ferredoxin. To examine the activities of the ORF9C3-28 to −35 gene products, the gene cluster was subcloned into pUC18. E. coli JM109 cells carrying the recombinant plasmid produced 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (detected by yellow coloration) on LB agar plates containing aniline, confirming the activities of aniline dioxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase.

The aniline-catabolizing gene cluster on pTDN1 is flanked by IS1071 (Fukumori and Saint, 2001). IS1071 is preferentially located on broad host-range IncP-1β plasmids and can transpose in β-proteobacterial strains with high frequency (Sota et al., 2006b). Downstream of the degradation gene cluster on 9C3, two truncated IS1071 transposase genes (ORF9C3-3 and −14) flank a complete set of mercury-resistance genes, merRTPCADE (ORF9C3-4 to 10) (Figure 1). Because IncP-1β plasmids often carry mercury-resistance genes flanked by IS1071, the insert in 9C3 might have originated from an IncP-1β plasmid of β-proteobacterial origin, which is consistent with the SOM analysis result.

Four fosmids (7D12, 4E8, 6H11 and 9E5) had overlapping sequences (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). The deduced products of ORF7D12-39 to −44 show amino acid sequence identities of 71–83% with those of OrfX (unknown function), AphB (2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase), AphQ (unknown function), AphP (reductase component of phenol hydroxylase), AphO (hydroxylase component of phenol hydroxylase) and AphN (hydroxylase component of phenol hydroxylase) of the phenol-utilizing strain Comamonas testosteroni TA441 (Arai et al., 2000); these levels of identity are higher than those found for the DmpOPQB products of pVI150, which exhibit only 33–58% identity with these proteins.

Fosmid 7D12 contained two genes for ribosomal proteins, L13 (RplM, ORF7D12-15) and S9 (RpsI, ORF7D12-16); L13 and S9 are 90% and 87% identical, respectively, to a ribosomal protein of Acidvorax sp. JS42, indicating that this DNA fragment must have originated from a β-proteobacterial chromosome (Figure 1). ORF7D12-17, a putative gene (int) for tyrosine recombinase-type integrase that has highly conserved functional homologs in the Tn4371-like genomic islands (Toussaint et al., 2003), was located downstream of rplM. Likewise, the deduced amino acid sequences of the ORF7D12-26, −34, −35 and −38 gene products show 90% identity with those of ParB, RepA, ParA and TraF, respectively, of the Tn4371-like islands. Furthermore, a conserved target site (5′-TTTTCAT-3′) for Tn4371 insertion was found in the intergenic region between the rplM and int genes, which might constitute one end of the Tn4371-like genomic islands. Therefore, the 22-kb region downstream of rplM is likely to be part of a Tn4371-like genomic island that contains the aph operon.
Fosmids carrying I.1.C and I.3.M EDO genes 

We recently proposed the I.1.C and I.3.M EDO subfamilies on the basis of their novel amino acid sequences (Suenaga et al., 2007). A DNA fragment containing the I.1.C EDO gene was found in both fosmids 4A3 and 6B9, and a fragment containing the I.3.M EDO gene was found in both 7E11 and 8C3 (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S2). Strikingly, degradation genes other than these EDO genes were not identified in the fosmid inserts. ORF7E11-1, −2 and −3 appear to constitute an operon with the I.3.M EDO gene (ORF7E11-4). The former three genes were annotated as the genes for a hypothetical protein, hydantoin racemase and fumarate reductase flavoprotein subunit, respectively, but functions of these ORFs for the degradation of aromatic compounds remain unclear. Although there are some examples of functionally related catabolic genes being dispersed on chromosomes and plasmids (for example, Rhodococcus spp. and sphingomonads) (van der Geize and Dijkhuizen, 2004; Basta et al., 2005), the ‘solitary’-type gene structure identified in these fosmids has not previously been documented.
Fosmids carrying I.3.N EDO genes 

The EDO (ORF1F2-17 product) encoded by fosmid 1F2 belongs to the novel subfamily I.3.N (Suenaga et al., 2007). Sixteen genes (ORF1F2-3 to −7 and −16 to −26) in the fosmid were categorized as involved in aromatics degradation (Figures 1 and 4). Of these 16 genes, nine (ORF1F2-7, −16, −17, −20, −21, −23 to −26) encoded products predicted to have 27–53% amino acid sequence identity with those of the enzymes for naphthalene degradation encoded by the nah genes of plasmid NAH7 from P. putida G7 (Sota et al., 2006a) and the nag genes of Ralstonia sp. U2 (Zhou et al., 2001). However, these 16 genes are apparently not sufficient to constitute a complete pathway for naphthalene degradation (Figure 4). Although the EDO sequence of ORF1F2-17 is only 19% identical to that of NAH7-encoded NahH (catechol 2,3-dioxygenase), the ORF1F2-17 gene product actually cleaves catechol at the meta-position (Suenaga et al., 2007). Thus, the ORF1F2-16 to −26 products seem to constitute a nah-nag chimeric pathway for degradation of salicylate (compound 8 in Figure 4). E. coli EPI300 cells carrying the 1F2 fosmid grown in LB medium containing chloramphenicol were able to transform phenol, but not naphthalene, to its meta-cleavage yellow product. Despite these experimental results, no 1F2 fosmid genes were found to be homologs of known genes for phenol hydroxylase or its components. Therefore, the fosmid appears to contain novel phenol hydroxylase genes; the candidate genes are ORF1F2-3 (4-hydroxybenzoate 3-monoxygenase), ORF1F2-4 (ferredoxin), ORF1F2-5 (aromatic compound dioxygenase), ORF1F2-18 (reductase) and ORF1F2-19 (hydroxylase).
Fosmids carrying I.2.G EDO genes 

In the 38 fosmids, genes of the novel I.2.G EDO subfamily were overrepresented, constituting 18 clones (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S3). (The complete sequences of functional EDO genes in the 3G3 fosmid were not obtained because of failure during contig assembly.) This dominance of the I.2.G subfamily suggests that this type of novel EDO may have an important role in our target environment (that is, coke plant wastewater habitat). All of the 18 fosmids (except for 3G3) carried a set of three genes encoding single-component-type phenol hydroxylase, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase, in that order (Table 3). The 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase genes on these fosmids were apparently either intact or truncated at the 3′-end. The fosmids containing an apparently intact 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase gene tended to carry an additional homologous copy downstream. Such genes, for example, ORF2C1-27 and −29 in fosmid 2C1, were 59% identical to each other in nucleotide sequence and their respective products were 38% and 41% identical, respectively, in amino acid sequence to 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase (encoded by pheC) from the phenol-utilizing B. thermoglucosidasius strain A7 (Duffner et al., 2000) (Figure 5).

All of the phenol hydroxylase genes upstream of the I.2.G EDO genes are very similar to one another, and their deduced products are 46% identical to PheA from B. stearothermophilus BR219, the only known single-component-type phenol hydroxylase (Kim and Oriel, 1995) (Figures 1 and 5). Fosmid 2C1 is different from the other 17 fosmids in that it additionally contains two putative genes for phenol hydroxylases. These genes (ORF2C1-33 and −32) are arranged in a tail-to-tail configuration, and their deduced products are 48 and 37% identical to PheA and PheB, respectively, from B. thermoglucosidasius A7 (Figures 1 and 5).

To examine the functions of these putative phenol hydroxylase genes, each DNA region containing the phenol hydroxylase and EDO genes was subcloned into pUC18. JM109 cells, separately carrying each of the 17 resulting plasmids, produced a yellow product on LB agar in the presence of catechol (Table 3), confirming catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activities. In addition, 12 of the 17 clones produced 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (yellow) on LB agar plates containing phenol. These active clones contain the genes for functional single-component phenol hydroxylases. Frame-shift (2C1, 4E12), nonsense (2A1), or substitution (2B9, 5B2) mutations in the remaining, inactive genes might have caused the loss or alteration of enzymatic activity (Table 3).

Fosmids carrying the I.2.G EDO genes were characterized by a relative abundance in mobile genetic elements and their remnants. It is also noteworthy that the transposase genes for ISPme1 (in 1D9 to 7B2; see below section ‘Reconstitution of a plasmid-like circular DNA from fosmid sequences carrying I.2.G EDO genes’) and an ISSop9-related element (ORF2B9-5, ORF2A1-27 and ORF2C1-24) were located very close to the single-component phenol hydroxylase genes (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S3). The fosmid 3G3 contains at least 10 genes predicted to be involved in the type IV conjugative transfer system: the gene for the coupling protein (TraG) and for the mating-pair formation apparatus (Trb) (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S3). The organization of these genes (trbBCDEJLFGI) in 3G3 resembles that found in the Tn4371 genomic island (Toussaint et al., 2003) rather than that found in self-transmissible plasmids (Schröder and Lanka, 2005). These genes exhibit ~60% identity to those of typical Tn4371-type genomic islands (Toussaint et al., 2003) and much higher (~90%) identities to those found on the second chromosome of the α-proteobacterial strain Ochrobactrum anthropi ATCC 49188. Therefore, the transfer-related gene cluster in 3G3 appears to be part of a variant Tn4371-type genomic island in which several α-proteobacterial genomes also reside.

The deduced gene products of ORF2A1-17, −16 and −15 share 96%, 89% and 44% identity, respectively, with the replication proteins RepA (ZP_01441940), RepB (ZP_01441941) and RepC (ZP_01038470) of Roseovarius sp. strains HTCC2601 (RepA and B) and 217 (RepC). This type of repABC operon controls stable replication and partitioning of large and low-copy-number plasmids and has been found only in α-Proteobacteria (Cevallos et al., 2008). Therefore, the 2A1 insert appears to originate from an α-proteobacterial plasmid, consistent with the result of SOM analysis.
Reconstitution of a plasmid-like circular DNA from fosmid sequences carrying I.2.G EDO genes

The fosmid fragments in 1D9, 1D2, 9B9, 3H5, 1H11 and 6D4 had overlapping sequences that were assembled into a 36 684-bp circular DNA form (Figure 6). This circular DNA, designated pSKYE1, contained a total of 34 ORFs and was considered to be a plasmid because of the observations described below.

The circular DNA pSKYE1 carries several genes related to plasmid replication (ORF1D9-5), partition (ORF1D9-12, and −29), and conjugation (ORF1D9-1, −14 and −31). The deduced gene product of ORF1D9-5 is 82% identical to RepA of plasmid pAMI2 of Paracoccus aminophilus JCM 7686, which has a replication system that is functional in several α-proteobacterial genera, such as Paracoccus, Rhizobium, Rhodobacter and Agrobacterium (Dziewit et al., 2007). Therefore, replication of pSKYE1 might be possible in α-proteobacterial strains. The repA gene of pAMI2 is followed by a so-called PAR module, which is responsible for the active partitioning function of the plasmid (Dziewit et al., 2007). Furthermore, pSKYE1 carries two putative partition gene modules (ORF1D9-12 and −13 and ORF1D2-29 and −30). The deduced gene products lack homology to the PAR modules in pAMI2. However, the deduced ORF1D9-12 and −13 gene products are 66% and 44% identical to the corresponding gene products encoded by Laribacter hongkongensis plasmid pHLHK22, and the deduced ORF1D2-29 and ORF1D9-30 gene products are 44% and 29% identical to the corresponding proteins encoded by a large plasmid from Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A. The deduced products of ORF1D9-1 and −14 are 70% and 87% identical to the C-terminal regions of the conjugative transfer TraG proteins of plasmid Ti from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (NP_059692) and plasmid pAgK84 from A. tumefaciens K84 (YP_086775), respectively, and the deduced ORF1D9-31 product is 51% identical to an intact conjugal transfer anti-restriction protein of Nitrobacter hamburgenis X14 (YP_575924).

An IS element and transposon were found in pSKYE1; their putative terminal inverted-repeat (IR) sequences are shown in Supplementary Figure S4. The former mobile genetic element flanked by 50-bp IR sequences is located very close to the single-component phenol hydroxylase gene and was thought to be ISPme1, an IS element from plasmid pMTH1 of Paracoccus methylutens DM12 (Bartosik et al., 2008). The latter element, designated Tn6032, has 25-bp IR sequences and carries three ORFs encoding polypeptides with moderate sequence identity to TniA (40%), TniB (35%) and an N-terminal portion of TniQ (23%) of Tn5053 from Xanthomonas sp. W17 (Kholodii et al., 1995). However, the IR sequences of Tn6032 are very different from those of Tn5053 and its related transposons, Tn402, Tn5468 and Tn7 (Oppon et al., 1998; Minakhina et al., 1999). Furthermore, the resolvase gene in Tn5053 was not found in Tn6032. The 3.8-kb region containing ORF28 and ORF29 shows 90% nucleotide sequence identity to the corresponding region of the 3.8-kb Tn3-family transposon ISTB11 on IncP-1α plasmid pTB11, which was exogenously isolated from a wastewater plant in Germany (Tennstedt et al., 2005). The nucleotide sequence of ISTB11 is distinct from that of other Tn3-family transposons, and its isoforms have not yet been discovered.

With respect to the genes involved in aromatic compound degradation, pSKYE1 contains only two genes for phenol hydroxylase and EDO. This situation is very different from that of known bacterial catabolic plasmids, which are usually large (>50 kb) and carry operonic degradative gene clusters (van der Meer et al., 1992; Dennis, 2005). Because of their great lipophilicity and their ability to produce reactive oxygen species, phenol and catechol are potentially toxic to bacterial cells (Benndorf et al., 2001). Wastewater from coke plants contains various organic pollutants, including phenol and mono- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Stamoudis and Luthy, 1980). Therefore, pSKYE1, which carries a ‘detoxification apparatus’ for aromatic compounds, is likely to provide a survival advantage to its host cells in this harsh environment. The same environment might host bacterial strains that cannot degrade aromatic compounds by themselves. These bacteria may be fortunate in having this ‘detoxification apparatus’ functioning in their environment.

Conclusions

In our previous study (Suenaga et al., 2007), we used a fosmid vector to clone environmental (that is, activated sludge) DNA fragments of 30–40 kb. These fragments were thought to be suitable for cloning large DNA fragments containing common aromatic compound degradation genes. In this study, we obtained various new insights into the distribution and organization of aromatics degradation genes in the activated sludge microbial community by analyzing the sequences of 38 selected clones. A major finding was that the complete pathways generally recognized as ‘standard’ in previous studies are extremely rare. Only two complete degradation pathways similar to dmp and tdn gene clusters were identified. Instead, various types of gene subsets were identified that were not similar to previously reported ‘upper’ or ‘lower’ pathway modules, suggesting that aromatic compounds in the sampled natural environment are degraded through the concerted actions of various fragmental pathways.

Strikingly, a small piece of the aromatics degradation pathway consisting of single-component type phenol hydroxylase and EDO was overrepresented. Taking into account the fact that this module is found on our plasmid-like circular DNA form pSKYE1, we conclude that pSKYE1 has a crucial role in the detoxification of aromatic compounds in our target environment. All of these findings were obtained from the analysis of nucleotides only 1.5 Mb in length. Thus, sequence analysis of metagenomes showing specific functions is extremely useful in uncovering novel findings concerning targeted biological functions and their evolutionary stages across a wide range of bacterial strains.
