Abstract
Metagenomics has been successfully applied to isolate novel biocatalysts from diverse environments and functional screening has been used as the primary technique to identify clones carrying the desired traits. This work aimed at the construction and screening of a metagenomic library as a source of potential hydrocarbon biodegraders. A library of 31000 clones was obtained from aerobic and anaerobic enrichments generated using a biodegraded petroleum sample collected at the Potiguar Basin in Brazil as an inoculum. A total of 5000 clones were randomly selected for high throughput screening of hexadecane biodegradation, revealing 72 positive hits. These were further evaluated using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS), outstanding hexadecane biodegradation ability (>70%) being detected in five clones.

1. Introduction
In the last few decades, the use of molecular biology methods has drastically changed our perspective on microbial diversity in nature, revealing that only a small fraction of microorganisms, from 0.001% to 15% depending on the complexity of the environment under study, can be recovered using cultivation techniques (Amann et al., 1995; Torsvik and vreås, 2002). In this context, although diverse bacteria capable of degrading petroleum hydrocarbons have been isolated and characterized, the vast majority of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, including anaerobes, probably remain undiscovered (Harayama et al., 2004).
The major motivation of all researchers who study biodegradation is undoubtedly the search for versatile microorganisms capable of efficiently degrading a wide variety of pollutants at low operational cost. It has been demonstrated, however, that some hydrocarbon-derived compounds are unusually recalcitrant, meaning that they are not metabolized by microorganisms or are transformed into metabolites that can accumulate in the environment or are as toxic as the parent compound (Esteve-Nunez et al., 2001). Furthermore, the degradation pathways of many pollutants remain unknown or are poorly characterized due to re-isolation of the same species when traditional cultivation methods are used to recover pollutant-degrading microorganisms.
The study and exploration of genomes of the “uncultured majority” has become possible through metagenomics, a culture-independent molecular biology-based method that allows one to explore the metabolic potential of uncultivated species by cloning large DNA fragments isolated directly from the environment (Galvão et al., 2005; Suenaga et al., 2007).
Considering that the biocatalytic potential of only 1–2% of the microorganisms in the world has been evaluated (Gomes and Steiner, 2004), metagenomic studies may offer a valuable tool for the exploration of untapped microbial diversity. Recent studies conducted by screening metagenomic libraries from diverse environmental samples have already shown the huge biocatalytic potential of diverse prokaryotes (Ferrer et al., 2005; Solbak et al., 2005).
The use of metagenomics to gain access to the poorly understood petroleum reservoir environment is innovative and may reveal new enzymes (biocatalysts) of interest for biotechnological processes such as bioremediation and microbial enhancement oil recovery (MEOR).

Consequently, the present study was aimed at the construction and screening of a metagenomic fosmid library from petroleum microbial enrichments to identify efficient hydrocarbon biodegraders.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sampling and geological settings
Oil samples were obtained in July 2008 from one production well at the onshore Potiguar Basin (Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil) with logistic support from CENPES/Petrobras. The sample, GMR75, used as an inoculum for the microbial enrichments, was classified as moderately biodegraded, with a biodegradation rank of 4–5 according to the Peters and Moldowan (1993) scale (Fig. 1). It was collected from a reservoir with an in situ temperature of 42.2 °C and at a depth of 535.5–540.5 m. The loss of hydrocarbons in natural reservoirs as a result of biodegradation is highly variable in the Potiguar Basin; however, a recent study suggested that the GMR oil has already lost more than 50% of its light hydrocarbons (Behar et al., 2006). The Potiguar Basin is located at the Brazilian equatorial margin, covering an area of about 119,295 km2, with 33,200 km2 (27.8%) classified as onshore and 86,095 km2 as offshore at a water depth up to 3000 m. The basin produces an average of 77,000 barrels of petroleum per day and constitutes the third largest Brazilian petroleum producer (Lopes et al., 1999 and references therein).

2.2. Microbial enrichments
Sample GMR75 was first homogenized in a water bath at 50 °C. For anaerobic enrichments, the cultures were grown in Schott bottles (1 l) containing 500 ml Widdel B mineral medium (Widdel et al., 2006) supplemented with n-hexadecane or a non-biodegraded oil sample, named P1, as carbon source. P1 oil was described previously as a non-biodegraded sample from the Campos Basin (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Vasconcellos et al., 2009). Prior to inoculation in Widdel B mineral medium, P1 was autoclaved (30 min at 121 °C and 1 atm) and the n-hexadecane was sterilized by filtration through a 0.22 μm membrane (Millipore). Milled and autoclaved shale (10 g) was added to the culture medium (250 ml in Schott bottles) as a physical support for the improvement of microbial growth, in an attempt to simulate the conditions in the petroleum reservoirs. Trace elements (Widdel et al., 2006) were also added to the medium and the whole system was purged by N2 flow and autoclaved for 20 min at 1 atm. Subsequently, the N2 atmosphere was exchanged for N2/CO2 (70:30) and Na2CO3 (5 m, 10%) and vitamin solution (5 ml) were added (Zinder et al., 1984). Finally, a cysteine–HCl solution (2 mM) was added (1%, v/v) as a final electron acceptor. Hexadecane or non-biodegraded oil (P1) was applied as a substrate (5 ml) for the recovery of microbiota in the biodegraded oil (GMR75) used as an inoculum (50 ml). The anaerobic enrichments were developed in four replicates, incubated at 55 °C for 120 days and monitored for cell density with turbidimetric analysis (MacFarland scale) and for sulfate reduction according to Kolmert et al. (2000). This standard turbidimetric method is based on the precipitation of sulfate ions in the medium with BaCl2, affording BaSO4.
Bushnell Haas (BH) mineral medium (Eriksson et al., 2000; Sette et al., 2007) was used for the aerobic enrichments. The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 and 200 ml aliquots were distributed into Schott bottles (1 l). Shale was added (10 g) and the bottles were autoclaved at 1 atm for 20 min. After sterilization, vitamin solution (Zinder et al., 1984) and 1 ml of hexadecane (0.5% v/v) were added to the medium, followed by inoculation with 10 ml of GMR75 oil (5% v/v) diluted in Tween 80 (1:1; Sette et al., 2007). The enrichments were developed in five replicates and incubated on an orbital shaker (100 rpm) for 30 days. Microbial growth was monitored for cell density via turbidimetric analysis (MacFarland scale).
2.3. DNA extraction
Community DNA was obtained from the aerobic and anaerobic microbial enrichments using the protocols described by Groβkopf et al. (1998) and Neria-Gonzáles et al. (2006) with modifications reported by Silva et al. (2010).
2.4. Diversity analysis
The bacterial diversity of the aerobic and anaerobic enrichments was evaluated using 16S rRNA gene libraries. PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes was performed from total community DNA by using the bacterial primer set 27f and 1100r (Lane, 1991). Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 50–100 ng of total DNA, 2 U Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen®), 1X Taq buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP mix (GE Healthcare) and 0.4 μM each primer. The PCR amplification was done using an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C and 3 min at 72 °C and a final extension step at 72 °C for 3 min using an Eppendorf thermal cycler. Two libraries were constructed, one for each enrichment. Amplified ribossomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and phylogenetic affiliations were performed as described by Sette et al. (2007). The 16S rDNA partial sequences determined were deposited at the GenBank database under the accession numbers HM059724 to HM059788.
2.5. Construction of metagenomic clone library
2.5.1. DNA preparation
DNA samples representing aerobic and anaerobic enrichments were pooled and submitted to electrophoresis (400 μl) in a low melting point agarose gel (1%) for size selection (35–45 kb). After pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (BIORAD CHEF DRII®) at 200 V (6 V cm−1) for 4 h at 14 °C, with an initial switch time of 5 s and a final switch time of 15 s, a strip from each side of the gel was cut off and stained to localize the DNA. A high molecular weight marker (Low Range PFG Marker, New England Biolabs®) (0.5 μl), a fosmid DNA control (Epicentre®) (1 μl) and an aliquot of the pooled DNA (4 μl) were used as references to select the region of interest. DNA-containing regions were cut from the rest of the gel (unstained), transferred to microtubes containing 0.5% TAE (tris–acetate–EDTA) and treated with gelase (1 U/μl of DNA).
2.5.2. Library construction
The fosmid clone library was constructed using the Cloning-Ready Copy Control pCC2FOS kit (Epicentre®) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. After the end-repair reaction of the insert ends, ca. 40 μg of the DNA mixture (aerobic and anaerobic) was ligated, packed and transfected into Escherichia coli EPI300 cells. Clones were replicated in 96-well microtiter plates with LB medium containing 20% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. For validation of the metagenomic library, six clones were randomly selected and grown under appropriate conditions, and fosmid DNA was extracted using a FosmidMax DNA Purification kit (Epicentre®) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The fosmids were digested with the enzyme NotI (Promega®), and their restriction profiles were checked on a 1% agarose gel using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (CHEF-DR II, BIORAD®) at 6 V cm−1 for 6 h, with a switch of 5–15.
2.6. Rapid screening for detection of microbial growth on hexadecane
The screening assays were developed according to methodology described by Johnsen et al. (2002) with some modifications. Hexadecane was chosen as a model compound to evaluate the ability of the fosmid clones to grow using it as sole carbon source. Clones were pre-cultured in microplates (96 wells) containing 150 μl LB broth added of chloramphenicol (12.5 μl/ml) and incubated at 37 °C on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) for 24 h. After growth, aliquots (15 μl) of the clone cultures were transferred to another microplate filled with 150 μl BH medium containing chloramphenicol (12.5 μg/ml) and hexadecane (1.5 μl), which was pre-sterilized by filtration through a 0.22 μM Millipore membrane. E. coli EPI 300 and Micrococcus sp. (CBMAI 636; Vasconcellos et al., 2009) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. After 48 h incubation at 37 °C on a rotary shaker (150 rpm), 30 μl MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2 H-tetrazolium bromide] (Merck®) solution (1 mg/ml) was added to each well to evaluate microbial respiration and consequent hexadecane consumption. The microplates were incubated again at 37 °C for 1 h. The generation of a purple color was considered to be a positive hit, while a yellow color was indicative of the absence of cellular activity (Bicalho et al., 2003).
2.7. GC–MS analysis of hexadecane biodegradation
Clones with positive growth using hexadecane as sole carbon source were evaluated for their biodegradation ability using chromatographic analysis. Clones were pre-cultured in pools (nine clones per pool), and 1 ml aliquots were inoculated in Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500 ml of LB added of chloramphenicol (12.5 μl/ml), followed by incubation on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 37 °C for 24 h. The cells were centrifuged (5000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C) and the pellet was washed twice with distilled water. The pools were suspended in ultrapure water at 108 CFU/m. Erlenmeyer flasks (125 ml) containing 40 ml BH mineral medium with chloramphenicol (12.5 μl/ml) were inoculated with 400 μl hexadecane, 40 μl vitamin solution (Zinder et al., 1984) and 4 ml of the cellular suspension (each pool of nine clones). The assays were run with five replicates and monitored for 28 days using GC–MS. Doubly distilled hexane was used as extraction solvent for the organic phase in the chromatographic analysis. Phenanthrene solution (0.5 mg/ml) was applied as internal standard. GC–MS conditions are described by Vasconcellos et al. (2009). The clones in pools showing significant hydrocarbon degradation were evaluated individually using the same protocols as described above.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Microbial enrichments
Slices of shale were used in the microbial enrichments in an attempt to simulate the physical conditions existing in petroleum reservoirs and improve the growth of the microorganisms in the petroleum samples. The technique of microbial cell immobilization is widely used to increase biomass in anaerobic reactors (Silva et al., 2006), although the choice of an ideal support is a limiting factor in the selection of microbial populations. In this study, the microbial enrichments were developed using hexadecane or a non-biodegraded petroleum sample (P1) as carbon source, with the goal of recovering microorganisms that might be involved in hydrocarbon biodegradation. Shale was not chosen randomly as a support for microbial growth and increased DNA recovery. Previous enrichment assays using different matrices have shown that the use of shale afforded the highest level of DNA recovery (data not shown). After 120 days monitoring, intense biomass generation was observed. with a cellular density higher >108 CFU/ml for both substrates (hexadecane and P1). The same microbial enrichments showed up to 69% sulfate reduction, suggesting the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria in both enrichments.
3.2. DNA extraction
Total DNA extraction was successful for both aerobic and anaerobic enrichments, affording high molecular weight DNA (up to 40 kb) at ⩾50 ng/μl for the aerobic enrichment and ⩾100 ng/μl for the anaerobic enrichment (Fig. 2).

The use of hexadecane as a substrate in the anaerobic enrichment was more efficient for the recovery of hydrocarbon-biodegrading bacteria than the enrichment using P1 oil and resulted in a larger amount of DNA recovered (Fig. 2). In contrast, no difference in DNA yield was observed in the aerobic enrichment using hexadecane or P1 oil. DNA samples obtained using both carbon sources were pooled and used for diversity analysis. For the construction of the metagenomic library, DNA samples from both the aerobic and anaerobic enrichments were pooled and treated as a single sample.
3.3. Diversity analysis
The bacterial diversity of the aerobic (AER) and anaerobic (ANA) enrichments was evaluated by analysis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. A total of 96 clones from the AER library and 91 from the ANA library were screened by ARDRA to select different ribotypes for subsequent sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Combined data from ARDRA and sequencing revealed that the bacterial members represented in the 16S rDNA library from the aerobic enrichment were affiliated (78%) with the genera Petrobacter (Phylum Proteobacteria, Class Betaproteobacteria) and (22%) Micromonospora/Verrucosispora (Phylum Actinobacteria) (Table 1, Fig. 3).

Evolutionary distances were based on the Kimura 2p model and tree reconstruction on the neighbor-joining method. Bootstrap values (1000 replicate runs, shown as %) > 70% are listed. GenBank accession numbers are listed after species names. Numbers in brackets after clone name indicate additional sequences showing ≥ 97% similarity with the clone represented in the tree. Methanohalophilus portucalensis was used as outgroup.
The anaerobic microbiota represented in the 16S rDNA library from the biodegraded petroleum sample were more diverse, and the bacterial members were related to the genera Flexistipes (24%) (Phylum Deferribacteres), Thermodesulfovibrio (20%) (Phylum Nitrospirae), Petrotoga (15.4%) (Phylum Thermotogae), Anaerobaculum (2.2%) (Phylum Synergistetes) and Rahnella (38.4%) (Phylum Proteobacteria, Class Gammaproteobacteria) (Table 1, Fig. 3).
Most of bacterial genera found in the aerobic and anaerobic enrichments had been described in the literature as inhabitants of petroleum-associated environments (Nazina et al., 2006; Miranda-Tello et al., 2007). A bacterium of the genus Petrobacter, the most abundant in the aerobic enrichment (Table 1; Fig. 3), was recently isolated from a non-water flooded Australian terrestrial oil reservoir and described as a novel nitrate-reducing bacterium and moderately thermophilic (Salinas et al., 2004). The reservoir characteristics described by Salinas and collaborators (2004) are actually very similar to those of the reservoir sampled in this study. The genera Micromonospora and Verrucosispora, also recovered from the aerobic enrichment, belong to the Order Actinomycetales and are phylogenetically closely related (Rheims et al., 1998). Ara and Kudo (2007) described Micromonospora spp. as being widely distributed in marine environments, sediments, soils and extreme sites such as Antarctica. These bacteria were also described as being capable of using hydrocarbons as sole carbon source (Vidal et al., 1999), corroborating the findings of the present work.
Flexistipes and Petrotoga-related clones recovered in the anaerobic enrichments (Table 1; Fig. 3) have also been reported as commonly occurring groups in petroleum reservoirs. Flexistipes is a metal-reducing microorganism that reduces a variety of metals in metabolic processes coupled to the oxidation of organic compounds in petroleum accumulations (Yacob, 2000). The genus Petrotoga, together with the genera Geotoga and Thermotoga, belong to the order Thermotogales and are described as thermophilic microorganisms occurring exclusively in petroleum reservoirs (Miranda-Tello et al., 2007). Thermodesulfovibrio spp. were described by Nazina and co-workers (2006) as an indigenous sulfate reducing group in the microbiota of the Dagang Oilfield (China). In this sense, the recovery of these bacteria in the anaerobic enrichment may suggest that they are native members of the microbial community in the Potiguar Basin reservoirs. The genus Anaerobaculum was first isolated from a petroleum reservoir and characterized as being comprised of Gram-negative, anaerobic, thermophilic, fermentative bacteria involved in organic acid degradation processes (Rees et al., 1997). The data are consistent with the recovery of Anaerobaculum spp. in the anaerobic enrichment cultivated under thermophilic conditions and inoculated with crude oil derived from the Potiguar Basin reservoirs, which are known for their high organic acid content (Lopes et al., 1999). Finally, community analysis also showed the recovery of Rahnella-related species in the anaerobic enrichment. Although not commonly described in petroleum environments, these bacteria are reported as being involved in hydrocarbon biodegradation in Antarctic soil contaminated with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; Ma et al., 2006).
3.4. Construction and screening of metagenomic clone library
A fosmid metagenomic library was constructed using a mixture of the total DNA recovered from the aerobic and anaerobic enrichments, affording 31000 clones representing the bacterial diversity present in a biodegraded petroleum sample (GMR75, Potiguar Basin). Validation of this clone library by the digestion of six randomly selected clones using the restriction enzyme Not I revealed different band profiles, confirming the presence of different insertion events and the potential for the fosmid library to be representative of the bacterial diversity found in the enrichments.

Based on strategies in the literature, a rapid colorimetric screening test was established for the detection of bacterial growth in hexadecane as sole carbon source (Johnsen et al., 2002; Bicalho et al., 2003). In this sense, 5000 clones were randomly chosen and screened using high throughput assays. Results revealed 72 positive hits detected by way of the development of a violet color resulting from the oxidation of MTT (Bicalho et al., 2003). The potential of these clones to use hexadecane as a sole carbon source was considered to be indicative of their degradation ability.
3.5. GC–MS analysis for detection of hexadecane biodegradation
The biodegradation activity of the 72 clones considered to be positive hits from the high throughput screening was evaluated using GC–MS. These clones were first investigated in pools, and hexadecane was again used as the model compound. It is present in the aliphatic fraction of crude oil and is one of the major components of diesel (Chénier et al., 2003). As an n-alkane, it has been used as a model compound to study aliphatic hydrocarbon biodegradation by many authors (Berthe-Corti and Fetzner, 2002; Schoefs et al., 2004; Widdel et al., 2006).
Among the eight pools evaluated (nine clones per pool), only one (CO8) showed biodegradation levels >50%. Three other pools did not show any biodegradation ability and the remaining four pools showed hexadecane biodegradation levels up to 28%. The CO8 pool was selected for biodegradation assays using GC–MS, and the clones were evaluated individually. GC–MS showed that five of the nine clones were able to degrade hexadecane by >70% after 21 days monitoring (Table 2; Fig. 4). It is important to note that the results refer to clones, which constitute a heterologous expression system in E. coli cells. In this sense, the extent of biodegradation observed can be considered excellent when compared to data in the literature on the biodegradation abilities of bacterial strains. Whyte et al. (1998) reported a Rhodococcus strain that showed a hexadecane biodegradation level of 6.1% after 102 days incubation. In another study, Ripley et al. (2000) developed systems for the immobilization of Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter cells and observed hexadecane biodegradation levels between 33% and 51%. An evaluation of the hexadecane biodegradation and emulsification abilities of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain under different experimental conditions revealed a biodegradation level of 11% after 3 days monitoring (Noordman et al., 2002). Furthermore, Vasconcellos et al. (2009) recently evaluated the biodegradation of different classes of petroleum biomarkers using aerobic strains isolated from the Campos Basin reservoir and found biodegradation levels <70% when only hydrocarbons were added as a carbon source. All these data confirm the significant results obtained in the present work using fosmid clones bearing catabolic genes from a petroleum reservoir, which were shown to successfully express hexadecane biodegradation ability in E. coli host cells.

Investigation of the biodegradation ability of the five clones is being extended and other biomarkers (e.g. phenanthrene, naphthalene, dodecane and tetradecane), complex mixtures of hydrocarbons and crude petroleum are being tested as substrates. Additionally, sub-cloning assays are being conducted to identify which catabolic pathways responsible for hydrocarbon degradation are present in the petroleum reservoirs of the Potiguar Basin.

4. Conclusions
This is the first report of the construction of a metagenomic clone library from a Brazilian petroleum reservoir sample. The clones that showed excellent hexadecane biodegradation ability (>70%) are undergoing genomic and proteomic investigations to unravel the biodegradation routes that occur in petroleum-associated environments. The results of the present work demonstrate the potential of a metagenomic approach for prospecting the microbial diversity in hostile environments such as petroleum reservoirs in the search for biocatalysts for use in biotechnological and industrial processes.
