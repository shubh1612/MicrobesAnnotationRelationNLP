Running title: Biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons

SUMMARY
Microbial enumeration and identification were carried out on several oil contaminated
soil samples collected from gasoline and diesel stations. Bacteria were the most dominant
microbiota and were therefore classified to generic level. Eleven main genera were
detected and Corynebacterium was the predominant genus in all the samples.
Biochemical characterisation and substrate utilisation showed high percentage of lipolytic
ability combined with high inorganic nitrogen utilisers. The ability of these cultures to
degrade crude oil was tested individually and in mixed bacterial consortium at different
temperatures and pH values. Maximum crude oil biodegradation of 78% was achieved
using a bacterial consortium containing five cultures (Micrococcus sp. GS2-22,
Corynebacterium sp. GS5-66, Flavobacterium sp. DS5-73, Bacillus sp. DS6-86 and
Pseudomonas sp. DS10-129) with 1% crude oil at 30oC and pH 7.5. Such a consortium
may be useful for bioaugmentation of oil contaminated environments.

INTRODUCTION
Petroleum continues to serve as the principle source of energy. Wide scale production,
transport, use and disposal of petroleum globally has made it a lead contaminant in both
prevalence and quantity in the environment. As a result of the increase in automobiles, the
number of gasoline/diesel stations and automobile service stations is ever increasing. In
gasoline, diesel stations and service stations, oil is spilled during transfer and servicing
operations. During accidental spills, action will be taken to remove or remediate or recover
the contaminant immediately, whereas in the gasoline and diesel stations the spills due to
leakage may be small but continuous and prolonged. Because of its persistence, the chance
for groundwater contamination is greater.
The addition of hydrocarbons to an ecosystem may result in a selective increase in
microorganisms capable of utilising the hydrocarbons and those that are capable of
utilising metabolites produced by the hydrocarbon-utilisers (Venkateswaran et al. 1995;
Ferrari et al. 1996). The enhancement or reduction will depend upon the chemical
composition of the contaminating hydrocarbons and on the species of microorganisms
present within the microbial community of the particular ecosystem (Atlas 1995).
The Gulf War and an increasing trend in tanker accidents have focussed attention on the
problem of hydrocarbon contamination in the environment. The traditional methods to cope
with oil spills are mainly through physical containment and collection using floating
booms, applications of adsorbents such as straw, shredded polyurethane or porous volcanic
glasses and/or dispersal by detergents (Ollis 1992). Biological methods have an edge over
the physico-chemical treatment regimes in removing spills as they offer in situ biodegradation of oil fractions by the microorganisms (Ferrari et al.1996)

The fate of petroleum hydrocarbons in the environment, including biodegradation, is
largely determined by abiotic factors, which influence the extent of weathering. This paper
describes the microbial population and microbial diversity of samples from gasoline and
diesel stations and explores the possibility of using selected bacterial cultures and bacterial
consortium to degrade Bombay high crude oil at various environmental conditions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Screening of samples
The soil samples (100g each) were collected from ten Gasoline spilled (GS) and diesel
spilled (DS) stations for the isolation of oil degrading microorganisms. The samples were
collected in pre-sterilised glass bottles and transported to the laboratory for analysis.
Enumeration and isolation of heterotrophic bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi was carried
out through serial dilution-agar plating technique using Nutrient agar, Kuster’s agar and
Rose Bengal agar medium (HIMEDIA) respectively.

Characterisation of bacteria
The isolates were grouped to various genera as per Bergey's Manual of Determinative
Bacteriology (Holt et al., 1994). These cultures were characterised depending on their
morphology, gram staining, spore staining, motility, oxidase, catalase, oxidation
fermentation, gas production, ammonia formation, nitrate and nitrite reduction, indole
production test, methyl-red and Voges-Proskauer test, citrate and mannitol utilisation test,
hydrolysis of casein, gelatin, starch, urea and lipid (Aaranson 1970).

Growth of bacteria on crude oil
The bacterial cultures isolated from oil spilled environment were inoculated in Mineral
salts medium (Kennedy et al., 1975) with 1% Bombay High crude oil as carbon source. It
was kept in the shaker at 200 rpm at 30°C for a period of seven days. The growth was
recorded and categorized spectrophotometrically as low growth with optical density (OD)
in the range 0.21-0.4, moderate growth (OD 0.41-0.6), high growth (OD 0.61-0.8) and
excellent growth (OD 0.81-1.0) all measured at 620nm.

Preparation of inoculum
The bacterial isolates that exhibited excellent growth on crude oil, Micrococcus sp. GS222, Bacillus sp. DS6-86, Corynebacterium sp. GS5-66, Flavobacterium sp. DS5-73 and
Pseudomonas sp. DS10-129, were selected. A loopful of culture was inoculated into 100ml
sterile nutrient broth. The flasks were incubated and shaken at 200 rpm, for 12h at 30°C.
One ml volumes of the culture broth from each of the above five isolates were mixed to
prepare mixed bacterial consortium.

Degradation of crude oil
Individual bacterial cultures and bacterial consortium (1.0 %) were transferred to 250 ml
conical flasks, each containing 100 ml of sterile defined mineral salts medium with 1%
Bombay High (BH) crude oil. An uninoculated control was also studied concurrently. The
flasks were incubated at 30°C and shaken at 200 rpm for 20 days. At 2-day intervals, a set of
flasks was used for the enumeration of microbial population and estimation of crude oil content

5

spectrophotometrically as described in Rahman et al. (2002). Degradation was estimated as
difference between the initial and final concentration of the oil content in the medium.
Effect of environmental factors on the growth and degradation of BH crude oil
The effect of pH (6.5, 7.5 and 8.5), temperature (15°C, 20°C and 30°C) on the bacterial
growth and degradation of 1% crude oil were studied by using mineral salts medium with
BH crude oil.

RESULTS
Microbiology of oil spilled samples
The highest microbial population was observed for the sample GS-5. The bacterial, fungal
and actinomycetes populations were recorded as 3.0 x 106 CFU g-1, 8.9 x 104 and 4.3 x 104
CFU g-1 respectively (Table 1). In gasoline station soil, the maximum (2.98 mg g-1) and
minimum (0.56 mg g-1) oil contents were recorded for samples GS-5 and GS-7. The
bacterial count in diesel station soil samples ranged between 3.0 x 105 CFU g-1 for sample
DS-1 and 2.1 x 108 CFU g-1 for sample DS-9. Among the diesel station soil samples the
maximum fungal and actinomycetes populations were observed for sample DS-9 with 7.0 x
104 CFU g-1 and 4.7 x 104 CFU g-1 respectively. In diesel station soil, the maximum of 5.21
mg g-1 oil content was noticed in sample DS-9 and minimum of 1.65 mg g-1 in sample
DS-7.

Among the four pH (6.5, 7.5 and 8.5) tested, pH 7.5 was found optimum for all the
bacterial isolates and bacterial consortium (data not shown). Hence the pH 7.5 was selected
for further experiments. All the five individual isolates and bacterial consortium showed
maximum activity and crude oil degradation at 30°C and population also correspondingly
increased (Fig. 4). Bacterial consortium showed maximum (78%) degradation and reached
a population size of about 9 x 108 CFU ml-1 while using 1% BH crude oil as substrate.

DISCUSSION
Bacteria, actinomycetes and fungal populations were high in samples GS-5 and DS-9,
where higher quantities of oil contents were noticed. Similarly large population of bacteria,
actinomycetes and fungi were recorded from oil-spilled environment (Venkateswaran et al.
1993; Wrenn and Venosa 1996; Cabello 1997). Population levels of hydrocarbon utilisers
and their population within the microbial community appear to be a sensitive index of
environmental exposure to hydrocarbons. In unpolluted ecosystem, hydrocarbon utilisers
generally constitute less than 0.1% of the microbial community and in oil polluted
ecosystems they can constitute upto 100% of the viable microorganisms. The microbial
populations quantitatively reflect the degree or extent of exposure of that ecosystem to
hydrocarbon contamination (Atlas 1981; Al-gounaim et al. 1995).
In general, gasoline and diesel station soil samples contained Corynebacterium species
at higher proportion. The dominance of the genus Corynebacterium revealed that it might
have developed the ability to acclimatize to the oil environment. We observed bacteria
belonged to diversified groups, which may be due to the oil enrichment. The changes in the
dynamic equilibrium state of soil or aquatic environment leads to a corresponding change
in microbial population and composition. The added oil enriched for the species that have
inherent petroleum hydrocarbon assimilating potential (Bossert and Bartha 1984),
whereas the less adapted species among the total heterotrophic population are gradually
eliminated, resulting in qualitative shifts in species composition (Amadi 1990).
The biochemical characteristics of the bacteria varied. Austin et al. (1977) reported that the
biochemical reactions of the petroleum degraders, as a whole, were not uniform and no
pattern of relatedness were discernible based on the reactions. In oil-spilled soil, lipolytic

13

forms were present in high numbers, which may be due to richness of lipid source available
in the area. Walker et al. (1975) also found an increase in absolute numbers of proteolytic
bacteria, as well as lipolytic, chitinolytic and cellulolytic bacteria in oil contaminated subestuary of Chesapeake Bay.
Microorganisms are known to attack specific compounds present in crude oil that is a
complex mixture of saturates, aromatics and polar compounds (Bharathi and Vasudevan
2001). An effective degradation of crude oil would require simultaneous action of several
metabolically versatile microorganisms with faourable environmental conditions such as pH,
temperature and availability of nutrients (Venkateswaran and Harayama 1995). An oil spill in
the environment leads to an adaptive process and if metabolically active hydrocarbon
utilising microorganisms could be added quickly, the long period before the indigenous
population could respond would be reduced considerably. The necessity for seeding with
complementary hydrocarbon degrading bacteria arises from the rationale that indigenous
microbial populations may not be capable of degrading a wide range of potential substrates
in a complex mixture such as crude oil (Chhatre et al. 1996).
It seems that a natural microbial community includes a variety of microorganisms that can
degrade, alone or together, most crude oil components, but that some of their degrading ability
would not be expressed in a single batch culture owing to unfavorable physiological conditions
(Venkateswaran et al., 1995). When mixed cultures are grown in crude oil medium, some
organic acids, which prevent the growth of the bacteria, are formed. However, in a mixed
culture system, the growth of the organism cannot be regulated because of nutrient stress and
competition. The ability of the designed bacterial consortium and individual bacteria with wide
crude oil degrading capacity has been employed for the degradation of crude oil.

14

The isolated crude oil degraders belong to the genera Micrococcus, Corynebacterium,
Bacillus,

Enterobacter,

Pseudomonas,

Alcaligenes,

Flavobacterium,

Moraxella,

Aeromonas, Acinetobacter and Vibrio. The flora reflects the normal heterotrophic bacteria
present in soil and native genera seem to be crude oil utilisers. Several other workers also
reported on the above genera as hydrocarbon degrading microorganisms (Atlas 1981;
Leahy and Colwell 1990; Banat et al. 2000).
In general, bacterial consortium showed maximum percentage (78%) of degradation of
crude oil after 20 days of incubation. Chhatre et al. (1996) reported about 60% of
degradation of crude oil using a semicontinuous crude oil fed reactor using a four
member consortium. Several other workers (Venkateswaran and Harayama 1995; Lal and
Khanna 1996; Sugiura et al. 1997) showed that a bacterial consortium was able to
degrade 28-51% of saturates and 0-18% of aromatics present in crude oil or up to 60%
crude oil by mixed consortia. The percentage of biodegradation was significantly higher
than that achieved by individual isolates. Among the four different pH tested, the
bacterial growth and percentage degradation of crude oil were maximum at pH 7.5. Most
of the heterotrophic bacteria favor a pH near neutrality (Atlas 1981). Temperature
influences petroleum biodegradation by its effect on the physical nature and chemical
composition of the oil, rate of hydrocarbon metabolism by microorganisms, and composition of the microbial community (Atlas 1981). Our studies showed maximum
biodegradation activity at 30°C.
Our research work clearly shows that oil contaminated soil can be a principle source for
potent oil degrading bacteria. Genus Corynebacterium was dominant in all the samples

15

analyzed. It was observed that bacterial consortium degraded Bombay high crude oil
efficiently when compared to the individual bacterial cultures tested.
