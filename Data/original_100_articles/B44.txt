Approximately 300 gasoline-degrading bacteria were isolated from well water and core material from a
shallow coastal aquifer contaminated with unleaded gasoline. Identification of 244 isolates revealed four
genera: Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes, Nocardia, and Micrococcus, with pseudomonads making up 86.9% of
bacteria identified. A total of 297 isolates was sorted into 111 catabolic groups on the basis of aerobic growth
responses on 15 gasoline hydrocarbons. Each test hydrocarbon was degraded by at least one isolate. Toluene,
p-xylene, ethylbenzene, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene were most frequently utilized as growth substrates,
whereas cyclic and branched alkanes were least utilized. Most isolates were able to grow on 2 or 3 different
hydrocarbons, and nearly 75% utilized toluene as a sole source of carbon and energy. Isolates were remarkably
specific for hydrocarbon usage, often catabolizing only one of several closely related compounds. A subset of
220 isolates was sorted into 51 groups by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was
partitioned into 16 protein-banding groups (i.e., subspecies) whose catabolic activities were largely restricted
to substituted aromatics. Different members of subspecies groups defined by protein-banding pattern analysis
often exhibited different growth responses on the same hydrocarbon, implying marked strain diversity. The
catabolic activities of well-derived, gasoline-degrading bacteria associated with this contaminated aquifer are
consonant with in situ adaptation at the site.
Gasoline is a complex mixture of refined petroleum hydrocarbons
comprising more than 200 different compounds and
stereoisomeric forms differing in their volatilities, solubilities,
sorptive characteristics, and subsurface transport properties
(2, 24). Some aromatic constituents of gasoline (e.g.,
benzene) are recognized human carcinogens whose maximum
permissible concentrations in potable water supplies
are federally regulated (9). Thus, gasoline hydrocarbons
originating from underground leaks or surface spills pose a
demonstrable threat to the public health and quality of
potable groundwater resources. The low solubility of many
gasoline constituents coupled with a tendency for hydrocarbons
to strongly sorb to aquifer materials enhances the
persistence of gasoline constituents in subsurface environments,
especially if biotic processes are suppressed (2, 5, 7,
18).
Many gasoline hydrocarbons have been demonstrated to
be directly biodegraded (1, 2, 4-6, 13, 22, 26) or cometabolized
(2, 16, 17, 23) by native groundwater microflora given
appropriate inorganic nutrient supplementation. Despite exploitation
of gasoline-degrading microorganisms for purposes
of in situ aquifer bioremediation (2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 16,
17, 27-30), there is still very little known about the ecology,
taxonomy, and catabolic diversity of gasoline-degrading
bacteria associated with areas of subterranean contamination
(1-3, 6, 12, 13). Introduction of gasoline hydrocarbons
into a previously uncontaminated subsurface environment
could be expected to perturb local selective conditions,
thereby inducing adaptive responses in the size, structure,
physiology, and genetics of indigenous microbial communities
(13). The magnitude of and time required for such
adaptive changes are, at best, poorly understood. Information

bial assemblages involved in gasoline hydrocarbon catabolism
is critical for accurately evaluating and modeling in situ
degradation rates and potentials (5, 7, 18).
A primary objective of the present investigation was to
explore and quantify the taxonomic and physiologic diversity
of an aerobic, gasoline-degrading bacterial community
associated with a shallow coastal aquifer contaminated with
unleaded gasoline. In order to accomplish this goal, gasolinedegrading
bacteria isolated from observation well groundwater
and aquifer cores from this study site were differentiated
by three independent methods: (i) determination of growth
responses on 15 different hydrocarbon substrates representing
the major hydrocarbon categories found in unleaded
gasoline, (ii) computer-programmed sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of cellular
proteins followed by dendrogram analysis, and (iii) identification
of isolates by conventional biochemical and nutritional
testing. Results obtained by these methods were
compared with one another to determine the taxonomic and
catabolic diversity of the sample population as well as the
potential for microbially mediated degradation of different
hydrocarbon contaminants at the site.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Description of study site and sampling wells. The study site
consisted of a shallow coastal aquifer underlying the U.S.
Naval Weapons Station in Seal Beach, Calif. The aquifer
was composed primarily of silty and sandy alluvial deposits
and was contaminated with 20,000 to 40,000 liters of unleaded
gasoline from an underground tank (R. Schroeder,
U.S. Geological Survey, San Diego, Calif., personal communication).
Approximately 30 polyvinylchloride-encased
observation wells perforated the aquifer to a maximum depth
of about 20 feet (ca. 6 m). The wells were placed in 1984 and
1985 by the U.S. Geological Survey to delineate the nature
and extent of hydrocarbon contamination and plume migra-

tion (R. Schroeder, personal communication). Wells were
bored without drilling fluids by using 5- to 15.2-cm-diameter
hollow-stemmed augers; aseptic precautions were not taken
to prevent contamination of the aquifer with surface microorganisms.
Therefore, gasoline-degrading isolates obtained
from groundwater samples in the present study were regarded
as well-derived bacteria and not necessarily as true
aquifer bacteria. Site characterization studies indicated that
the groundwater is brackish (from seawater intrusion) and
contains numerous gasoline hydrocarbons (unpublished
data). Substituted aromatic hydrocarbons predominated at
this site and were most concentrated in well 2 (Fig. 1) located
approximately 10 m up-gradient from the spill origin. Concentrations
of individual hydrocarbons typically ranged from
10 to 100 mg/liter in groundwater obtained from well 2 to less
than 1.0 ,ug/liter in wells located along the periphery of the
plume (e.g., well 7; unpublished data).
Origins of isolates used in study. Origins of the 309 gasoline-degrading
bacteria used in this study are listed in Table
1. A total of 220 isolates were directly subcultured from
groundwater samples (as described below) from the eight
observation wells (Fig. 1). An additional 30 isolates were
subcultured from an enrichment culture inoculated with
groundwater from well 30, and 59 isolates were recovered by
direct subculture from aquifer core material obtained near
well 30 (see below). As noted above, the gasoline-degrading
isolates were regarded as well-derived rather than native
aquifer bacteria, since aseptic drilling practices were not
employed when observation wells were placed in 1984 and
1985.
Core sampling. A total of 59 gasoline-degrading isolates
were obtained from an aquifer core sample obtained on 30
July 1987 (Table 1). The core was recovered from a depth of
approximately 2.75 m at a location about 2 m northeast of
well 30. Coring was performed by using a 76.2-cm-diameter
bucket auger which was disinfected with a pressurized steam

jet before and at intervals during drilling and also immediately
prior to retrieval of the final core sample. The final core
sample was extracted from the borehole, positioned above a
sterile plastic container (diameter, 30 cm; 20-liter capacity),
and abruptly released, completely plugging the container
within about 0.1 s. The outermost 10 cm of the core was
sheared away as the container was plugged. The container
was sealed aseptically and transported to the laboratory for
analysis.
Collection of groundwater samples. Groundwater samples
were obtained from observation wells by use of a manual
bellows pump. The pump intake was connected by sterile
tubing to a 1.27-cm-diameter polyvinylchloride sampling
tube permanently installed in each observation well (to
prevent cross-contamination of wells). A minimum of five
residual well volumes of groundwater (30 to 40 liters) was
pumped out of the well as a flush prior to sample collection.
After flushing, a sterile 1-liter vacuum flask was placed
between the polyvinylchloride sample tube and pump assembly
by using sterile Tygon tubing and interconnectors. A
1-liter sample of groundwater was drawn into the flask, and
this was dispensed aseptically into sterile plastic bottles
(Nalgene). The samples were stored on ice and transported
to the laboratory within 3 h of collection.
Isolation of gasoline-degrading bacteria. Gasoline-degrading
bacteria (aerobic and facultative) were isolated by diluting
groundwater samples in sterile hydrocarbon minimal
medium (HCMM2) and spread-plating 0. 1-ml aliquots onto
HCMM2 agar plates. HCMM2 medium contained (per liter
of distilled water) the following: 1.36 g of KH2PO4; 1.42 g of
Na2HPO4; 0.5 g of KNO3; 2.38 g of (NH4)2SO4; 0.05 g of
MgSO4 7H2O; 0.01 g of CaCI2; 2.86 mg of H3BO4; 1.54 mg
of MnSO4. H20; 3.53 mg of Fe (NH4)2(SO4)2 6H2O; 0.039
mg of CuSO4 5H2O; 0.021 mg of ZnCl2; 0.041 mg of
CoCl2 6H20; and 0.025 mg of Na2MoO4 2H2O. The medium
was adjusted to pH 7.2 with 1 N NaOH. Use of 0.8%
(wt/vol) purified agar (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems,
Cockeysville, Md.) to prepare HCMM2 plates was
essential in obtaining low background colony counts. Plates
were prepared in duplicate, maintained at room temperature
(about 23°C) in sealed plastic containers (Rubbermaid, Inc.,
Wooster, Ohio) for 2 weeks, and examined at intervals for
colony formation. Hydrocarbon vapors for growth were
supplied by an open vial of unleaded gasoline placed in the
plastic containers; HCMM2 plates incubated in this manner
are hereafter referred to as HCMM2-gasoline. Duplicate

control plates were initially incubated without gasoline in
sealed plastic containers with a 1-cm layer of granularactivated
carbon to adsorb trace organics in the container
atmosphere. The use of granular-activated carbon was eventually
abandoned when it was found to be ineffective at
reducing background counts. Colony counts on control
plates were typically less than 0.1 CFU/ml.
To isolate bacteria from aquifer core materials, 5.0 g of
material was aseptically added to 100 ml of sterile HCMM2
broth amended with 0.1% (wt/vol) sodium pyrophosphate (3,
12). The resulting slurry was homogenized for approximately
30 s at high speed in a Waring blender equipped with a
sterile, stainless steel microblender head. Aliquots were
removed from the supernatant phase of the homogenized
suspension for bacterial isolation on HCMM2-gasoline, as
described above.
Some gasoline-degrading bacteria used in this study were
obtained from an enrichment culture which had been inoculated
with groundwater from well 30 (Table 1). The enrichment
culture was prepared in a 100-ml sterile septum vial
containing 50 ml of sterile HCMM2 broth supplemented with
0.1% (vol/vol) unleaded gasoline. Following inoculation with
5.0 ml of groundwater from well 30, the vial was sealed and
incubated with shaking at ambient temperature (about 230C).
After 1 week, the vial was unsealed and gasoline-degrading
bacteria were isolated as described above.
Catabolic screening of gasoline-degrading isolates. Gasoline-degrading
bacteria were subcultured from initial isolation
plates to fresh HCMM2-gasoline plates, twice checked
for purity by restreaking on the same medium, and stored
frozen on sterile Whatman filter disks at -120°C. Isolates
were screened (in duplicate) for growth on each of 15
common gasoline hydrocarbons (Table 2). All test hydrocarbons
were anhydrous and of spectrophotometric grade and
were rated at >99.0%, with the exception of o-xylene and
methylcyclopentane, which were rated at >97.0% and
>98.0%, respectively. A Varian model 3400 gas chromatograph
(GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID;
Varian, Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif.) and a 30-m DB624 megabore
column (J. W. Scientific, Folsom, Calif.) was used to confirm
reported purities of and identify contaminants in toluene,
ethylbenzene, methylcyclopentane, and o-xylene (Table 2).
Unstable or hygroscopic hydrocarbons (e.g., octane, ethylbenzene,
o-xylene, and p-xylene) were stored under nitrogen
for the duration of the study.
Isolates were toothpicked from stock cultures (grown on
HCMM2-gasoline) onto fresh HCMM2 agar and exposed to
single-hydrocarbon vapors in sealed chambers (e.g.,
HCMM2-benzene). Chambers consisted of 4-liter widemouthed
glass jars fitted with Teflon-lined screw-cap lids.
Each jar contained a hydrocarbon vapor generator consisting
of a standard 20-ml glass liquid scintillation vial filled
with cotton soaked in the appropriate hydrocarbon and
capped with a Teflon-lined septum. The septum was pierced
with a 22-gauge hypodermic needle to provide a gradual
release of hydrocarbon vapor to the chamber atmosphere.
Gas chromatographic analyses indicated that the amount of
ethylbenzene which dissolved into sterile HCMM2 broth (in
a petri dish placed within a chamber) increased linearly from
0.018 ,uM/ml to 0.08 VLM/ml between 8 and 145 h (unpublished
data).
All negative-control HCMM2 plates were placed in a
single hydrocarbon-free chamber. Positive-control plates
were prepared by toothpicking cells onto a final plate of R2A
medium (Difco Laboratories, Inc., Detroit, Mich.) and
HCMM2-gasoline medium at the end of each series of

experimental HCMM2 plates. All plates were incubated at
room temperature (about 23°C) for up to 2 weeks and
examined at intervals for bacterial growth. Growth on a
negative-control plate nullified use of that particular isolate
in the study. Absence of growth on R2A or HCMM2-
gasoline plates was interpreted as failure to transfer cells to
the experimental hydrocarbon plates, and results were rejected
for all plates in the series. Thus, failure to grow was
not a result of insufficient transfer of viable cells. Positive
growth was interpreted as biodegradation of the test hydrocarbon
(not necessarily complete mineralization) coupled
with cellular growth, and the isolate was considered to
exhibit catabolic activity. Growth of Pseudomonas putida
(strain SB2-091686-54g) from the study site in a continuousflow,
sand-filled column was correlated with removal of
benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene as determined by GCFID
analysis (unpublished data). These same hydrocarbons
also served as sole growth substrates for this isolate in the
vapor assay described above, indicating that growth on
vapors could be used to infer actual catabolism of a hydrocarbon.

25.2 jig of Na2MoO4- 2H20; 15.0 g of Bacto-Agar (Difco);
and 1 liter of distilled water. The pH of RL medium was
adjusted to 7.2, and vitamins were added after it was
autoclaved as a filter-sterilized solution. Colonies were
toothpicked from RL plates to 96-well microtiter plates, each
well containing 100 pAl of sterile RL medium supplemented
with 20 ,uCi of [35S]sulfate (specific activity, 25 to 40 Ci/mg;
Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill.). Sulfate was employed
as a label instead of [35S]methionine, since many
isolates failed to efficiently incorporate the latter. Microtiter
plates were incubated at 28°C in sterile, sealed plastic bags
(to prevent evaporation) until growth was visible (usually 2
days). Cells were rinsed from wells with 50 pd of sterile,
deionized water and transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge
tube, and proteins were solubilized by addition of an equal
volume of double-strength lysis buffer containing 0.125 M
Tris buffer (adjusted to pH 8.3 with 2.0 N HCl), 4.0%
(wt/vol) SDS, 10.0% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol, and
0.005% (wt/vol) bromophenol blue (all from Sigma Chemical

5 min, and then sonicated for 5 min with an equal volume of
0.15-mm zirconium oxide beads by using a Heat Systems,
Inc., model 450 ultrasonic processor equipped with a cup

SDS-PAGE method. Solubilized proteins were loaded onto
12% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide gels and subjected to electrophoresis
for 20 min at 20 W and then at 60 W for approximately
2 h at 8°C by using a refrigerated, computer-controlled
electrophoresis system (AMBIS, Inc., San Diego,
Calif. [14]). Gels were dried and scanned for radioactivity
incorporated into cellular proteins with an AMBIS, Mark II,
computer-programmed beta radioactivity scanner. A detailed
description of this system has been reported by Hook
et al-. (14) and Smith (25).
Scanning and analysis of SDS-PAGE gels. Scan data were
automatically retrieved and stored on the hard disk of an
IBM-PC/AT microcomputer as individual SDS-PAGE lane
files. Lane files were adjusted and normalized according to
'4C-labeled molecular weight standards consisting of lysozyme
(14,300 Da), ,-lactoglobulin (18,400 Da), carbonic
anhydrase (29,000 Da), ovalbumin (43,000 Da), bovine serum
albumin (68,000 Da), phosphorylase b (97,400 Da), and
H-chain myosin (200,000 Da) (Bethesda Research Laboratories,

solution of each 14C-methylated standard was 3,100 dpm/mg
of protein. The length of each lane was adjusted and normalized
by electronically clipping the ends of the lanes at two
locations, one corresponding to phosphorylase b and the
second corresponding to P-lactoglobulin. To further account
for gel variations, lane files were normalized by using
software that stretched or compressed banding profiles to a
standard length and stored them as adjusted lane files.
Adjusted lane files were transformed into Fourier space by
using appropriate algorithms and were then searched for
matches or compared with one another by using dendrogram
software described elsewhere (14, 15, 19-21). Isolates were
sorted into groups and assigned Fourier or Pearson correlation
coefficients (14). A coefficient of 1.0 indicates an exact
match between two banding patterns. In actual practice,
experimental error, gel variations, and machine noise limited
resolution to a correlation coefficient of about 0.93 for
multiple runs of the same isolate (unpublished data). Previous
studies indicated that microorganisms correlated above
0.90 are very closely related and are typically members of
the same species or subspecies (14, 15, 19-21). Therefore,
isolates with protein-banding profiles correlated at >0.90
were placed into the same group (referred to as an AMBIS
group).
Bacterial identification by conventional methods. Conventional
identification of gasoline-degrading bacteria was performed
by morphological examinations, Gram- and flagellum-staining
reactions, oxidative/fermentative analyses, and
inoculation and reading of NFT biochemical strips obtained
from Analytab Products, Inc., Plainview, N.Y. Strips were
routinely incubated at 28°C.
RESULTS
Hydrocarbon degradation patterns of isolates. Catabolic
activities of 297 isolates were evaluated by recording aerobic
growth responses on the 15 different hydrocarbon substrates
which were gradually introduced as vapors in sealed vessels
(see Materials and Methods). Bacteria degrading the same
hydrocarbon(s) were included in the same catabolic group. A
total of 111 catabolic groups were delineated among the
isolates screened (Fig. 2). The types of hydrocarbons catabolized
by each group varied widely, but the majority of
isolates favored the substituted monoaromatics as growth
substrates, which is consistent with in situ adaptation to
aromatic compounds prevalent in groundwater at this site
(unpublished data).
A total of 17 catabolic groups included degradation of the
multiply branched alkane 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, and 12
groups degraded the branched cyclic alkane methylcyclopentane.
Group 14 was unusual, since its members failed to
grow on any of the 15 test hydrocarbons, suggesting that
these isolates required one or more gasoline hydrocarbons
other than the 15 evaluated. Each of the 15 test hydrocarbons
was biodegraded by at least one of the 297 isolates,
suggesting that the primary hydrocarbon categories of gasoline
could be aerobically biodegraded in situ given appropriate
conditions.
Several catabolic groups (e.g., groups 38, 47, 75, 84, 94,
and 105) included degradation of a single test hydrocarbon.
Such groups were not the most frequently observed, as
might be suspected because of their simplicity, suggesting
that maintenance of multiple catabolic abilities might provide
some selective advantage. Catabolic groups which
included degradation of five or more test hydrocarbons were
likewise infrequently observed (e.g., groups 42, 45, 51, 61,

utilize different numbers of test hydrocarbons is plotted in
Fig. 3. Inspection of these data indicates that most isolates
were able to grow on 2 or 3 different test hydrocarbons,
suggesting that retention of other numbers of catabolic
activities might not offer selective advantage at this site.
The frequency of occurrence of the 111 catabolic groups
defined above is shown in Fig. 4. Given the 15 test hydrocarbons

equal to that of observing any other, resulting in a completely
random distribution (assuming group independence
and absence of selection). However, a random distribution
was not observed, since groups 1 to 10 were the most
common, representing greater than 57% of the 297 isolates
analyzed (Fig. 4). Eight of these groups included degradation
of toluene, which was the most frequently utilized test
hydrocarbon. Departure of observed group frequency data

existence of biologically favored combinations of hydrocarbon
catabolic pathways.
Growth screening also permitted determination of the
frequencies at which specific test hydrocarbons were utilized
by isolates. The frequencies of specific hydrocarbon degradation
for 297 of the Seal Beach isolates are presented in Fig.
5. Alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, p-xylene,
ethylbenzene, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene were most
frequently utilized. Approximately 75% of isolates were
capable of growth on toluene vapors as a sole carbon and
energy source. Benzene and naphthalene were less frequently
degraded than most substituted aromatics with the
exception of o-xylene, which was degraded less frequently
than either compound or than its isomeric counterpart,
p-xylene. It is interesting to note that more than 150 toluenedegrading
isolates were unable to utilize toluene present as a
contaminant in o-xylene (Table 2), suggesting that the concentrations
of contaminating hydrocarbons were too low to
support growth. The least frequently degraded compounds
included the cyclic branched alkanes 2,2,4-trimethylpentane,
2-methylbutane, and methylcyclopentane. Unsubstituted
linear and cyclic alkanes such as octane and cycloheptane
were utilized at frequencies intermediate between those
of the aromatics and branched alkanes.
Polypeptide-banding pattern analysis of isolates. A total of
220 gasoline-degrading isolates was characterized by computer-programmed
SDS-PAGE analysis to further explore
genetic and taxonomic heterogeneity among the sample
population. The dendrogram-generating algorithms which
were employed restricted analyses to 75 isolates, which
necessitated construction of four separate dendrograms to
accommodate the 220 isolates. Bacteria composing the four
initial dendrograms were sorted into tentative groups (AMBIS
groups), each exhibiting intracorrelations of 0.90 or
greater. Representative strains (totaling less than 75) from
each of the tentative AMBIS groups were subsequently used
to construct a fifth, composite dendrogram to determine
which tentative groups were unique. Using this iterative
strategy, a total of 51 distinct AMBIS groups were resolved,
and the relationship between these is indicated in Fig. 6.
Confirmatory dendrograms (not shown) were performed on
each of the 51 AMBIS groups to ensure that members of
each were correlated above the 0.90 level.
Inspection of the dendrogram shown in Fig. 6 indicates
that the Seal Beach isolates were organized into two broad
clusters which were discriminated by a correlation value of
about 0.47. The upper cluster consisted of the first 13
AMBIS groups, while the lower cluster comprised the remainder
of the 51 groups. Each cluster was composed of
members correlated with one another at a level of about 0.55
or higher. The largest AMBIS group, 33, contained 21
members, whereas 21 groups contained only one member
isolate.
Test hydrocarbons collectively utilized by members composing
each AMBIS group are also indicated in Fig. 6. The
most catabolically diverse bacteria composed the lower
cluster. These isolates were able to catabolize all 15 test
hydrocarbons. AMBIS groups 24, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 39, 41,
and 43 included members which were particularly versatile
in terms of hydrocarbon usage. In contrast, the upper
cluster, which comprised the first 13 AMBIS groups, included
isolates which were more restricted catabolically
(and taxonomically; see below) than those in the lower
cluster. Alkanes served as growth substrates for only one of
the upper-cluster groups (AMBIS group 12), the remainder
degrading only substituted aromatics. However, benzene
and o-xylene were biodegraded more frequently by members
of the lower cluster. Because members of single AMBIS
groups often displayed different growth responses on a given
test hydrocarbon, it was not feasible to reliably predict
catabolic activity from protein-banding information.
A total of 244 isolates (including the 220 analyzed by
SDS-PAGE) were identified by conventional nutritional and
biochemical tests to determine whether useful phylogenetic
information could be extracted from protein-banding and
catabolic-screening data. Nearly half (48.4%) of the 244

CATABOLIC ACTIVITY OF GASOLINE-DEGRADING BACTERIA
isolates were recovered from groundwater samples from
well 8; the remainder were obtained from five other wells
(wells 2, 7, 14, 30, and 32). Of 121 gasoline-degrading isolates
recovered from well 8 groundwater, 118 were identified as
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In all, nine species of pseudomonads
were identified, including P. aeruginosa (55.7%),
P. putida (18.4%), P. stutzeri (7.4%), P. fluorescens (0.82%),
P. acidovorans (0.82%), P. pickettii (0.41%), P. maltophilia
(1.2%), P. alcaligenes (1.6%), and P. cepacia (0.41%). Other
identifications included Alcaligenes denitrificans (0.82%),
Micrococcus spp. (10.7%), and Nocardia spp. (1.2%).
The majority of P. aeruginosa strains exhibited similar
protein-banding patterns and hydrocarbon catabolic activities
(see above), cosegregating into the upper cluster of the
dendrogram (Fig. 6), where they formed the first 13 AMBIS
groups. A few P. aeruginosa isolates, however, displayed
protein-banding patterns which differed significantly from
the main body of isolates included in the upper cluster, and
these cosegregated near the bottom of the dendrogram
(AMBIS groups 49 to 51). P. aeruginosa isolates composing
AMBIS groups 12 and 49 exhibited unusual catabolic activities
compared with other P. aeruginosa groups, since they
grew on selected alkanes, including hexane, octane, decane,
cyclohexane, and methylcyclopentane in addition to the
more frequently catabolized aromatics. Inclusion of these
catabolically anomalous strains in P. aeruginosa is, therefore,
suspect. P. putida, P. stutzeri, and the Micrococcus
spp. were capable of catabolizing most alkanes and were
distributed throughout the mid to lower regions of the
dendrogram (Fig. 6).
DISCUSSION
The principal advantage of vapor-phase growth tests such
as those employed in this investigation is that they can be
performed much more rapidly than more complex chemical
analytical methods, thereby permitting the examination of
large numbers of isolates with multiple hydrocarbon substrates
in a reasonable time frame. Unlike batch culture
techniques in which a single hydrocarbon concentration is
typically employed, tests using hydrocarbon vapors offer
organisms a range of substrate concentrations, if vapors are
introduced gradually as was done in this study. Such a
technique increases the likelihood of a positive growth
response within some favorable concentration range of hydrocarbon.
Assuming purity of the carbon source and inclusion
of appropriate negative controls (e.g., incubation in the
absence of substrate), a positive result is unambiguous and
may be interpreted as catabolic (i.e., biodegradative) activity
coupled to cellular growth.
If test hydrocarbons are not absolutely pure, then a
positive growth response could result from utilization of
contaminant hydrocarbons. However, this possibility was
unlikely, since more than 90 isolates which grew on toluene
as a sole carbon source were unable to utilize this same
substrate when it was present as a contaminant in ethylbenzene
at a level of approximately 0.8% (wt/wt) (Fig. 5; Table
FIG. 6. Composite dendrogram showing 51 AMBIS groupings

patterns. Upper- and lower-cluster regions are indicated. Test

2). Similarly, nearly 150 toluene-degrading isolates failed to
utilize toluene present as a contaminant in o-xylene (the
least-pure test substrate [Table 2]) at a concentration of 2.7%
(wt/wt). These observations suggest that the concentrations
of contaminant hydrocarbons were insufficient to support
the growth of gasoline-degrading isolates examined in this
study.
As in all studies that employ growth responses on singlecarbon
substrates, a negative result may be interpreted as (i)
lack of a functional catabolic pathway or transport system,
(ii) insufficient concentration of the test substrate (i.e.,
inadequate bioavailability), or (iii) biotoxicity. In addition, a
negative growth response does not imply that a compound
cannot be cometabolized or syntrophically utilized. It may
be argued that inadequate bioavailability was not responsible
for negative results in the present study, since all isolates
grew on gasoline vapors in which the concentrations of
individual hydrocarbon components were lower than those
of the single test hydrocarbons subsequently employed. In
addition, test hydrocarbons could have been expected to
approach equilibrium concentrations at the surfaces of the
agar plates given the lengthy incubation periods employed.
Inadequate bioavailability may also be discounted on
grounds that different isolates in the same subspecies group
(e.g., P. putida in AMBIS group 33) often displayed different
catabolic patterns, such that one or more hydrocarbons were
utilized by one strain but not by another. To account for
such discrepancies in substrate utilization, it must be postulated
(i) that significant differences existed among otherwise
closely related strains with regard to hydrocarbon affinity,
transport kinetics, or other factors that could restrict bioavailability
or (ii) that strains exhibited markedly different
susceptibilities to the biotoxic effects of the same hydrocarbon.
Whereas strain differences in specific-hydrocarbon
affinity or toxicity are admittedly feasible, they have not
been documented nor would they necessarily be expected in
such closely related isolates. Moreover, assuming that such
differences did exist, there is no a priori reason to suspect
that they would have been of sufficient magnitude to account
for the marked differences in growth responses of different
strains on the same hydrocarbon. Furthermore, it may be
inferred that none of the 15 test hydrocarbons was generally
cytotoxic at levels employed in this study; otherwise, no
isolate would have exhibited growth on that compound. In
contrast, every test hydrocarbon was found to support the
growth of at least one gasoline-degrading isolate.
However, since biotoxicity or bioavailability was not
rigorously proven or disproven, the growth response data
tend to provide a conservative estimate of catabolic potential.
Thus, catabolic groups defined by using vapor-phase
growth tests might have hydrocarbon catabolic activities
other than those actually observed. Despite this inherent
conservatism, all gasoline hydrocarbon categories tested
were found to have been directly catabolized under aerobic
conditions. For purposes of predicting bioremediative feasibility
at a hydrocarbon-contaminated site, a conservative
estimate of catabolic potential provides a safer margin for
error than a more liberal estimate of degradative ability.
Given the qualifications discussed above, results of
growth-screening tests and other methods employed in this
investigation indicate that there was considerable physiologic
and genetic heterogeneity among gasoline-degrading
bacteria associated with the Seal Beach site. It is interesting
to note that the growth-screening technique employed provided
greater phenotypic resolution than one-dimensional
protein-banding information, since a total of 111 catabolic

groups were defined compared with 51 AMBIS groups. This
difference was not entirely unexpected, since some catabolic
enzymes having different substrate specificities might exhibit
similar or identical mobilities in polyacrylamide gels. Furthermore,
many catabolic enzymes may be present in cells at
levels too low to be readily detectable in whole-cell protein
preparations, thereby precluding their use as discriminatory
signals in polyacrylamide gels.
It is noteworthy that different members of the same
species (e.g., P. aeruginosa or P. putida) often differed
significantly with respect to their protein-banding patterns.
This result is primarily attributable to the somewhat
arbitrary use of a conservative correlation limit of 0.90 in
constructing dendrograms and defining isolate groups. Delineation
of AMBIS groups on the basis of a lower correlation
value (e.g., 0.75) would have resulted in broader
taxonomic groupings; however, significant discrepancies between
banding pattern groups and conventional identifications
would still have occurred. Thus, the use of onedimensional
protein-banding pattern analysis to reliably infer
phylogenetic relationships was limited in this study. Evidently,
protein-banding information is not always adequately
conserved for this purpose, even at the species level. Nevertheless,
the protein-banding patterns were reproducible,
and isolates composing each of the 51 AMBIS groups were
consistently identified to the same species or subspecies.
Thus, protein-banding information must be viewed in this
study primarily as a means of resolving strain or subspecies
differences, not as a technique for inferring phylogenetic
relationships.
Results of growth tests indicated that isolates displayed a
predilection for aromatic hydrocarbons. Aromatic hydrocarbons
constitute a major fraction of gasoline (24), and these
compounds are more water soluble and less volatile than
many aliphatic constituents. These characteristics favor the
prevalence of aromatic hydrocarbons in groundwater contaminated
by gasoline (5, 18, 29), and previous GC analyses
of groundwater samples from the Seal Beach site are consistent
with these concepts (unpublished data). Given the
age of the plume (>6 years), it seems plausible that bacteria
at the site might have had adequate time for significant
physiologic and genetic adaptation to the aromatic fraction,
which is consistent with the observed preference of the
isolates for this hydrocarbon category.
The majority of isolates were able to use only 2 or 3
different test hydrocarbons as growth substrates (Fig. 3).
This observation is intriguing, since it may reflect an optimum
level of catabolic potential that is inherently maintained
by cells from this environment. Aside from arguments
concerning unfavorable energetics, there is no a priori
reason to expect that more catabolic activities could not
have been maintained. Indeed, a number of catabolic groups
included individual isolates that degraded nearly all of the 15
test hydrocarbons, but these bacteria represented a small
minority. It is interesting to speculate on the purpose of
maintaining multiple degradative pathways for compounds
that have little resemblance to one another (e.g., an alkane
and an aromatic). It is not known whether these catabolic
pathways are simultaneously expressed and active in the
environment or whether certain pathways are repressed
while others remain functional. Additional biochemical and
physiological studies will be needed to resolve these questions.
Frequencies of test hydrocarbon utilization by the Seal
Beach isolates differed somewhat from those of 32 gasolinedegrading
isolates analyzed by Jamison and co-workers (16,
17). For example, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane was the most frequently
biodegraded test hydrocarbon in the Jamison study
(frequency of degradation, 60%), whereas this same substrate
was utilized by about 7% of the 297 Seal Beach
isolates examined. In addition, while p-xylene was infrequently
utilized by the Jamison isolates (<15%), it was the
second-most-utilized compound among the Seal Beach bacteria.
Toluene and ethylbenzene were among the most
frequently utilized hydrocarbons in both investigations. Bacteria
able to catabolize o-xylene, methylcyclopentane, and
cyclohexane were not isolated by Jamison, though each of
these hydrocarbons was biodegraded by a consortium growing
on gasoline, suggesting cooxidative or syntrophic processes.
It is possible that bacteria existed at the Jamison site
that could directly degrade these hydrocarbons, but they
were not detected because of the low number of isolates
screened.
In the Jamison investigation, isolates were obtained from
groundwater following in situ injection of nutrients and
oxygen. Thus, growth of aerobic gasoline-degrading bacteria
may have been enhanced relative to the Seal Beach aquifer,
which is anoxic and largely depleted of inorganic nutrients
(e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus [unpublished data]). In situ
bioremediation via nutrient injection and recycling establishes
subsurface conditions which favor development of
certain hydrocarbon-degrading phenotypes while suppressing
the growth of others. Quantitative data are needed to
better understand and delineate the relationship between
microbial community structure and perturbation of in situ
conditions by invasive bioremediative techniques.
