Summary
A diesel-degrading bacterium (strain IU5) isolated from oil-contaminated soil was characterized in this study. Fatty
acid and 16s rDNA sequence analysis identified IU5 as a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and growth curve
experiments identified the bacterium’s optimum conditions as pH 7 and 30 C. P. aeruginosa IU5 degraded up to
60% of applied diesel (8500 mg/kg) over 13 days in a soil-slurry phase. In addition, this strain was able to grow on
many other petroleum hydrocarbons as sole carbon sources, including crude oil, gasoline, benzene, toluene, xylene,
and even PAHs such as naphthalene, phenanthrene and pyrene. Therefore, P. aeruginosa IU5 may be useful for
bioremediation of soils and groundwater contaminated with a variety of hydrocarbons.
Introduction
Diesel contains many highly concentrated toxic materials
(Dillard et al. 1997; Gold-Bouchot et al. 1997), and
diesel contamination can negatively influence soil
microbes and plants, as well as contaminate groundwater,
which may be used for drinking or agriculture.
Because of this, a variety of methods have been
developed to treat diesel contamination. While many
of the established physical and chemical methods are
efficient, they are also expensive and can cause recontamination
by secondary contaminants.
Bioremediation is the microbial degradation of
organic pollutants such as petroleum in soil and
groundwater. This technique has the benefits of high
treatment efficiency, low cost, relatively quick action,
in site and ex site application, and compatibility with
other techniques. Nevertheless, the application of
hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in oil-contaminated
sites does not guarantee to remove all components of
crude oil because some components still remain difficult
to degrade, such as alkanes of shorter and longer chains
(<C10 and C20–C40) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) (Yuste et al. 2000). So it is meaningful to
find a new bacterial strain that can metabolize a broad
range of the hydrocarbons contained in crude oil,
especially the highly persistent components.
Thus, since the discovery of new strain(s) and the
finding of optimum conditions of diesel-degrading
bacteria for the enhancement of microbial activity are
vital to economically and effectively amelionating contaminated
soils and groundwater, here we sought to
isolate a diesel-degrading bacterium and examine its
characteristics and abilities to degrade diesel and other
petroleum hydrocarbons.
Materials and methods
Isolation of diesel-degrading bacteria
This study used crude oil-contaminated soils as inocula
for isolating diesel-degrading bacteria. Contaminated
soil samples were collected from sites near a gas station
in Incheon, Korea, and a gas station in Ulsan, Korea.
For culture enrichment, we added 10 g contaminated
soil and 2 ml diesel (v/v, 1%) in 200 ml Bushnell Haas
(BH) medium. Samples were cultivated at 30 C and
180 rev/min for 7 days, and the inoculum culture (5%,
v/v) was transferred into 1% (v/v) diesel-added BH
medium. Nine microbial strains (IU1, IU2, IU3, IU4,
IU5, IU6, U1, U2 and U3) were distinguished based on
morphological differences among the colonies on LB
plates. IU5 was finally selected as the most active strain

for diesel-degradation based on the relative activity
(Figure 1).
Identification of the most effective diesel-degrading
bacterium
Fatty acid and 16s rDNA analyses were performed to
identify the isolated strain IU5. First, IU5 was phenotypically
characterized by fatty acid methyl ester content
(FAME) analysis using gas chromatography (Thompson
et al. 1993), with the results analysed using a MIDI
system (Kim et al. 2003). For the 16s rDNA analysis,
genomic DNA was extracted with the alkaline lysis
method, and 16s rDNA was amplified in PCR using the
genomic DNA as template and bacterial universal
primers, 341f (5¢-CCT ACG GGA GGC AGC AG-3¢)
and 907r (5¢-CCC CGT CAA TTC ATT TGA GTT-3¢).
The PCR reactions contained 1 ll template, 2.5 ll
10·Buffer, 0.5 lg/ll BAS, 200 lM dNTP mixture,
20 pmol primers (each), and 0.5 U/ll Taq polymerase
(total volume: 25 ll). The reactions were preheated at
95 C for 5 min, followed by 16 cycles of 95 C for
1 min, annealing for 1 min (starting at 63 C and
decreasing 1 C every second cycle), and 72 C for
1 min. This was followed by 14 cycles of 95 C for
1 min, 55 C for 1 min and 72 C for 1 min, with an
additional 5 min at 72 C as a final extension step. The
amplification products were purified using the PCR
purification kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany)
and checked for expected product size (550 bp) by
agarose gel electrophoresis (100 V, 25 min). The nucleotide
sequence was established directly from the PCR
product using primer T7. Species identification was
made by comparison with GenBank database using
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis.
Liquid culture on diesel and various petroleum
hydrocarbons
For measurement of diesel-degrading ability, 50 ll (1%,
v/v) of inoculum and 50 ll (1%, v/v) of diesel (as a
carbon source) were incubated with shaking (30 C and
180 rev/min) in 4.90 ml BH media. To determine the
maximum specific growth rates and maximum dieseldegrading
rates, 12.5 ll of diesel was applied and all
other conditions were maintained. To obtain the optimal
growth conditions of IU5, 100 ll (2%) of IU5
culture and 50 ll (1%) of diesel were added to 4.85 ml
BH media and cultivated with mixing at 10, 20, and
30 C, respectively. At each temperature, the sample pH
was adjusted at 5, 6, 7 and 8 using phosphate buffer, and
the diesel-degrading capacity was investigated by GC
analysis of the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH)
concentrations.
To test potential degradation of other petroleum
hydrocarbons by IU5, we examined the microbe’s
growth characteristics on benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene
and xylene (BTEX) (0.1% (v/v) of each), PAHs (naphthalene,
phenanthrene and pyrene) (0.025% (w/w) of
each), gasoline, diesel and crude oil (1.0% (v/v) of each).
IU5 culture [1% (v/v)] was inoculated into each hydrocarbon
medium, samples were cultivated at 30 C and
180 rev/min for 72 or 144 h, and growth was measured
by OD600 nm.
Soil-slurry culture on diesel
For diesel-degradation tests, soil was obtained from
the campus at Ewha Woman’s University, Seoul,
Korea. To equalize soil particles, the soil was airdried,
passed through 850 and 600 lm sieves and
oven-dried at 80 C for 24 h. Five grams of soil, 4 ml
of IU5 culture and 50 ll of diesel were mixed, sealed
and cultivated in incubator at 30 C. To extract the
total petroleum hydrocarbons, 5 ml hexane was
added to the culture solutions, three of which were
used every 6 or 12 h for GC analysis and biomass
measurement.
Analysis of diesel and biomass
TPH extracted into the hexane (upper) layer was mixed
well, filtered and then analysed by GC (Hewlett Packard
Series II 5890, FL, USA) with a flame ionization
detector, using an HP-5 capillary column (30 m length,
0.23 mm internal diameter and 2.5 lm film thickness).
The GC program was set up as described in our previous
study (Kim et al. 2003). External diesel in hexane was
used for calibration, and the TPH standard was used as
the internal standard (ASTM D5442 C12-C60 quantitative
linearity standard, Supelco) (Bellefonte, PA, USA).
Biomass was measured in the aqueous phase (lower
layer) by monitoring attendance (OD) at 600 nm using a
spectrophotometer (Milton-Roy Spectronic 20, USA).

Results and discussion
The diesel-degrading capabilities of all nine isolates were
tested using the hexadecane (C16) reduction ratio as
representing degradation of diesel compounds. Of the
nine tested isolates, IU5 was best able to degrade diesel
(Figure 1); when diesel was supplemented as a sole
carbon source, the growth rate of IU5 was estimated as
0.11 h)1
, the diesel-degradation rate as 0.2 g g-cell)1 d)1
(0.4 g l)1 d)1
), and the growth yield as 0.25 g-cell
g-diesel)1
. This strain was classified as Pseudomonas
aeruginosa based on MIDI results showing 97% homology
(main cellular fatty acids: C 16:00, C 18:1) and 16s
rDNA sequencing showing 98% homology. Also, five
other isolated strains (IU1, IU2, IU4, IU6, and U2)
were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa based on
MIDI results. Our finding was consistent with a
previous report which found that Pseudomonas sp. was
the most degradative bacterium in a mixed bacterial
consortium isolated from oil-contaminated soil samples
(Rahman et al. 2002).
We next examined the growth properties of this
isolate on various petroleum hydrocarbons other than
diesel (data not shown). We found that strain IU5 grew
on crude oil equally as well as it grew on diesel, while it
showed a slightly lower affinity for gasoline. In addition,
this strain seemed to degrade many other hydrocarbons
such as benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene, phenanthrene
and pyrene, but not ethylbenzene. This result
implied that a mixture of hydrocarbons stimulated the
growth more than a single kind of hydrocarbon, due to
the presence of more carbon sources. Especially in this
study, we found a strain of P. aeruginosa capable of
using pyrene, which has the most complex ring structure
among the PAHs of crude oil, as a unique carbon source
in pure culture.

Diesel-degrading bacterium IU5 383
Although a previous report mentioned that P. aeruginosa
can use a large variety of carbon sources (Holloway
1996), not all strains can grow on such a broad range
of hydrocarbons. For example, P. aeruginosa RR1
isolated from an oil-contaminated site could not utilize
benzene, toluene and PAHs (naphthalene, phenanthrene,
and pyrene) as a sole carbon source (Yuste et al. 2000),
and P. aeruginosa CM323 obtained from a hydrocarbonpolluted
subsoil could not grow on benzene and xylene,
but on toluene and ethylbenzene (not tested with PAHs)
(Cavalca et al. 2000). Thus, the ability to use a broad
range of hydrocarbons would differentiate this strain as
specific, even within the same species.
Because microbial activity is of paramount importance
to effective bioremediation, we examined the
relative activities of IU5 under different temperature
and pH conditions (data not shown). We found that the
optimum condition for IU5 diesel-degradation was
30 C and pH 7, which is similar to the optimum
conditions of a previously reported crude oil-degrading
consortium (30 C and pH 7.5) (Rahman et al. 2002). P.
aeruginosa IU5 showed 97% activity at 20 C and 74%
activity at pH 5, suggesting that IU5 maintains a
relatively high activity even under acidic conditions and
different temperatures. Otherwise, this strain was restrained
with 10% activity at 10 C and with 19%
activity at pH 8.
The IU5-based degradation of diesel in diesel-contaminated
soil was examined in a soil-slurry system for
13 days (Figure 2). During this time period, IU5 could
degrade a variety of aliphatic hydrocarbons in the soilslurry
phase, with about 60% removal of applied diesel.
Comparison between the gas chromatograms from
day 0 and day 13 (Figure 3a, b) indicated that many
aliphatic hydrocarbons (C10–C24) were removed, regardless
of their chain lengths.
