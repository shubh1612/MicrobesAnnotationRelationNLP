Several types of environmental bacteria that can aerobically degrade various aromatic compounds have
been identified. The catabolic genes in these bacteria have generally been found to form operons, which
promote efficient and complete degradation. However, little is known about the degradation pathways in
bacteria that are difficult to culture in the laboratory. By functionally screening a metagenomic library
created from activated sludge, we had earlier identified 91 fosmid clones carrying genes for extradiol
dioxygenase (EDO), a key enzyme in the degradation of aromatic compounds. In this study, we analyzed
38 of these fosmids for the presence and organization of novel genes for aromatics degradation. Only
two of the metagenomic clones contained complete degradation pathways similar to those found in
known aromatic compound-utilizing bacteria. The rest of the clones contained only subsets of the
pathway genes, with novel gene arrangements. A circular 36.7-kb DNA form was assembled from the
sequences of clones carrying genes belonging to a novel EDO subfamily. This plasmid-like DNA form,
designated pSKYE1, possessed genes for DNA replication and stable maintenance as well as a small set
of genes for phenol degradation; the encoded enzymes, phenol hydroxylase and EDO, are capable of
the detoxification of aromatic compounds. This gene set was found in 20 of the 38 analyzed clones,
suggesting that this ‘detoxification apparatus’ may be widespread in the environment.

in bacteria, and in the natural environment these
bacteria contribute greatly to the breakdown of
aromatic compounds and to the global carbon cycle
(Wittich, 1998; Esteve-Núñez et al., 2001; Furukawa
et al., 2004). The majority of reported bacterial
aromatic degradation processes are aerobic (Gibson
and Harwood, 2002) and comprise series of enzymes
that are usually categorized as either ‘upper’- or
‘lower’-pathway enzymes (Williams and Sayers,
1994). Generally, the enzymes in the upper pathway
transform aromatic compounds to aromatic vicinal
diols. This initial hydroxylation step is performed
by a monoxygenase or dioxygenase that incorporates
an oxygen atom(s) into the aromatic ring (Gibson
and Parales, 2000). The second enzyme in the upper
pathway is dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, which
catalyzes the conversion of dihydrodiol to dihy-

droxy compound. In the lower pathway, the resulting dihydroxylated aromatic compounds are transformed into ring-cleavage products by either
extradiol dioxygenases (EDOs) or intradiol dioxygenases. The subsequent metabolic steps are referred to as meta- or ortho- pathways. Of these
dioxygenases, EDOs can easily be identified due to
their yellow pigmentation of the products and have
been extensively studied (Eltis and Bolin, 1996).
The ring-cleavage products are further degraded into
compounds that can enter the tricarboxylic acid
cycle.
The genes encoding upper- and lower-pathway
enzymes are often clustered into operons, and the
varied combinations of upper and lower pathways
provide diverse functions. Point mutations in conjunction with various gene rearrangements (for
example, insertion, deletion, duplication and inversion) further promote the functional diversity of
genes and gene clusters (van der Meer et al., 1992).
The presence of foreign compounds can lead to the
selection of mutant bacteria that are capable of
metabolizing them. Aromatic catabolism genes are
often harbored by mobile genetic elements (for
example, plasmids, transposons and integrative
and conjugative elements) that effectively disseminate the catabolic traits to phylogenetically diverse
bacteria (Tsuda et al., 1999; Top and Springael,
2003; Nojiri et al., 2004).
However, because the generalizations described
above come only from studies of those bacteria that
can be cultivated under standard laboratory conditions, they are probably biased. As the vast majority
(499%) of bacteria in the natural environment are
difficult to culture in the laboratory, and are thought
to differ greatly from known cultured ones (Amann
et al., 1995), the not-yet cultivated bacteria may
possess novel genes, enzymes or pathways. In
addition, the aromatic compound-degrading bacteria thus far analyzed were isolated on the basis of
their ability to utilize aromatics as their sole carbon
and energy sources. This approach can isolate only
those bacteria that possess all of the genes necessary
to completely degrade aromatic compounds. Efforts
have been made to directly obtain genes and pathways for aromatics catabolism using methods independent of bacterial culture (Galvao et al., 2005;
Mohn et al., 2006). For example, Junca and Pieper
(2004) and Sipilä et al. (2008) relied on a PCR-based
approach to assess the diversity of EDO genes in the
environment. However, these sequence-driven approaches still suffer from bias, in this case from the
primer sequences selected for PCR.
To overcome these drawbacks, we previously
employed a function-driven metagenomic approach
(Suenaga et al., 2007). Using environmental DNA
samples prepared from an activated sludge used to
treat coke plant wastewater containing various aromatic compounds, we constructed a metagenomic
fosmid library in Escherichia coli. Using catechol as a
substrate, we screened the library for EDO activities.
The ISME Journal

Of the resulting 91 fosmid clones expressing EDO
activities, 38 were subjected to DNA sequencing,
which resulted in the identification of 43 EDO genes.
Comparison of the amino acid sequences of these
EDOs with those of previously reported EDOs
revealed that more than half (25) of our newly
identified EDOs were from novel subfamilies: I.1.C
(2 clones), I.2.G (20 clones), I.3.M (2 clones) and I.3.N
(1 clone). This result suggested a striking difference
between the aromatics-degradation genes in our target
microbial community and those that were previously
identified in known bacteria through culture-dependent approaches. In this study, we investigated the
organization of the degradation pathway genes in the
38 sequenced fosmid clones.

Materials and methods
DNA sequencing and gene annotation

Shotgun DNA sequencing was performed at the
Dragon Genomics Center (Mie, Japan) as described
previously (Suenaga et al., 2007). Sequences were
assembled using Paracel Transcript Assembler software (Paracel Inc., Pasadena, CA, USA). Open
reading frames (ORFs) were identified using Artemis software (Rutherford et al., 2000), which was
also used to calculate %(G þ C) content. BLAST
searches (Altschul et al., 1997) were carried out
against the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank DNA databases,
and the final ORF annotations were made manually.
Conserved amino acid sequences were identified
using the InterProScan (Quevillon et al., 2005) and
Pfam (Finn et al., 2008) programs. A tRNA gene
search was carried out using the tRNAscan-SE
program (Lowe and Eddy, 1997). Self-organization
map (SOM) analysis (Abe et al., 2003) was performed using each 5-kb DNA window of inserts as a
query. Pairwise nucleotide sequence comparisons
were made and visualized using the GenomeMatcher program (Ohtsubo et al., 2008). The nucleotide
sequences reported here have been deposited in
GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession numbers
AB266111–AB266148 and AB471759–AB471780.
Functional characterization of selected degradation
gene clusters

PCR-mediated subcloning was used to clone some of
the degradation pathway genes from fosmids 2C5
and 9C3 and from the fosmids carrying I.2.G
subfamily EDOs. PCR was carried out with oligonucleotide primers (Supplementary Table S1). The
amplicons were digested with XbaI and cloned into
the XbaI site (2C5) or XbaI–HincII site (9C3 and I.2.G
EDO genes) of pUC18 so that transcription of the
inserted genes was under the control of the vectorderived lac promoter. E. coli JM109 cells carrying
the recombinant plasmids were grown at 37 1C in
Luria–Bertani (LB) medium (Sambrook and Russell,
2001) containing 50 mg ml1 ampicillin and 0.1 mM
isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside.

Results and discussion
General features of the metagenomic fosmid inserts

Shotgun DNA sequencing was employed for 38
fosmids. Single contigs were obtained for 22
fosmids. Table 1 summarizes the general features
of the fosmid inserts, which together amounted to
1.5 Mb. The insert fragments ranged from 29.1 kb to
41.6 kb in length, from 53.9% to 69.3% in G þ C
content, and from 26 to 45 in the number of ORFs. In
total, there were 1317 ORFs.
As no rRNA genes were found, the microbial
origins of the insert fragments were predicted by
SOM (self-organization map) analysis, which suggested that the majority of the metagenomic fragments originated from phylum Proteobacteria. This
finding might represent an initial screening bias
resulting from the use of E. coli as the host. The
predicted functions of the 1317 ORFs are summarized in Table 2, and a complete list of ORFs
describing their position, %(G þ C) content, predicted function, predicted microbial origin and
closest homologs in public databases is shown in
Supplementary Table S2. When the 1317 ORFs were
classified on the basis of their predicted function
and compared with those identified in purely
cultivated aromatics-utilizing bacteria, the metagenomic DNA fragments displayed a lower proportion
of aromatics-degrading genes and a higher proportion of genes for replication/maintenance/processing of DNA, conjugative transfer and DNA
transposition and site-specific recombination than
those in the genomes of cultivated strains. The
details are described in the Supplementary information and in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4.

Diverse genetic organization of aromatic degradation
genes in metagenomic DNA

The genetic organization of representative fosmid
inserts is depicted in Figure 1, and the details of the
ORFs for all fosmid inserts are shown in Supplementary Figures S1, S2 and S3. Most EDO genes
were flanked by genes or gene clusters predicted to
be involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds. These gene products showed moderate to
significant levels of identity with well-studied
catabolic enzymes from isolated bacteria; these
enzymes included Dmp proteins from the phenolcatabolizing plasmid pVI150 of Pseudomonas sp.
CF600 (Shingler et al., 1992), Phe proteins from the
phenol-utilizing strain Bacillus thermoglucosidasius A7 (Duffner et al., 2000), Tdn proteins from
the aniline-catabolizing plasmid pTDN1 of P. putida
UCC22 (Fukumori and Saint, 2001), Nah proteins
from the naphthalene-catabolizing plasmid NAH7 of
P. putida G7 (Sota et al., 2006a) and Nag proteins
from the naphthalene-utilizing strain Ralstonia sp.
U2 (Zhou et al., 2001). Schematic drawings of
these pathways are shown in Figures 2–5. Notably,
(i) these known aromatics degraders generally carry

1337

one or two well-organized gene clusters that allow
the complete degradation of aromatic compounds to
pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, and (ii) the gene clusters
are usually arranged according to the order of the
reactions. We refer to these representative pathways
identified in isolates in discussing the properties of
our fosmid fragments below.
Fosmids carrying I.2.A EDO genes. A representative EDO belonging to the I.2.A subfamily is catechol
2,3-dioxygenase. I.2.A EDOs are frequently found in
Pseudomonas spp. and are involved in the degradation of single-ring aromatic compounds (for example,
phenol and toluene) and naphthalene (Eltis and
Bolin, 1996). The first step in bacterial phenol
degradation is, in most cases, monohydroxylation
of phenol at the ortho-position to form catechol.
This reaction is performed by a phenol hydroxylase
comprising a single component (such as PheA from
B. stearothermophilus BR219 (Kim and Oriel,
1995)), two components (such as PheAB from B.
thermoglucosidasius A7 (Duffner et al., 2000)), or
multiple components (such as DmpKLMNOP from
pVI150 (Shingler et al., 1992)) (Figures 2 and 5).
Plasmid pVI150 carries a catabolic dmp operon
containing 15 structural genes that encode a multicomponent-type phenol hydroxylase (DmpKLMNOP)
and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (DmpB). The complete
degradation of the 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde
formed by the DmpB reaction is carried out by the
enzymes encoded by dmpCDEHFGI. Among our
metagenomic fosmid inserts, I.2.A EDO genes were
found in five fosmids that were classified into three
subtypes (2C5, 3A2 and 5F10) depending on their
genetic organization (Figure 1 and Supplementary
Figure S1).
The
fosmid
2C5
appears
to
contain
dmpKLMNOPQBCDEHFGI, a complete gene cluster
comprising ORF2C5-7 to 13 and ORF2C5-15 to
22; this cluster encodes polypeptides calculated to
be 20–78% identical to the Dmp proteins of pVI150
(Figures 1 and 2). Upstream of this gene cluster is
ORF2C5-23, which encodes a deduced polypeptide
that is 61% identical to pVI150-encoded DmpR, a
positive transcriptional regulator of the dmp operon
(Figure 2). When the ORF2C5-15 to 22 cluster,
presumably encoding phenol hydroxylase and EDO,
was subcloned into pUC18, E. coli JM109 cells
carrying the recombinant plasmid produced 2hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (detected by yellow
coloration) on LB agar plates containing phenol,
confirming the activities of the two enzymes.
The predicted products of ORF3A2-1, 3, 5 and
15 to 20 from fosmid 3A2 are 35–79% identical
to two components of phenol hydroxylase (DmpOP)
(ORF3A2-1 and 3), catechol 2,3-dioxygenase
(DmpB) (ORF3A2-5) and the DmpCDEFGH proteins
(ORF3A2-15 to 20) of pVI150 (Figure 1). The
deduced gene product of ORF3A2-14, which was
located upstream of dmpCDEFGH, is 43% identical
to the Orf0 protein, a GntR-type transcriptional

regulator of the biphenyl-catabolizing (bph) operon
of P. pseudoalcaligenes KF707 (Watanabe et al.,
2000). Fosmid types 3A2 and 2C5 differ remarkably
in that the two dmp gene clusters in 3A2 are
separated by an intervening 10-kb sequence that
does not appear to be involved in the degradation of
aromatic compounds. Therefore, the 3A2-type gene
cluster may be an evolutionarily intermediate form
of the 2C5-type complete operon. On the other hand,
some other dmp genes may be located upstream of
ORF3A2-1.
Fosmids 5F10, 2H2 and 9B1 have some DNA
fragments in common (Figure 1 and Supplementary
Figure S1). The nucleotide sequence of ORF5F10-3encoding catechol 2,3-dioxygenase is identical to
those of ORF26 in 6B9 (Figure 1 and Supplementary
Figure S2) and ORF36 in 9E4 (Figure 1 and
Supplementary Figure S3). The deduced gene
products for ORF5F10-3, 5 and 6 show 56%,
60% and 66% identity to DmpB, DmpC and DmpE,
respectively, of pVI150. In these fosmids, only these
three ORFs were predicted to be involved in
aromatics degradation. 5F10 contains four tRNA
genes (for Pro, Arg, His and Lys), indicating that this
DNA fragment is most probably of chromosomal
origin (Figure 1).
Fosmids carrying I.2.B EDO genes. EDOs belonging
to subfamily I.2.B are frequently identified in the
genus Sphingomonas. They include catechol 2,3dioxygenases, involved in the degradation of singlering aromatic compounds (for example, xylenes)
(Eltis and Bolin, 1996). I.2.B EDO genes were borne on
four fosmids, three of which (4D5, 1A9 and 6F5) had
nearly an identical sequence; with the exception that
4D5 carried two I.2.B EDO genes (ORF4D5-30 and
31) (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1).
The deduced amino acid sequences of the
ORF4D5-10 to 17 gene products are 37–70%
identical to those of proteins involved in the
degradation of phenol (DmpQBCEFGH of pVI150)
and aniline (TdnD2C2-Orf4 product-TdnEGIJK of
pTDN1 from P. putida UCC2) (Figure 1). However,
no genes for putative phenol hydroxylase homologs
were identified in the flanking regions, suggesting
that the degradation gene cluster in 4D5 constitutes
only part of a complete degradative pathway and is
likely to work in concert with other upstream
enzyme genes, which might be located at a distant
locus in the same genome or provided by other
organisms.
Fosmid 10D8 carries seven ORFs, ORF10D8-21,
22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 30, which encode
polypeptides calculated to be 37–70% identical to
the gene products of dmpBCEHFGD of pVI150
and tdnC2-Orf4-tdnEGKIJF of pTDN1 (Figure 1).
ORF10D8-24 was predicted to be a GntR-type
transcriptional regulator. Unlike other well-studied
meta-pathway gene clusters, this putative regulator
gene is positioned in the middle of the degradation
gene cluster.

and Burkholderia) and g-Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas) (Eltis and Bolin, 1996). I.2.C EDO genes were
found in all three of our metagenomic fosmid clones
(3F10, 9C3 and 7D12).
The pTDN1-specified genes in the aniline-degrading meta-cleavage pathway constitute the operon
tdnD1C(orf123)D2C2(orf4)EFGHIJKL (Fukumori and
Saint, 2001) (Figure 3). Most of the deduced proteins
encoded by ORF3F10-1 to 16 show extremely
high amino acid identity (494%) with these Tdn
proteins (Figures 1 and 3). As is the case for pTDN1,

ase (ORF3F10-2 and 6) and ferredoxin (ORF3F10-1
and 5).
The deduced amino acid sequences of ORF9C3-19
to 35 are 54–100% identical to those of proteins
encoded by pTDN1 (Figures 1 and 3). Unlike 3F10,
the 9C3 fosmid contains single copies of the genes
for catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and ferredoxin. To
examine the activities of the ORF9C3-28 to 35
gene products, the gene cluster was subcloned into
pUC18. E. coli JM109 cells carrying the recombinant
plasmid produced 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde

containing aniline, confirming the activities of
aniline dioxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase.
The aniline-catabolizing gene cluster on pTDN1 is
flanked by IS1071 (Fukumori and Saint, 2001).
IS1071 is preferentially located on broad host-range
IncP-1b plasmids and can transpose in b-proteobacterial strains with high frequency (Sota et al.,
2006b). Downstream of the degradation gene cluster
on 9C3, two truncated IS1071 transposase genes
(ORF9C3-3 and 14) flank a complete set of
mercury-resistance genes, merRTPCADE (ORF9C34 to 10) (Figure 1). Because IncP-1b plasmids often
carry mercury-resistance genes flanked by IS1071,
the insert in 9C3 might have originated from an
IncP-1b plasmid of b-proteobacterial origin, which is
consistent with the SOM analysis result.
Four fosmids (7D12, 4E8, 6H11 and 9E5) had
overlapping sequences (Figure1 and Supplementary
Figure S1). The deduced products of ORF7D12-39
to 44 show amino acid sequence identities of
71–83% with those of OrfX (unknown function),
AphB (2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase), AphQ
(unknown function), AphP (reductase component of
phenol hydroxylase), AphO (hydroxylase component of phenol hydroxylase) and AphN (hydroxylase component of phenol hydroxylase) of the
phenol-utilizing strain Comamonas testosteroni
TA441 (Arai et al., 2000); these levels of identity
are higher than those found for the DmpOPQB
products of pVI150, which exhibit only 33–58%
identity with these proteins.
Fosmid 7D12 contained two genes for ribosomal
proteins, L13 (RplM, ORF7D12-15) and S9 (RpsI,
ORF7D12-16); L13 and S9 are 90% and 87%
identical, respectively, to a ribosomal protein of
Acidvorax sp. JS42, indicating that this DNA

fragment must have originated from a b-proteobacterial chromosome (Figure 1). ORF7D12-17, a putative gene (int) for tyrosine recombinase-type
integrase that has highly conserved functional
homologs in the Tn4371-like genomic islands
(Toussaint et al., 2003), was located downstream of
rplM. Likewise, the deduced amino acid sequences
of the ORF7D12-26, 34, 35 and 38 gene
products show 90% identity with those of ParB,
RepA, ParA and TraF, respectively, of the Tn4371like islands. Furthermore, a conserved target site (50 TTTTCAT-30 ) for Tn4371 insertion was found in the
intergenic region between the rplM and int genes,
which might constitute one end of the Tn4371-like
genomic islands. Therefore, the 22-kb region downstream of rplM is likely to be part of a Tn4371-like
genomic island that contains the aph operon.
Fosmids carrying I.1.C and I.3.M EDO genes. We
recently proposed the I.1.C and I.3.M EDO subfamilies on the basis of their novel amino acid sequences
(Suenaga et al., 2007). A DNA fragment containing
the I.1.C EDO gene was found in both fosmids 4A3
and 6B9, and a fragment containing the I.3.M EDO
gene was found in both 7E11 and 8C3 (Figure 1 and
Supplementary Figure S2). Strikingly, degradation
genes other than these EDO genes were not
identified in the fosmid inserts. ORF7E11-1, 2
and 3 appear to constitute an operon with the
I.3.M EDO gene (ORF7E11-4). The former three
genes were annotated as the genes for a hypothetical
protein, hydantoin racemase and fumarate reductase
flavoprotein subunit, respectively, but functions
of these ORFs for the degradation of aromatic
compounds remain unclear. Although there are
some examples of functionally related catabolic

genes being dispersed on chromosomes and
plasmids (for example, Rhodococcus spp. and
sphingomonads) (van der Geize and Dijkhuizen,
2004; Basta et al., 2005), the ‘solitary’-type gene
structure identified in these fosmids has not
previously been documented.

Table 3 Structural diversity of three sequential genes (phenol
hydroxylase, EDO, and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase) in fosmid inserts containing I.2.G subfamily EDO genes

Fosmids carrying I.3.N EDO genes. The EDO
(ORF1F2-17 product) encoded by fosmid 1F2 belongs to the novel subfamily I.3.N (Suenaga et al.,
2007). Sixteen genes (ORF1F2-3 to 7 and 16 to
26) in the fosmid were categorized as involved in
aromatics degradation (Figures 1 and 4). Of these 16
genes, nine (ORF1F2-7, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23 to
26) encoded products predicted to have 27–53%
amino acid sequence identity with those of the
enzymes for naphthalene degradation encoded by
the nah genes of plasmid NAH7 from P. putida G7
(Sota et al., 2006a) and the nag genes of Ralstonia sp.
U2 (Zhou et al., 2001). However, these 16 genes are
apparently not sufficient to constitute a complete
pathway for naphthalene degradation (Figure 4).
Although the EDO sequence of ORF1F2-17 is only
19% identical to that of NAH7-encoded NahH
(catechol 2,3-dioxygenase), the ORF1F2-17 gene
product actually cleaves catechol at the metaposition (Suenaga et al., 2007). Thus, the ORF1F216 to 26 products seem to constitute a nah-nag
chimeric pathway for degradation of salicylate
(compound 8 in Figure 4). E. coli EPI300 cells
carrying the 1F2 fosmid grown in LB medium
containing chloramphenicol were able to transform
phenol, but not naphthalene, to its meta-cleavage
yellow product. Despite these experimental results,
no 1F2 fosmid genes were found to be homologs of
known genes for phenol hydroxylase or its components. Therefore, the fosmid appears to contain
novel phenol hydroxylase genes; the candidate
genes are ORF1F2-3 (4-hydroxybenzoate 3-monoxygenase), ORF1F2-4 (ferredoxin), ORF1F2-5 (aromatic
compound dioxygenase), ORF1F2-18 (reductase) and
ORF1F2-19 (hydroxylase).

Fosmids carrying I.2.G EDO genes. In the 38
fosmids, genes of the novel I.2.G EDO subfamily
were overrepresented, constituting 18 clones
(Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S3). (The
complete sequences of functional EDO genes in the
3G3 fosmid were not obtained because of failure
during contig assembly.) This dominance of the
I.2.G subfamily suggests that this type of novel EDO
may have an important role in our target environment (that is, coke plant wastewater habitat). All of
the 18 fosmids (except for 3G3) carried a set of three
genes encoding single-component-type phenol hydroxylase, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase, in that order
(Table 3). The 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde
hydrolase genes on these fosmids were apparently
either intact or truncated at the 30 -end. The fosmids

semialdehyde hydrolase gene tended to carry an
additional homologous copy downstream. Such
genes, for example, ORF2C1-27 and 29 in fosmid
2C1, were 59% identical to each other in nucleotide
sequence and their respective products were 38%
and 41% identical, respectively, in amino acid
sequence to 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase (encoded by pheC) from the phenol-utilizing
B. thermoglucosidasius strain A7 (Duffner et al.,
2000) (Figure 5).
All of the phenol hydroxylase genes upstream of
the I.2.G EDO genes are very similar to one another,
and their deduced products are 46% identical to
PheA from B. stearothermophilus BR219, the only
known single-component-type phenol hydroxylase
(Kim and Oriel, 1995) (Figures 1 and 5). Fosmid 2C1
is different from the other 17 fosmids in that it
additionally contains two putative genes for phenol
hydroxylases. These genes (ORF2C1-33 and 32) are
arranged in a tail-to-tail configuration, and their
deduced products are 48 and 37% identical to PheA
and PheB, respectively, from B. thermoglucosidasius
A7 (Figures 1 and 5).
To examine the functions of these putative phenol
hydroxylase genes, each DNA region containing
the phenol hydroxylase and EDO genes was subcloned into pUC18. JM109 cells, separately carrying
each of the 17 resulting plasmids, produced a yellow
product on LB agar in the presence of catechol
(Table 3), confirming catechol 2,3-dioxygenase

activities. In addition, 12 of the 17 clones produced
2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (yellow) on LB
agar plates containing phenol. These active clones
contain the genes for functional single-component
phenol hydroxylases. Frame-shift (2C1, 4E12), nonsense (2A1), or substitution (2B9, 5B2) mutations in
the remaining, inactive genes might have caused the
loss or alteration of enzymatic activity (Table 3).
Fosmids carrying the I.2.G EDO genes were
characterized by a relative abundance in mobile
genetic elements and their remnants. It is also
noteworthy that the transposase genes for ISPme1
(in 1D9 to 7B2; see below section ‘Reconstitution of
a plasmid-like circular DNA from fosmid sequences
carrying I.2.G EDO genes’) and an ISSop9-related
element (ORF2B9-5, ORF2A1-27 and ORF2C1-24)
were located very close to the single-component
phenol hydroxylase genes (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S3). The fosmid 3G3 contains at
least 10 genes predicted to be involved in the type IV
conjugative transfer system: the gene for the coupling protein (TraG) and for the mating-pair formation apparatus (Trb) (Figure 1 and Supplementary
Figure S3). The organization of these genes
(trbBCDEJLFGI) in 3G3 resembles that found in the
Tn4371 genomic island (Toussaint et al., 2003)
rather than that found in self-transmissible plasmids
(Schröder and Lanka, 2005). These genes exhibit
B60% identity to those of typical Tn4371-type
genomic islands (Toussaint et al., 2003) and much
higher (B90%) identities to those found on the
second chromosome of the a-proteobacterial strain
Ochrobactrum anthropi ATCC 49188. Therefore, the
transfer-related gene cluster in 3G3 appears to be
part of a variant Tn4371-type genomic island in
which several a-proteobacterial genomes also reside.
The deduced gene products of ORF2A1-17, 16
and 15 share 96%, 89% and 44% identity,
respectively, with the replication proteins RepA
(ZP_01441940), RepB (ZP_01441941) and RepC
(ZP_01038470) of Roseovarius sp. strains HTCC2601
(RepA and B) and 217 (RepC). This type of repABC
operon controls stable replication and partitioning
of large and low-copy-number plasmids and has
been found only in a-Proteobacteria (Cevallos et al.,
2008). Therefore, the 2A1 insert appears to originate
from an a-proteobacterial plasmid, consistent with
the result of SOM analysis.
Reconstitution of a plasmid-like circular DNA from
fosmid sequences carrying I.2.G EDO genes

The fosmid fragments in 1D9, 1D2, 9B9, 3H5, 1H11
and 6D4 had overlapping sequences that were
assembled into a 36 684-bp circular DNA form
(Figure 6). This circular DNA, designated pSKYE1,
contained a total of 34 ORFs and was considered to
be a plasmid because of the observations described
below.
The circular DNA pSKYE1 carries several genes
related to plasmid replication (ORF1D9-5), partition

in silico. The ORF numbers are those used for the fosmid 1D9
insert. Predicted ORF functions are shown according to color as
in Figure 1.

(ORF1D9-12, and 29), and conjugation (ORF1D9-1,
14 and 31). The deduced gene product of
ORF1D9-5 is 82% identical to RepA of plasmid
pAMI2 of Paracoccus aminophilus JCM 7686, which
has a replication system that is functional in several
a-proteobacterial genera, such as Paracoccus,
Rhizobium, Rhodobacter and Agrobacterium (Dziewit et al., 2007). Therefore, replication of pSKYE1
might be possible in a-proteobacterial strains. The
repA gene of pAMI2 is followed by a so-called PAR
module, which is responsible for the active partitioning function of the plasmid (Dziewit et al.,
2007). Furthermore, pSKYE1 carries two putative
partition gene modules (ORF1D9-12 and 13 and
ORF1D2-29 and 30). The deduced gene products
lack homology to the PAR modules in pAMI2.
However, the deduced ORF1D9-12 and 13 gene
products are 66% and 44% identical to the corresponding gene products encoded by Laribacter
hongkongensis plasmid pHLHK22, and the deduced
ORF1D2-29 and ORF1D9-30 gene products are 44%
and 29% identical to the corresponding proteins
encoded by a large plasmid from Pseudomonas
syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A. The deduced
products of ORF1D9-1 and 14 are 70% and 87%
identical to the C-terminal regions of the conjugative
transfer TraG proteins of plasmid Ti from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (NP_059692) and plasmid
pAgK84 from A. tumefaciens K84 (YP_086775),
respectively, and the deduced ORF1D9-31 product
is 51% identical to an intact conjugal transfer antirestriction protein of Nitrobacter hamburgenis X14
(YP_575924).
An IS element and transposon were found in
pSKYE1; their putative terminal inverted-repeat (IR)
sequences are shown in Supplementary Figure S4.

IR sequences is located very close to the singlecomponent phenol hydroxylase gene and was
thought to be ISPme1, an IS element from plasmid
pMTH1 of Paracoccus methylutens DM12 (Bartosik
et al., 2008). The latter element, designated Tn6032,
has 25-bp IR sequences and carries three ORFs
encoding polypeptides with moderate sequence
identity to TniA (40%), TniB (35%) and an Nterminal portion of TniQ (23%) of Tn5053 from
Xanthomonas sp. W17 (Kholodii et al., 1995).
However, the IR sequences of Tn6032 are very
different from those of Tn5053 and its related
transposons, Tn402, Tn5468 and Tn7 (Oppon
et al., 1998; Minakhina et al., 1999). Furthermore,
the resolvase gene in Tn5053 was not found in
Tn6032. The 3.8-kb region containing ORF28 and
ORF29 shows 90% nucleotide sequence identity to
the corresponding region of the 3.8-kb Tn3-family
transposon ISTB11 on IncP-1a plasmid pTB11,
which was exogenously isolated from a wastewater
plant in Germany (Tennstedt et al., 2005). The
nucleotide sequence of ISTB11 is distinct from that
of other Tn3-family transposons, and its isoforms
have not yet been discovered.
With respect to the genes involved in aromatic
compound degradation, pSKYE1 contains only two
genes for phenol hydroxylase and EDO. This
situation is very different from that of known
bacterial catabolic plasmids, which are usually large
(450 kb) and carry operonic degradative gene
clusters (van der Meer et al., 1992; Dennis, 2005).
Because of their great lipophilicity and their ability
to produce reactive oxygen species, phenol and
catechol are potentially toxic to bacterial cells
(Benndorf et al., 2001). Wastewater from coke plants
contains various organic pollutants, including phenol and mono- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Stamoudis and Luthy, 1980). Therefore,
pSKYE1, which carries a ‘detoxification apparatus’
for aromatic compounds, is likely to provide a
survival advantage to its host cells in this harsh
environment. The same environment might host
bacterial strains that cannot degrade aromatic
compounds by themselves. These bacteria may be
fortunate in having this ‘detoxification apparatus’
functioning in their environment.

Conclusions
In our previous study (Suenaga et al., 2007), we used
a fosmid vector to clone environmental (that is,
activated sludge) DNA fragments of 30–40 kb. These
fragments were thought to be suitable for cloning
large DNA fragments containing common aromatic
compound degradation genes. In this study, we
obtained various new insights into the distribution
and organization of aromatics degradation genes in
the activated sludge microbial community by analyzing the sequences of 38 selected clones. A major
finding was that the complete pathways generally
The ISME Journal

recognized as ‘standard’ in previous studies are
extremely rare. Only two complete degradation
pathways similar to dmp and tdn gene clusters were
identified. Instead, various types of gene subsets
were identified that were not similar to previously
reported ‘upper’ or ‘lower’ pathway modules, suggesting that aromatic compounds in the sampled
natural environment are degraded through the
concerted actions of various fragmental pathways.
Strikingly, a small piece of the aromatics degradation pathway consisting of single-component type
phenol hydroxylase and EDO was overrepresented.
Taking into account the fact that this module is
found on our plasmid-like circular DNA form
pSKYE1, we conclude that pSKYE1 has a crucial
role in the detoxification of aromatic compounds in
our target environment. All of these findings were
obtained from the analysis of nucleotides only
1.5 Mb in length. Thus, sequence analysis of
metagenomes showing specific functions is extremely useful in uncovering novel findings concerning targeted biological functions and their
evolutionary stages across a wide range of bacterial
strains.
