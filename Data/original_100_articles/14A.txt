Polyphasic microbial community analysis of petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soils from two northern Canadian communities

Abstract

The cold-adapted bacterial communities in petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated and non-impacted soils from two northern Canadian environments, Kuujjuaq, Que., and Alert, Nunavut, were analyzed using a polyphasic approach. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) separation of 16S rDNA PCR fragments from soil total community DNA revealed a high level of bacterial diversity, as estimated by the total number of bands visualized. Dendrogram analysis clustered the sample sites on the basis of geographical location. Comparison of the overall microbial molecular diversity suggested that in the Kuujjuaq sites, contamination negatively impacted diversity whereas in the Alert samples, diversity was maintained or increased as compared to uncontaminated controls. Extraction and sequencing analysis of selected 16S rDNA bands demonstrated a range of similarity of 86–100% to reference organisms, with 63.6% of the bands representing high G+C Gram-positive organisms in the order Actinomycetales and 36.4% in the class Proteobacteria. Community level physiological profiles generated using Biolog GN plates were analyzed by cluster analysis. Based on substrate oxidation rates, the samples clustered into groups similar to those of the DGGE dendrograms, i.e. separation based upon geographic origin. The coinciding results reached using culture-independent and -dependent analyses reinforces the conclusion that geographical origin of the samples, rather than petroleum contamination level, was more important in determining species diversity within these cold-adapted bacterial communities.
1Introduction

The expansion of human settlements to remote areas of the globe brings with it potential pollution problems. In the Canadian north, a large source of environmental contamination results from oil exploration and the spillage during transfer of petroleum hydrocarbons needed to generate heat and electricity. Temperature is one of the most important factors influencing the metabolic activity of microorganisms [1], directly affecting rates of degradation in polar regions. Several groups have observed that petroleum hydrocarbons can be biodegraded in cold environments [2–6], and that the application of oil to previously uncontaminated soil results in an increase in total bacterial numbers under near Arctic conditions [7,8], and cold climate regions of the southern hemisphere [9].

Estimates of microbial diversity within an environment can be divided into two broad categories, culture-dependent or -independent methods. Analysis of total community nucleic acids extracted from an environment using culture-independent methods permits the detection and phylogenetic identification of fastidious or as yet uncultured organisms. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) separation of 16S rDNA amplification products has been largely responsible for the description of many environments at the molecular level [10–12]. The total number of bands visualized in a DGGE gel also provides an estimate of the genetic diversity found within a given environment [10], and sequencing of selected DGGE bands enables phylogenetic relationships to be inferred [11,12]. The assignment of a metabolic capacity to a particular band from a DGGE gel, as inferred from phylogenetic analysis, has been postulated, although this remains to be demonstrated [13,14].

Culture-dependent techniques, such as Biolog-generated community level physiological profiles (CLPP) [15], have been used to estimate the ex situ metabolic potential of members of the microbial community from a variety of environments (see review by Konopka et al. [16]). CLPP provides an indication of the metabolic diversity present in an environment with respect to the number of defined substrates that can be oxidized [15]. Recent studies have suggested that the faster growing species, such as the pseudomonads, produce the generated patterns, and not the numerically dominant members of the microbial community [16,17].

The combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches in the analysis of an environment may result in a more detailed description of the experimental system. Biolog analysis combined with either enterobacterial repetitive intergenic PCR [18] or DGGE separation of 16S rRNA amplification products [19] was used to monitor soil microbial community responses to different alfalfa strains and to the application of urea herbicides, respectively. In both studies, consistent differences between control and test systems were identified with the culture-dependent and -independent techniques.

In this study, a similar approach combining culture-dependent and -independent techniques was used to evaluate the cold-adapted microbial population differences of soils impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons originating from two different communities in northern Canada. CLPP analysis of the soil microbial communities and DGGE analysis of 16S rDNA amplification products from total community DNA demonstrated that geographical separation between the two communities and differences in the location of sampling sites were more important than the petroleum hydrocarbon contamination levels in describing the microbial diversity.
2Materials and methods

2.1Soils

A total of eight samples, four each from Kuujjuaq, Que. (58°06 N) and from Alert, Nunavut (82°30 N) were taken in July, 1997. The Kuujjuaq samples (labeled K1, K2, K3, and K4) and the Alert samples (labeled Ac, A1, A2, and A3, which are equivalent to Pristine, I.D. #1, I.D. #2, and I.D. #4, respectively, in Whyte et al. [6]), were sampled from just below the surface to a depth of approximately 10 cm, sealed in plastic bags and transported on ice to the lab, where they were kept at 4°C until analyzed. Contaminated samples contained petroleum hydrocarbons originating from jet and/or diesel fuel spills. Total viable bacteria in the samples were enumerated after 2 weeks growth at 5°C, on mineral salts medium [20] containing 250 mg l−1 each of yeast extract, tryptone, and starch.
2.2DGGE analysis of total community DNA

Total DNA was extracted and purified using a beadbeater method and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) spin columns according to Berthelet et al. [21]. A region of approximately 500 bp from the 16S rDNA gene (341–758, Escherichia coli numbering [22]) was amplified using the primers b341GC (5′-CGCCCGCCGCGCGCGGCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGGCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) [23] and b758 (5′-CTACCAGGGTATCTAATCC-3′) [24,25] which are specific for almost all eubacterial 16S rDNA sequences. The italicized sequence in b341GC indicates the GC clamp required for DGGE analysis. Each 200 μl PCR mixture contained 4 μl of PVPP column-cleaned soil DNA extracts, 25 pmol of each primer, 200 μM of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, and 1 mM MgCl2. The tubes were placed into a Perkin Elmer-Cetus thermal cycler 480 (Perkin Elmer-Cetus, Mississauga, Ont., Canada) and heated to 96°C for 5 min. The temperature was then brought down to 80°C and 10 U Taq DNA polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfé, Que., Canada) in 20 μl of 10×PCR buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 9.0), 500 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2) was added. Touchdown PCR, essentially as described by Rölleke et al. [23], was used to reduce non-specific fragment amplification [10,26] with the following modification: 20 cycles were performed at the final annealing temperature of 55°C. Amplification products were analyzed on 1.2% agarose gels followed by ethidium bromide staining to determine if the amplification was successful. PCR products were prepared for DGGE analysis as described by Teske et al. [27] with the following modifications: precipitation was performed at −20°C and the final pellet was resuspended in 10 μl dH2O and 4 μl of 6×loading buffer III [28].

DGGE was performed using a Bio-Rad DCode system (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ont., Canada), as described by the manufacturer. An 8% acrylamide gel with a 40–60% denaturant gradient was used (where 100% denaturant contained 7 M urea and 40% deionized formamide) and electrophoresis was performed at 60°C and 90 V for 16 h. The gels were then stained with ethidium bromide, destained in dH2O, and photographed.
2.3DGGE fragment isolation and sequencing

DNA fragments from the DGGE were isolated as described by Rölleke et al. [23] and then re-amplified under the following conditions: 50 μl PCR mixture containing 3 μl of precipitated DGGE band, 25 pmol of each primer (b341 [underlined sequence in b341GC] and b758), 200 μM of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, and 1 mM MgCl2, overlaid with mineral oil, and heated for 5 min at 96°C in the thermal cycler. The temperature was then brought down to 80°C and 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase in 5 μl 10×PCR buffer was added. The cycling conditions were 1 min at 94°C, 30 s at 60°C, and 30 s at 72°C for 30 cycles. The single re-amplified bands were then purified using the QIAQuick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ont., Canada).

Sequencing of the re-amplified fragments was performed using the ABI Prism dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Perkin Elmer, Montreal, Que., Canada) and the ABI Prism 377 automated fluorescence sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) as specified by the manufacturers. Sequences were submitted for comparison to the GenBank databases using the BLAST algorithm [29], the EMBL databases using the FASTA algorithm [30], or the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) [31] using Sequence Match. Sequences which demonstrated strong similarity were then aligned to reference sequences using the Geneworks II software (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, CA, USA). The PHYLIP package [32] was used to generate phylogenetic trees. Distance matrices were produced using the DNADIST program and unrooted phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method of Felsenstein [32] in the NEIGHBOR program. Bootstrapping with the SEQBOOT program was then employed to determine the statistical significance of the groupings. Sequences which demonstrated uncertain alignments were checked for chimeras using the Chimera function at the RDP site. Sequences were submitted to GenBank and assigned accession numbers AF143747–AF143770.

Dendrogram analysis of DGGE banding patterns was performed using the Dendron 2.2 software package (Solltech Inc., Oakdale, LA, USA). The dendrogram was created using unweighted pair groupings of a similarity coefficient (SAB) matrix. The stability of the resulting dendrogram was tested by randomizing the sample order 100 times and recalculating the dendrogram with 95% background noise.
2.4CLPP analysis

Ten-fold dilutions used for bacterial enumeration were used to inoculate Biolog GN plates (150 μl per well) and incubated at 10°C. The plates were read every 12 h (OD590) for the first 48 h, and then readings were taken every 24 h for the remainder of the incubation. All wells were blanked to the water control well A1. The rate of substrate oxidation by each sample for individual carbon sources was calculated as the first linear portion of the plotted curve change in OD590 over time [33]. Rates were analyzed by cluster analysis using the statistical program Minitab (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA).

3.1Site characterization

Chemical analysis of the samples (Table 1) revealed that the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) contamination levels varied from <100–200 ppm (uncontaminated sites) to 26 900 ppm (heavily contaminated). Samples from Alert, which were contaminated primarily by jet and diesel fuels, possessed similar total carbon and total nitrogen levels, despite the large range of petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations present at the sites. The total carbon and total nitrogen values from the Kuujjuaq sites differed significantly between the K1 and K2 sites and the K3 and K4 sites. The K1 and K2 samples came from a sandy area contaminated with jet fuel whereas the K3 and K4 samples originated from adjacent non-impacted areas. Despite the contamination of the K1 and K2 samples, the total carbon measured was still 10–15 times lower than in the K3 and K4 samples. The total nitrogen in the samples was also 10-fold lower in the K1 and K2 soils than in the K3 and K4 soils. The ratio of total carbon to total nitrogen (C:N) in the Kuujjuaq samples were all very similar (22.1–31.0) suggesting a balanced C:N ratio. The Alert samples by contrast were somewhat nitrogen-deficient based on the observed C:N ratios (50.5–214.0).

To provide an indication of the relative abundance of total heterotrophic cold-adapted microorganisms present in each soil, a viable plate count was performed on nutrient-limited medium. The culturable counts, determined at 5°C, ranged from 106 to 108 CFU g soil−1 (Table 1). The levels of contamination present at the Alert and Kuujjuaq sites did not negatively affect the viable microbial population levels. Differences within the Kuujjuaq samples were only one order of magnitude (106–107), with the highest counts originating from sample K1 (600 ppm TPH). The uncontaminated Alert sites Ac and A2 demonstrated one to two orders of magnitude lower total heterotroph counts (106–107) versus the contaminated sites A3 and A1 (107–108).
3.2DGGE analysis

The expected 500-bp PCR product specified by the bacterial 16S rDNA primers was amplified in all of the soils. Separation of these fragments by DGGE produced distinct and reproducible patterns comprising 20–35 distinct bands for each of the soil samples (Fig. 1). Several of the observed bands appeared to be shared between samples, but the majority were unique for each sample site. Bands which were clearly separated from neighboring bands and were easily visualized were isolated for sequencing (Fig. 1). Sequences of 300–450 bp were obtained from all of the isolated bands. The highest similarity for each of the 22 sequenced bands, obtained by BLAST and FASTA comparisons, is shown in Table 2. The range of similarity to reference sequences contained in the databases was 86.1% (A11) to 100.0% (A2). The majority of the isolated bands were sequenced with relative ease and minimal background interference, suggesting that each band represented a unique microorganism. Several isolated bands were not amenable to sequencing due to high levels of background in the sequencing reaction. This result suggests that these bands were actually composites, made up of two or more distinct sequences which possess similar electrophoretic mobility under the conditions used for DGGE [10,23]. Assuming that several of the bands visualized in each sample are composites of distinct 16S rDNA fragments originating from different bacterial species, the bacterial diversity of the samples, as estimated by the total number of discernible bands in the DGGE gels for each site, is underestimated.

Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences (Fig. 2) revealed that the bacterial diversity present in the different soils was broad, being distributed between the Actinomycetales (63.6%) [34] and Proteobacteria (36.4%) [24]. Within each of these groups, the distribution was also widespread. Within the Actinomycetales, 33.3% of the sequences belonged to the Micrococcineae suborder, and included, in part, the genera Arthrobacter, Cellulomonas, and Clavibacter. The second largest group was formed by the Nocardioidaceae (25%). There was a single sequence found within the Corynebacterineae, which was positioned between the genera Rhodococcus and Williamsia.

All of the sequences grouped into either the high G+C Gram-positives or Gram-negative Proteobacteria. DGGE bands are designated as shown in Fig. 1 and reference sequences used are shown with their respective GenBank accession numbers. Bar, sequence dissimilarity.
Within the Proteobacteria, the γ subdivision was predominant (62.5%), composed in part by the genera Xanthomonas, Halomonas, and Methylobacter. The α subdivision comprised 25% of the Proteobacteria observed, and included the genera Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, and Erythrobacter. Two other sequences (K6A and K11) possessed significant sequence similarity to the δ subdivision genera Geobacter and Pelobacter. Sequence A11 was the only sequence to show similarity to the β group, although it was somewhat distant at only 86%.

Several of the sequences possessed significant similarity to one another. Within the γ subdivision of the Proteobacteria, grouping with Xanthomonas, sequences A4, A5, and A14 showed approximately 97% similarity to one another, with A4 and A14 differing by only three nucleotides. In the group of sequences clustering with Arthrobacter (A2, K2, K3, K5 and K6), similarity of the complete cluster was greater than 95%. Nucleotide comparison within this cluster revealed that no two sequences were less than 97% homologous. There were two distinct groups within the Nocardioides cluster: A13 and A16, and A9, A18, and A19 which demonstrated similarity within the cluster of almost 100% and greater than 93%, respectively. Although both of these groupings showed the strongest matches to Nocardioides, there was a notable difference between the two clusters in the form of a 10-bp deletion in the A13–A16 grouping.

The two sequences A11 and K11 demonstrated similarity to the β and δ subdivisions of the Proteobacteria, respectively. Construction of phylogenetic trees consistently grouped these two sequences near the node of their respective branches, suggesting that they possessed only a distant relationship to other members of their group and may represent novel cold-adapted microorganisms.
3.3Dendrogram analysis of DGGE

Banding patterns generated by DGGE for each site were used for cluster analysis and the creation of a dendrogram (Fig. 3). Stability of the dendrogram was tested (as described in Section 2), and consistently resulted in the groupings shown in Fig. 3. Sample sites divided into two clusters based on their geographic origin, i.e. Alert and Kuujjuaq. The Kuujjuaq samples were clustered amongst themselves based upon contamination level: K3 and K4 came from nearby tundra areas uncontaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons, whereas K1 and K2 came from contaminated areas adjacent to the refueling station. The Alert samples grouped together in a slightly different fashion. The Ac (uncontaminated) and A1 (heavily contaminated) soils clustered together within the Alert grouping. The A2 and A3 sites (uncontaminated and moderately contaminated, respectively) were grouped at an intermediate position between the other Alert samples and the Kuujjuaq sample cluster K3 and K4.

3.4CLPP analysis

The metabolic diversity of the cold-adapted soil microbial communities was estimated by the total number of substrates oxidized in the Biolog GN plates at 10°C. The samples divided into four groups (number of substrates oxidized out of 95 shown in parentheses): A2 (87) and A3 (86); Ac (61), K1 (66), and K3 (70); K4 (46) and K2 (49); and A1 (26). There was no observable pattern in the groupings with respect to geographic origin of the samples, contamination levels, or any of the other measured parameters.

The rate of oxidation of each substrate was calculated (data not shown) and similarity between samples was assessed using cluster analysis. Dendrograms created using both squared Euclidean and Manhattan similarity indices generated identical groupings (Fig. 4) which were very similar to those of the DGGE dendrograms, i.e. clustering based upon geographic origin of the samples. Sample divisions within the two clusters could not be described by any of the measured parameters including contamination level and total carbon or nitrogen levels.

Sample A1 demonstrated a reduced ability to oxidize the Biolog GN substrates with respect to both the total number and the rates at which oxidation occurred. A1 was also the most severely contaminated sample at 26 900 ppm TPH.
4Discussion

The soils examined in this study represent two different northern Canadian communities, both subjected to relatively long-term petroleum hydrocarbon contamination. The total heterotrophic cold-adapted population, determined at 5°C, ranged from 106 to 108 CFU g soil−1 (Table 1). These values are comparable to results obtained from other petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated sites in the far north, such as Baffin Island (105) [21] and Alaska (105–107) [35]. Previous studies have documented an increase in the hydrocarbon-degrading population after contamination [6,36,37]. Although changes in the total hydrocarbon-tolerant/degrading population were not measured in this study, a similar increase in the total heterotrophic population was observed at the contaminated Alert and Kuujjuaq sites.

The bacterial molecular diversity in the soil samples was estimated by the number of amplified 16S rDNA bands following DGGE separation, as performed by Muyzer et al. [10]. Each band was assumed to represent a single operational taxonomic unit [38]. Several interesting differences between the Alert and Kuujjuaq sites were noted. Banding patterns within the Kuujjuaq sites could be grouped into two categories, K1–K2 (contaminated) and K3–K4 (uncontaminated). Kuujjuaq samples K1 and K2 displayed a moderate number of bands, whereas samples K3 and K4 produced a greater number of distinct bands, all of equal intensity. This difference in the number of bands suggests that the microbial community within the contaminated samples K1 and K2 underwent a decrease in species diversity as members of the bacterial population were subjected to selective enrichment. The apparent decrease in diversity of a microbial community following contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons has also been observed by others [39–42]. The greater number of bands observed in the K3 and K4 samples suggested a greater diversity in the bacterial species present. The relatively equal intensities of the bands within the K3 and K4 samples is interesting, although the importance of band intensity remains to be determined.

The response of the Alert microbial communities to hydrocarbon contamination, as observed using DGGE, appeared to be different from that of the Kuujjuaq sites. Samples A2 (uncontaminated) and A3 (contaminated) produced very similar patterns with respect to the number of bands visualized, yet contamination levels were significantly different. A1, the most heavily contaminated sample, produced a similar number of bands as the uncontaminated site Ac, yet both of these produced significantly fewer bands than either A2 or A3. These results do not follow the observed decrease in species diversity following contamination, as in the Kuujjuaq samples or by other groups [39–42]. In the case of A3, it appears that molecular diversity is maintained or increased in comparison to the uncontaminated controls A2 and Ac, respectively. Similar observations of stable or increased microbial diversity after contamination have been noted by other researchers [37,43]. Alert, due to its latitude, has fewer plant species, which would limit the variety and complexity of plant-derived organic substrates for indigenous bacteria. Following contamination at Alert, the number and variety of potential carbon substrates increased, resulting in an increase in bacterial activity, which could ultimately increase bacterial diversity. Local environmental and physico-chemical conditions would also play a role in the selective enrichment of the bacterial population [37,39]. Kuujjuaq experiences above freezing temperatures at least 4 months of the year, whereas Alert is characterized by extremely cold temperatures with only 6–8 weeks per year at, or above, the freezing point.

Sequencing of selected bands isolated from the DGGE gels revealed a broad spectrum of microorganisms. The majority of sequences (greater than 63%) represented high G+C Gram-positive organisms from the Actinomycetales. Many organisms able to degrade petroleum hydrocarbons are found in this group, including Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium, and Nocardia[44–46]. The examination of Siberian soils, using culturing [47] and molecular methods [48], identified the prevalence of the same groups of microorganisms, although some significant differences were noted. Many members of the low G+C Gram-positives were identified using culturing methods [47], whereas in this study, none of the sequenced bands showed similarity to members of the low G+C Gram-positive microorganisms. The percentages of isolated Gram-positive and Gram-negative culturable organisms isolated were 65.5% and 35.5%, respectively [47], which were almost identical to the values observed in this study, despite the difference in approaches, i.e. culture-dependent vs. -independent methods. In the study using molecular methods [48], Proteobacteria made up 60.5% of all sequenced clones, while Gram-positive microorganisms were less than 12%. None of the samples used in the Siberian studies were contaminated, suggesting that these surveys may represent typical bacterial populations found in tundra environments.

Comparison of the sequences obtained from bands K11 and A11 revealed 89% and 86% similarity, respectively, to reference sequences making it difficult to determine more than a general phylogenetic relationship. Sequence K11 consistently grouped with the δ Proteobacteria whereas sequence A11 grouped with the β Proteobacteria. Despite these consistent groupings, both of these sequences most likely represent two novel organisms within the class Proteobacteria.

Metabolic diversity of the cold-adapted microbial communities was estimated using Biolog GN plates incubated at 10°C. Clustering of the samples into four groups, based on the total number of substrates oxidized, suggested that the TPH levels were not consequential in influencing the overall metabolic diversity. All of these clusters possessed both uncontaminated and contaminated samples. None of the other measured physico-chemical parameters (see Table 1) provided an explanation for these divisions, suggesting that other environmental factors were important in influencing the metabolic diversity of the microbial communities. Cluster analysis, using the rates of oxidation for each substrate, suggested some unique relationships between the samples and the rates at which substrates were oxidized. Three of the four clusters on the dendrogram followed the trends observed in the total number of substrates oxidized. The three clusters included samples A2 and A3, K2 and K4, and K1 and K3. These groupings were not completely unexpected as cluster analysis of the rates of oxidation is also influenced by the total number of substrates oxidized. The most interesting cluster was the fourth one composed of samples A1 and Ac. These samples were grouped together based on rates of oxidation, yet the total number of substrates oxidized by each of the samples was significantly different (61 and 26 for Ac and A1, respectively). All of the clusters observed were also independent of the level of TPH contamination and were primarily based on the geographic origin of the samples, i.e. Alert samples grouped separately from the Kuujjuaq samples. A1 was the only sample to demonstrate a significant inhibition of metabolic activity, probably due to the level of TPH contamination. TPH contamination above 25 000 ppm has been shown to be inhibitory to soil microbial populations [49,50]. In addition, it was observed that despite several different treatment protocols, the rates and levels of hexadecane mineralization in soil A1 were markedly decreased compared with the moderately contaminated soil A3 [6].

In conclusion, the combination of culture-dependent and -independent methods to characterize the cold-adapted soil microbial population of two northern Canadian communities impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons suggests that the influence of contamination is only one of several factors that determine the selective pressures on indigenous microbial communities. The only trend consistently observed between the culture-dependent and -independent approaches, with respect to the level of microbial diversity, was that of a geographical separation between the Alert and Kuujjuaq samples. CLPP results were not able to differentiate samples based on level of contamination. In the Alert soils, hydrocarbon contamination increased the apparent microbial diversity, while in Kuujjuaq soils, the bacterial diversity was decreased. 16S rDNA sequencing of selected DGGE bands identified high G+C Gram-positive organisms belonging to the Actinomycetales as the predominant microorganisms, which are known to be important in the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons.
