Microbial diversity in four wells along a groundwater ¯owpath in a coal-tar-waste-contaminated
aquifer was examined using RFLP analysis of both 16S rDNA and naphthalene dioxygenase
(NDO) genes. Ampli®ed ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) relied upon eubacteriaspeci®c primers to generate four clone libraries. From each library, 100 clones were randomly
picked for analysis. Sixty percent of 400 clones contained unique ARDRA patterns. Diversity
indices calculated for each community were high (Shannon±Weaver, H0 = 3.53 to 3.69). Clones
representing ARDRA patterns found in the highest abundance were sequenced (31 total). Sequences related to aerobic bacteria (e.g., Nitrospira, Methylomonas, and Gallionella) predominated among those retrieved from the uncontaminated area of the site, whereas sequences
related to facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (e.g. Azoarcus, Syntrophus, and Desulfotomaculum) predominated among those retrieved from contaminated areas of the site. Using
NDO-speci®c primers and low-stringency PCR conditions, variability in RFLP patterns was only
detected in community-derived DNA (3 of 4 wells) and not in 5 newly isolated naphthalenedegrading pure cultures. The ARDRA patterns of the pure culture isolates were not found in the
clone libraries. Polymorphisms in community 16S rDNA and NDO genes found in well-water
microorganisms re¯ected distinctive geochemical conditions across the site. Sequences related to
sulfate-reducing bacteria were found in groundwater that contained sul®de, while sequences
related to Gallionella, Syntrophus, and nitrate-reducing aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were found in groundwater that contained ferrous iron, methane, and naphthalene,
respectively.

The composition of microbial communities re¯ects physical, chemical, geological, and biological characteristics of
their habitats. Thus, information about key community
members can be combined with knowledge of ecosystem

history to develop hypotheses about biogeochemical processes occurring in a given habitat. For example, the
composition of bacterial communities present in two deep
alkaline, anaerobic aquifers re¯ected the geochemical
signature of the groundwater [16]. Enriched numbers of
sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) indicated in situ oxidation
of organic carbon by SRB where concentrations of sulfate,
sul®de, and dissolved inorganic carbon (depleted in 13C)
were high [16]. Similarly, in situ reduction of 12CO2 by
autotrophic methanogens was inferred in strata containing
high numbers of methanogens, low concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and DIC enriched in 13C
[16]. More recently, anaerobic methane oxidation in the
marine habitat has been shown to involve a close association of SRB and methane-consuming methanogens by
stable isotopic analysis of cell components, ¯uorescent
in situ hybridization, and related sediment characteristics
[3, 30, 54], These examples demonstrate how geochemical
and microbiological evidence can be used to document in
situ biogeochemical processes.
The paradigm of using convergent lines of geochemical
and microbiological evidence to understand biogeochemical processes also applies to in situ metabolism of organic
pollutant compounds [4, 20, 31, 43, 51]. At a diesel-fuelcontaminated aquifer, intrinsic bioremediation was documented by isolating >106 aerobic and denitrifying
petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading organisms per gram;
identifying Azoarcus species among the isolates; con®rming the abundance of Azoarcus (1% of the community) by
hybridization; demonstrating petroleum hydrocarbon
degradation concomitant with electron acceptor loss in
microcosms; and measuring depleted oxygen and nitrate
and higher levels of dissolved inorganic carbon in the
contaminated area [31]. Another recent multidisciplinary
study of a petroleum±hydrocarbon contaminated aquifer
reported that Methanosaeta, an acetoclastic methanogen,
predominated where methane and DIC concentrations
rose [4]. Furthermore, in a BTEX-contaminated aquifer,
Geobacteracae, a family that includes iron-reducing benzene degraders, predominated in iron-reducing zones [60].
Current molecular methodologies for describing microbial communities (such as ampli®ed ribosomal DNA
restriction analysis (ARDRA), DGGE, and t-RFLP) [12, 15,
32, 50, 56] provide an approach to understanding therelationship between habitat geochemistry and native microorganisms. For example, phylogenetic studies of
microorganisms in acid mine drainage communities
identi®ed novel, uncultured organisms related to the

C. Bakermans, E.L. Madsen

iron-oxidizing groups ``Ferroplasma,'' Leptospirillum,
Sulfobacillus, and Acidimicrobium predominant in
low-pH, pyrite-rich environments [5, 6]. In addition, at a
jet-fuel- and chlorinated-solvent-contaminated aquifer
undergoing intrinsic bioremediation, ARDRA and sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of a diverse
microbial community dominated by Methanosaeta and
Syntrophus species, indicating that aceticlastic methanogenesis was the ®nal step in hydrocarbon degradation at
this site [11].
Bakermans et al. [1] presented data describing geochemical characteristics of a coal-tar-waste-contaminated
study site. In this parallel study, we present complementary information on the site's microbial community. The
microbial community in site well waters was characterized
by examining (1) naphthalene-degrading pure culture
isolates, (2) archetypal naphthalene dioxygenase (nahAc)
genes, and (3) community structure through ARDRA and
sequence analysis. Naphthalene dioxygenase sequence diversity was detected only in community extracted DNA,
not in pure culture isolates. ARDRA clone libraries were
highly diverse and contained a high number of unique
sequences for each groundwater sample examined.
Differences in the ARDRA-determined community compositions correlated strongly with anaerobic carbon and
energy ¯ow induced by the coal-tar waste.

Materials and Methods
Field Site and Groundwater Sampling
The site, located in South Glens Falls, NY, has been described
previously [43, 49, 66, 69, 72, 73]. Groundwater sampling techniques and locations are described in the accompanying article
[1].

Isolation of Naphthalene-Degrading Bacteria
from Groundwater
On site within 1 h of sampling, a dilution series of groundwater
was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (120 mM NaCl,
2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.6) and
plated onto Stanier's minimal salts (MSB) plates [65]. Plates were
incubated aerobically with exposure to naphthalene vapors at
10°C [33]. After 4 weeks of incubation, colonies were selected for
isolation and were puri®ed by multiple streaking of single colonies on MSB plus naphthalene plates. Naphthalene degradation
by isolates was veri®ed by mineralization of 14C-naphthalene
[41]. The previously described assay was used with the following
modi®cations. Cells were inoculated in 25-mL screw-cap vials
(Pierce, Rockland, IL) containing 3 mL LB (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L

16S rDNA, nahAc Diversity in Coal Tar Contaminated Aquifer
yeast extract, 10 g/L NaCl, pH 7.2). After incubation for 2 days at
room temperature with shaking at 150 rpm, 14C-naphthalene
(8628 dpm total) and salicylic acid (to 0.02%) were added to each
vial. Labeled naphthalene converted to 14CO2 was measured in a
scintillation counter (model 5000CE; Beckman Instruments,
Inc., Fullerton, CA) after 2 days and compared to negative (uninoculated) and positive (Pseudomonas putida NCIB 9816-4)
controls.

Sample Collection
Cells were concentrated from groundwater onto 0.22 lm pore
size, 142 mm diameter Durapore membranes (Millipore Corp.,
Bedford, MA). Approximately 5 L of water (17 min at 300 mL/
min) was ®ltered from each well (except MW8, from which approximately 3.5 L of water was ®ltered). Immediately following
concentration, ®lters were placed into sterile Whirlpak bags
(NASCO, Modesto, CA) and immersed in a dry ice/ethanol bath
for transport back to the laboratory where they were removed
and stored at )80°C.

Nucleic Acid Extraction
The extraction protocol developed by Wilson et al. [72] was used
through the ®rst precipitation step with the following modi®cations. Filter pieces were extracted a total of three times (once with
lysis buffer and twice with pH 8.0 buffer). Samples were extracted
with an equal volume of phenol equilibrated with pH 8.0 buffer,
followed by extraction with an equal volume of 1:1 phenol (pH
8.0): chloroform. Following overnight precipitation, nucleic acids
were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 ´ g and 4°C for 30 min.
Nucleic acid pellets were washed with 5 mL cold 70% ethanol and
recollected by centrifugation at 12,000 ´ g and 4°C for 5 min. The
supernatant was removed and the pellet dried by inverting the
tube in a sterile hood for 15 min. Pellets were resuspended in 1.4
mL TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA), incubated
overnight at 4°C, mixed by gentle pipetting, aliquoted into three
1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes, then reprecipitated by addition of
0.1 volumes 4 M sodium acetate pH 4.1, 1.5 lL 20 mg/mL glycogen, and 2 volumes 100% ethanol. The samples were incubated
overnight at )20°C and precipitated nucleic acids collected by
centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a benchtop microcentrifuge for
30 min. The supernatants were removed and the nucleic acid
pellet washed with 0.5 mL cold 70% ethanol. Pellets were dried by
inverting tubes in a sterile hood for 15 min, resuspended in 35 lL
buffer TE buffer, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and
mixed by gentle pipetting. The three aliquots of each sample were
recombined and stored at )20°C and represented approximately
5 ´ 106, 4 ´ 106, 5 ´ 106, and 1.5 ´ 105 cells/ll for MW36, MW8,
MW12, and MW4, respectively (based on acridine orange direct
counts).

PCR for nahAc
In a 200-lL thin-walled Eppendorf tube, 10 lL of extracted nucleic acids, 10 lL H2O inoculated with cells on the tip of a sterile

97
platinum inoculating needle, or 10 lL H2O (negative control) was
denatured for 5 min at 95°C. Following denaturation, samples
were mixed with reaction mix to a ®nal volume of 50 lL containing 1´ PCR Buffer (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 1 lM each of primers Ac114f (50 -CTGGCWWTTYCTCACYCAT-30 ) and Ac596r (50 -CRGGTGYCTTCCAGTTG-30 ) [72],
50 lM each dNTP, and 1 unit Taq DNA polymerase (Gibco BRL,
Gaithersburg, MD). PCR reactions were performed in a PTC-200
thermocycler (MJ Research Inc., Watertown, MA) as follows:
94°C for 5 min; 30 cycles consisting of 94°C for 30 sec, 43°C for
1 min, and 72°C for 1 min followed by 72°C for 5 min. The low
annealing temperature was used in an attempt to amplify more
diverse genes. Following PCR, 10 lL of each reaction was analyzed on a low-melting-point agarose gel. Because of the high
number of amplicons present, the expected 483-base-pair amplicon was excised for reampli®cation. The gel slices were melted
at 80°C for 10 min and diluted 1:1 with water to 10 lL for addition to the PCR tube.
Reampli®cation was performed as above except the annealing
temperature was raised to 55°C. The resulting amplicons were
digested with HaeIII or HhaI (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) by
adding 2 lL React II Buffer and 1 lL restriction endonuclease to
17 lL PCR reaction and incubating at 37°C for 3.5 h. To stop the
reaction, 4 lL of 6´ loading dye (15% Ficoll, 0.15% bromphenol
blue, 0.15% xylene cyanol FF) was added to each digest and
samples were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel.

Ampli®ed Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA)
PCR for eubacterial 16S rDNA genes from community DNA was
performed using primers 27f (50 -AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG30 ) and 1492r (50 -TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-30 ) [35] in
50-lL reactions that contained 1´ PCR Buffer (Gibco BRI), 3 mM
MgCl2, 40 nM of each primer, 0.40 mM of each deoxynucleoside
triphosphate (dNTPs), and 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Gibco
BRL) using the PTC-200 thermocycler as follows: 94°C for 5 min;
35 cycles consisting of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 1 min 72°C for 1
min followed by 72°C for 5 min. Extracted groundwater DNA
(2.75 lL) was used as template while 2.75 lL of sterile water was
used in negative controls. PCR products were ligated into the
vector pCR2.1 from the TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. After
transformation of plasmids into host cells and blue/white
screening of colonies, white colonies were picked from plates and
the presence of inserts veri®ed by PCR with primers 27f and
1492r. [Note: PCR with primers 27f and 1492r will also amplify
the Escherichia coli rDNA. False positives were seen in 11.7% of
the clones and were easily identi®ed during analysis of RFLP
patterns.] Digests and analyses were performed as described
above, except both HaeIII and HhaI were used in the same reaction. RFLP patterns were analyzed on 3% MetaPhor agarose
(BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, ME) gels with
100 base pair ladder (Gibco BRI) as marker. Fragment lengths
were determined and patterns compared using BIORAD Diversity Database 1.0 software package (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Her-

98
P
cules, CA). Shannon±Weaver index of diversity (H0 = ) ai ln ai,
where ai is the proportional abundance of the ith RFLP pattern
[52]) was calculated.

Sequencing of Clones and Sequence Analysis
Cultures were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking at 250 rpm
in 5 mL of LB and 100 lg/mL ampicillin in Falcon brand 17 ´ 100
mm polypropylene round-bottom tubes (Fisher Scienti®c, Pittsburgh, PA). Following incubation, cells were collected by centrifugation in a TJ-6 tabletop centrifuge with a TH4 rotor and
buckets (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) for 15 min at
1500´ g and stored at )20°C. Frozen cell pellets were processed
by the Cornell DNA Sequencing Facility (Ithaca, NY) for plasmid
puri®cation and sequencing with the primers 27f, 533f (50 GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGG-30 ) [35], and 1492r. Raw sequence data
was assembled into full-length sequences using the program
SeqMan II (DNAStar, Inc.). Following assembly, the consensus
sequence was veri®ed manually by referring to the corresponding
ABI chromatograms of the sequencing reactions. Sequences were
checked for chimeras using the Ribosomal Database Project's
(RDP) Chimera Check program and closest relatives identi®ed
using the RDP's Sequence Aligner [44]. Sequences were then
imported into ARB (Strunk and Ludwig, http://www.biol.chemie.tu-muenchen.de/pub/ARB/) for phylogenetic tree construction [39].

Results
At the study site, the monitoring wells (MW) fall linearly
along approximately 300 meters of the groundwater ¯ow
path. MW4 is in a pristine area 90 m upgradient of where
the coal tar waste was buried (now excavated), while MW8
is the ®rst well downgradient (80 m) of the former source
area. MW36, further downgradient, currently has the
highest level of residual contamination [1]. MW12,
furthest downgradient, has been the least polluted
throughout its contamination history.

Naphthalene-Degrading Isolates
Five isolates were obtained from two of the four monitoring wells. Four isolates (cb1, cb2, cb3, and ek3) were
isolated from MW36, while cb8 was isolated from MW12.
All ®ve strains shared the same ARDRA pattern and one

C. Bakermans, E.L. Madsen

representative isolate (cb3) was chosen for sequencing.
Sequence analysis showed that cb3 was closely related to
Pseudomonas putida (98.9% similarity). None of the clone
libraries (see below) contained the isolates' ARDRA pattern. PCR ampli®cation of nahAc genes with primers Acl
14f and Ac596r detected the nahAc allele in all of the ®ve
isolates. When digested with HaeIII and HhaI, nahAc
amplicons from these isolates displayed the same banding
patterns as nahAc from P. putida NCIB 9816-4 (data not
shown). Because of lack of evidence for anaerobic naphthalene degradation [1, 42], no attempts were made to
isolate anaerobic naphthalene-degrading bacteria.
PCR Ampli®cation of nahAc from Nucleic Acids Extracted
from Groundwater
PCR ampli®cation with primers for nahAc was used to
assess the presence of the archetypal naphthalene degradation genes. The expected mixture of 482 bp amplicons
was found in all four groundwater communities tested
(Fig. 1A). Additional nonspeci®c bands were present in all
cases (except negative controls). The expected 482 bp
amplicons were excised from the gel (shown in Fig. 1A; all
lanes, including MW12) for reampli®cation by PCR (data
not shown) prior to RFLP characterization. Gel slices from
both the negative control (water) and MW12 failed to reamplify. All successful ampli®cations (MW4, MW8,
MW36, P. putida G7, and P. putida NICB 9816-4) were
digested with either HaeIII or HhaI (see Fig. 1B). As expected, from examination of GenBank nahAc entries from
cultured microorganisms, digestion of nahAc from
P. putida G7 and P. putida NICB 9816-4 with HaeIII resulted in 353- and 111-bp bands. The HaeIII RFLP patterns from MW4, MW8, and MW36 all contained the
expected bands. However, evidence for previously undescribed diversity (polymorphisms) in the community
nahAc genes was found. The RFLP pattern of MW8's
HaeIII-digested amplicon contained additional bands at
437 and 255 bp, while the RFLP pattern of MW36's
amplicon contained additional bands at 437 and 320 bp.
Evidence for the community nahAc diversity was also
obtained from the HhaI digests. Although HhaI does not
digest the nahAc gene of archetypal strains, the RFLP
patterns of MW4, MW8, and MW36 contained bands at
430; 290 and 166; and 387 and 199 bp, respectively. Interestingly, none of the wells produced identical patterns
when digested with either HaeIII or HhaI; nahAc amplicans from each well contained unique polymorphisms.

16S rDNA Analysis
DNA samples from the four monitoring wells were examined for 16S rDNA genes by PCR with primers 27f and
1492r. The expected amplicon size (1500 bp) was observed in all samples (except negative controls). Following
cloning of the mixture of amplicons into pCR2.1, ARDRA
patterns of 400 clones were examined, 100 from each well.
Clone nomenclature utilized a hyphenated, paired number

99

system. The ®rst number represents the well from which
the DNA originated (4, 8, 36, or 12). The second number
represents the clone's number (1 to 160). ARDRA pattern
designations were assigned to the ®rst clone from each
well found with that representative pattern.
Histograms of the pattern frequencies are presented in
Fig. 2. Each clone library contained several ARDRA patterns that occurred repeatedly (left side of each panel) and
a predominance of single, unique ARDRA patterns (right
side of each panel). Of 100 clones examined in each clone
library, 57 to 66% were found to contain unique ARDRA
patterns. However, MW4 and MW12 were clearly dominated by one pattern type: 4-11 (23% of clones) and 12-2
(25% of clones), respectively, while MW8 and MW36 had
several more abundant members: 36-9 (15%), 36-28 (8%),
36-20 (5%), 8-11 (16%), 8-45 (12%), and 8-4 (7%). The
majority of patterns were unique to each clone library, data
not shown (90%, 82%, 90%, and 95% for MW4, MW8,
MW36, and MW 12, respectively). Of the 242 total patterns,
11 were present in 2 clone libraries and 1 was found in 3
clone libraries. MW4, MW8, and MW36 shared 3 to 4
patterns with each other, while MW12 shared patterns only
with MW8. The presence of patterns shared between clone
libraries is consistent with hydrologic continuity between
wells. The 4 clone libraries shared approximately the same
level of diversity (similar number of unique patterns) as
determined by the Shannon±Weaver diversity index (H0 )
[45, 52]. H0 was equal to 3.58, 3.53, 3.69, and 3.62 for MW4,
MW8, MW36, and MW12, respectively. Surprisingly, the
currently most contaminated well, MW36, showed the
highest diversity (H0 = 3.69) in its clone library.
Selected 16S rDNA clones were sequenced from each
clone libary (31 total). Because simultaneous digestion
with 2 restriction enzymes was used to generate ARDRA
patterns and can identify 96% of operational taxonomic
units [48], clones containing the same ARDRA pattern
should be very similar. Therefore, when more than one
clone contained the same ARDRA pattern, only one representative clone was sequenced. In MW12, six clones
representing ARDRA patterns found in more than one
clone were sequenced. Nine, six, and eight clones representing ARDRA patterns found in multiple clones were
sequenced from MW4, MW8, and MW36, respectively. In
addition, clones found in more than one clone library were
sequenced (36-111 and 8-65). As anticipated, sequence
analysis revealed the presence of several chimeras (clones
36-31, 36-8, and 8-17). Chimeras were expected to be
present in 10% of clones [21]. Clones 12-30, 4-42, and 12-

100

31 may also be chimeras; however, the diversity of the
divisions in which they grouped and the large number of
partial sequences from environmental clones that they
were similar to precluded the accurate assessment of their
status as chimeras. The sequences analyzed represent 47,
39, 41, and 41% of the clones in the clone libraries from
MW4, 8, 36, and 12, respectively.
Phylogenetic trees were constructed from sequences
obtained from selected clones, pure culture isolates, and
reference strains (Fig. 3). The majority of clones from
MW4 (pristine, aerobic) grouped with Nitrospira (28% of

clones); in the c-proteobacteria (10% of clones) with
Methylomonas and Pseudomonas; or in the b-proteobacteria (8% of clones) with Comamonas and Gallionella. The
majority of clones from MW8 grouped in the b-proteobacteria with Azoarcus and Gallionella (22% of clones), in
the d-proteobacteria with Syntrophus gentianae (13%), or
in the c-proteobacteria with Methylomonas (8%). The
majority of clones from MW36 grouped with the low-GC
gram-positive organisms with Desulfotomaculum (19% of
clones), in the b-proteobacteria with Azoarcus and Comamonas (16%), or in the d-proteobacteria with Syntro-

Clones from the four monitoring wells were identi®ed with a

with the same ARDRA pattern is in parenthesis following the

grouped in the d-proteobacteria with Syntrophus gentianae (27% of clones), with no close relatives (11%), or
with a new division containing Verrucomicrobium (2%).

Discussion
As expected, clear contrasts between culture-based and
nonculture-based descriptions of nahAc were found in this

102

study. Growth-based pure culture techniques revealed
only Pseudomonas-type bacteria and nahAc alleles in the
contaminated areas, while molecular techniques detected
apparent additional naphthalene-degrader diversity as
indicated by nahAc sequence polymorphisms in three of
four wells examined. These results agree with prior investigations elsewhere [25] and at this study site: all
naphthalene-degrading bacteria isolated from site surface
sediments contained the nahAc allele, whereas PCR ampli®cation and RFLP analysis of nahAc in DNA extracted
from highly contaminated (source) and distant downgradient (seep) sediments revealed additional diversity [27±
29]. In contrast, only 45% of naphthalene-degrading isolates from contaminated New Zealand soils contained nahlike alleles; 81% of those alleles shared the same RFLP
pattern as nahAc [38]. DNA extracted from 7 of 9 samples
from the New Zealand contaminated soils contained
ampli®able nahAc alleles; however, amplicon diversity was
not analyzed [38]. Diversity is expected from both culturebased and non-culture-based techniques, since at least 13
naphthalene dioxygenase genes have been identi®ed to
date [8, 10, 17, 19, 24, 26, 36, 37, 62, 67, 68].
By sequencing representatives of the most abundant
ARDRA patterns, we documented changes in community
composition along the groundwater ¯owpath at the study
site. We recognize that our data do not approach an accurate census of the organisms in site groundwater because of unavoidable methodological and genetic biases
(cell lysis, DNA extraction, primer annealing, multiple
PCR cycles, varying gene copy numbers of rRNA, etc. [21,
40, 71]) that distort sequences from their original in situ
abundances in the sampled microbial community. Thus,
we must balance ARDRA-based changes in community
composition across the study site against conservative
interpretation of data. Several studies have indicated that
ARDRA-based community analyses can sometimes correlate well with ¯uorescent in situ hybridization [63] or
RNA hybridization analysis of community structure [22,
23].
MW4 is upstream from the contaminated zone and
represents the background pristine community present
prior to contamination. The predominant genus found in
MW4, Nitrospira (28%), occurred rarely (0±2%) in the
recovered downgradient communities. Members of the
genus Nitrospira are aerobic, nitrite oxidizers. The cproteobacteria, recovered from MW4 and MW8 at approximately the same frequency (10 and 8%, respectively),
were barely represented (0 and 1%) in MW36 and MW12,

C. Bakermans, E.L. Madsen

respectively. The c-proteobacteria found at the site were
represented by phylotypes related to Methylomonas (aerobic to microaerobic methane oxidizers) and Pseudomonas (mesophilic chemoorganotrophs with respiratory
metabolism). The b-proteobacteria, detected at 8% in
MW4, 22% in MW8, and 16% in MW36, were absent in
MW12. Phylotypes related to Comamonas (like Pseudomonas), Azoarcus (facultatively aerobic denitri®ers), and
Gallionella (iron-oxidizing bacteria that live at oxic±anoxic interfaces and neutral pH) represented the b-proteobacteria. Interestingly, no d-proteobacteria were found in
MW4, which had previously been shown to be methanefree [1]. Conversely, all the contaminated wells contained
biogenic methane [1] and sequences closely related to
Syntrophus gentianae of the d-proteobacteria. The genus
Syntrophus comprises bacteria that participate in interspecies hydrogen transfer through the production of hydrogen and are closely associated with hydrogen
consumers such as methanogens or sulfate reducers. The
low-GC gram-positive organisms, represented by sequences related to Desulfotomaculum sp., were rare in
MW8 (1%) but signi®cant in MW36 (19%). Species of the
genus Desulfotomaculum are obligately anaerobic, sulfate
reducers that are widespread, form endospores, and are
capable of chemolithotrophic growth. The overall trend
progressed from communities abundant in sequences related to aerobic bacteria (upstream of the contamination)
to communities abundant in sequences related to anaerobic bacteria (in the contaminated zones).
ARDRA patterns of 400 clones (100 clones from each of
4 MW) were predominantly unique to each well, with 60%
representing unique patterns. Although less diverse than
soil habitats, subsurface microbial communities often
support unique microbial species and/or sequences [55].
Thus, diversity and heterogeneity was expected hereÐand
has been seen in other contaminated systems. For example: based on ARDRA, 50% of clones from a hydrocarbon
and chlorinated-solvent-contaminated aquifer were unique [11], while analysis of 16S rDNA from petroleumcontaminated sediments also indicated heterogeneity [60].
In highly diverse habitats (e.g., soil), encountering unique,
unduplicated ARDRA patterns or sequences is expected [7,
14, 53, 74]. Generally, duplicated patterns or sequences are
only found in environments where diversity was reduced
by strong selective pressure, such as low pH [14, 45] or
hydrologic continuity.
Because of the presence of sulfate and sul®de in site
waters [1], the predominance of phylotypes related to

16S rDNA, nahAc Diversity in Coal Tar Contaminated Aquifer

sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in the clone library from
MW36 was not unexpected. At another site, aerobic hydrocarbon degradation was hypothesized to stimulate the
growth of SRB [13], probably via the consumption of toxic
oxygen. SRB closely related to Desulfosporosinus orientis
(previously named Desulfotomaculum orientis) were associated with intrinsic bioremediation of toluene, probably through syntrophic associations [57]. Furthermore,
naphthalene degradation under sulfate-reducing conditions by enrichment [9, 47, 59] and pure [18] cultures has
been documented. Clearly, potential exists for the direct or
indirect involvement of SRB in coal-tar-waste degradation
in the vicinity of MW36.
The predominant sequence type obtained from both
MW36 and MW8 was highly related to the genus Azoarcus,
which includes many aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading
nitrate reducing bacteria (NRB). Azoarcus species have
been shown to degrade phenol [61, 70], m-xylene [34], and
toluene [64] under denitrifying conditions. Naphthalenedegrading NRB have also been isolated [46, 58]. Pure
cultures of NAP-3-1, closely related to Pseudomonas
stutzeri, coupled denitri®cation to naphthalene oxidation,
while NAP-4, closely related to Vibrio pelagius, oxidized
naphthalene with reduction of nitrate to nitrite [58]. No
nitrate was detected in MW36 or MW8 groundwater;
however nitrate was found in groundwater both upstream
(MW4) and downstream (MW12) of these monitoring
wells [1]. Based on the prevalence of phylotypes related to
NRB in MW36 and MW8 clone libraries, we hypothesize
that any nitrate in recharge waters that reach this depth
may be consumed immediately. NRB could potentially be
involved in the degradation of the monocyciic aromatic
hydrocarbon constituents of the coal tar waste that represent 3.8% of the total mass, of which half is m/p-xylene
[69].
Geochemical data presented in a companion paper [1]
®rmly established that coal tar waste constituents have
induced signi®cant anaerobic carbon and electron ¯ow at
the study site. Detection of sequences related to anaerobic
bacteria predominantly in the contaminated zones of the
site was consistent with the prevalence of in situ anaerobic processes. Yet no indication of anaerobic naphthalene biodegradation was found [1]. To reconcile these
observations, we hypothesize that low numbers of
oxygen-respiring naphthalene-degrading microorganisms
are active in situ at the anaerobic±aerobic interface that
likely surrounds the contaminant plume. In support of
this notion, aerobic naphthalene-metabolizing members

103

of the community have been enumerated [1, 2]; furthermore, the present study easily isolated Pseudomonas sp.
from contaminated groundwater, although their ARDRA
patterns were not detected in clone libraries constructed
from bulk community DNA. In summary, a mixture of
aerobic and anaerobic degradation processes likely prevails at the site.
