The degradation of aromatic compounds by bacteria
is dependent upon specific catabolic operons. The
unique car locus isolated from Sphingomonas CB3 encodes the first four enzymes involved in the catabolism
of the azaarene carbazole. These include a class II
three-component dioxygenase enzyme system, a dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, an extradiol (meta-cleavage)
dioxygenase, and a hydrolase. Homology of deduced
amino acid sequences is closer to corresponding biphenyl catabolic genes than to previously characterised carbazole degradation genes. Gene arrangement
is also identical to that found in some bph loci. The car
genes are transcribed when carbazole is utilised as a
sole carbon source, and although biphenyl does not
serve as a growth substrate for Sphingomonas CB3 it
is able to act as a non-metabolisable inducer of the
car locus. Ecologically the car genes were detected in
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminated
soil associated with a former town gas site. q 1998

curs via an initial angular dioxygenation yielding 2*aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol which is subsequently cleaved
by an extradiol dioxygenase. An alternative pathway
via indole acetic acid may also play a role in carbazole
degradation by LD2 [3]. Recently the genes involved in
the degradation of carbazole by CA10 have been isolated using Tn-5 induced mutational inactivation [4],
and subsequently described in detail [5,6]. The characterised genes encode a novel class III initial dioxygenase, carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase, a divergent extradiol
dioxygenase (meta-cleavage) enzyme and a meta-cleavage compound hydrolase.
To date there is only one other report [5,6] on the
molecular biology of catabolic pathways specific for the
azaarene carbazole. In this paper we describe 6085-bp
of nucleotide sequence of a divergent catabolic locus
isolated from Sphingomonas (formerly Pseudomonas)
strain CB3 which is able to utilise carbazole as sole
carbon and nitrogen source [7].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microbial catabolism of aromatic compounds follows
predictable routes which fall into distinct segments:
conversion of the growth substrate to an arene diol or
substituted arene diol, followed by ring cleavage, with
further catabolism of the ring-cleavage product ultimately feeding through to central metabolism. Many
of these pathways show a high degree of conservation
at the level of gene organization, gene size, and homology of the corresponding enzymes [1].
Catabolic pathways have been described for the microbial degradation of carbazole by Pseudomonas sp.
strains CA10 [2], and LD2 [3]. Metabolite analysis suggests that carbazole degradation in CA10 and LD2 oc1

Bacterial strains. Sphingomonas CB3 is able to grow at the expense of the azaarene carbazole and has been described previously
[7]. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene from strain CB3 has subsequently revealed its closest relative, at 99% homology, to be Sphingomonas subarctica.
DNA manipulation and sequencing. A clone library was generated in Escherichia coli DH5a using EcoRI-digested genomic DNA
prepared from Sphingomonas CB3 [8] ligated into pUC18. All recombinant manipulations were performed according to established methodologies [9] and in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions.
Colonies harbouring recombinant plasmids were screened for the
expression of extradiol dioxygenase activity by the ability to form
the yellow ring-fission product 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde on
spraying colonies with 100 mM catechol [10].
A nested deletion series was generated from the overlapping clones
pJO05-01 and pJO12 using a double-stranded Nested Deletion Kit
(Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmid DNA was isolated using a Quantum
Prep Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Bio-Rad), and clone sequences were determined by the Waikato DNA Sequencing facility using a PRISM
Ready Reaction DNA Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Perkin-Elmer). The reactions were resolved using an ABI model 377 sequencer.

PCR amplification of car genes. A primer pair, C1036 (5*-GGGATCTTTGAACAGGACGA-3*) and C2495 (5*-AGGAGCCTGTCACTGACCAT-3*), was designed to amplify a 1460-bp fragment which
contains the carAa(partial)/carAb/carAc/carAd(partial) genes. These
primers were used to amplify the car genes from soil DNA, and also
in an RT-PCR amplification experiment using CB3 mRNA as the
target.
Total soil DNA was extracted from 0.5 g soil samples using a bead
beating method followed by purification through PVPP (polyvinylpolypyrrolidone) spin columns [11]. PCR amplification was carried
out in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4); 50 mM KCl; 1.5 mM MgCl2; dNTPs
at 200 mM each, 2.5 units PLATINUM Taq DNA polymerase (GibcoBRL); 0.2 mM forward and reverse primers; and template DNA
at 0.1 mg/50 ml reaction. The cycling conditions (Techne Cyclogene
Thermal Cycler) were 5 min at 947C, followed by 25 cycles of 947C
for 2 min, 527C for 1 min, 727C for 2 min, maximal ramp rates
throughout, with the final 727C segment of the cycle extended to 10
min before cooling to 47C. A Southern blot consisting of 20 ml of PCR
product amplified from soil DNA resolved on an agarose gel and
blotted to a positively charged nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus
(NEN Research Products)) was analysed by hybridisation with 32Plabelled carAa(partial)/carAb/carAc/carAd(partial) amplified from
CB3 genomic DNA. Membranes were hybridised overnight at 657C
in 5 1 SSC, followed by stringency washes with 2 1 SSC, 0.1% SDS
for 15 min at 657C, and 0.2 1 SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 657C.
mRNA was isolated, using an RNA extraction kit (RNeasy Mini
Kit Qiagen), from CB3 grown at the expense of different carbon
sources. These included 2 mM carbazole, 10 mM acetate, and 10
mM acetate-grown cells induced for 2 h during late log phase, with
carbazole and biphenyl added to 1 mM. Purified mRNA was treated
with DNase I (GibcoBRL) and RNase inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim) to ensure complete removal of DNA and to maintain the integrity of mRNA. RT-PCR (Titan One Tube RT-PCR System: Boehringer
Mannheim) was used to amplify a fragment of the car locus from
mRNA isolated from Sphingomonas strain CB3 grown at the expense
of different carbon sources. The cycling conditions (Techne Cyclogene
Thermal Cycler) for the RT-PCR amplification were: 507C for 30 min;
947C for 2 min; followed by 10 cycles of 947C for 30 s, 527C for 30 s,
687C for 1 min; followed by 15 cycles of 947C for 30 s, 527C for 30 s,
687C for 80 s; followed by 15 cycles of 947C for 30 s, 527C for 30 s,
687C for 2 min; followed by 947C for 30 s, 527C for 30 s, 687C for 10
min, and cool to 47C. PCR amplification controls omitted the initial
incubation at 507C. Optimal MgCl2 concentration was 1.5 mM.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Isolation of the car Catabolic Genes and
Characterisation of the Extradiol Dioxygenase
The extradiol dioxygenase activity detected in cellfree extracts of the wild-type strain Sphingomonas CB3
grown at the expense of carbazole was isolated and
expressed in a clone designated pJO05 which contained
a 7400-bp EcoRI fragment from CB3. This extradiol
dioxygenase activity was induced by growth on carbazole and was not detected in acetate- or succinategrown cells revealing that this activity is under regulatory control. Southern hybridisation using probe DNA
derived from pJO05 confirmed its origin from CB3 genomic DNA, it was not present in digests of the large
(ú100-kb) plasmid DNA prepared from CB3 (data not
shown). The identity of the extradiol dioxygenase enzyme encoded by pJO05 was evaluated by analysing
the substrate specificity of the functional enzyme ex-

pressed in Escherichia coli DH5a. Specific activity (average of four replicates) of the extradiol dioxygenase
enzyme towards 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (820.6 { 19.4
mmol/min/mg protein) and catechol (24.0 { 1.2 mmol/
min/mg protein) revealed that the pJO05-encoded dioxygenase activity was characteristic of a multiple-ring
extradiol dioxygenase showing a specificity typical of
a 2,3-dihydroxy 1,2-dioxygenase (BphC) rather than a
catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (C23O) enzyme [12,13].
pJO05 contained an internal EcoRI site which allowed the extradiol dioxygenase activity encoded by
pJO05 to be further localised, by deletion, to the derivative pJO05-01. A second derivative pJO05-02, which
lacked an extradiol dioxygenase activity was also obtained. An additional clone pJO12, located upstream
and contiguous to pJO05, was isolated by screening a
HindIII clone library of CB3 by hybridisation using a
300-bp EcoRI/HindIII probe derived from pJ005-01.
Nucleotide Sequence Analysis of the Cloned car Genes
The complete sequence of cloned inserts of pJO0501, pJO12 and 400-bp of the 5* end of clone pJO05-02
was determined for both strands to yield 6085-bp of
sequence (GenBank accession number AF060489). The
DNA had a G/C content of 61.1%, close to that reported for established Sphingomonas species inclusive
of the aromatic compound-degrading sphingomonads
(61.7-67.8%) [14].
Computer analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed the presence of six complete open reading
frames (ORFs), and one partial ORF, each transcribed
in the same orientation (Figure 1). ORFs were initiated
either by the canonical ATG start codon (carAbAcCD),
or by the rarer and less efficient GTG start codon
(carAdB) which is not uncommon in operons involved
in the degradation of aromatic compounds [15,16,17].
Each complete ORF is preceded by a potential ribosome
binding site [18] and ends with TGA as the termination
codon, carAa, which is incomplete, also ends with the
termination codon TGA. By comparison with analogous
genes we estimate that the EcoRI restriction site utilised for cloning is situated between 21-bp and 78-bp
downstream of the start codon of CarAa when compared to the corresponding genes from naphthalene
(Pseudomonas putida G7 nahAc [29]) or biphenyl catabolic genes (Burkholderia LB400 bphA [20]). Further
efforts to clone this region were unsuccessful. Intergenic regions were absent between three car gene
pairs; these correspond to carAb which overlaps carAa
by 11-bp, carAd overlaps carAc by 4-bp, and carB which
overlaps carAd by 14-bp. Similar overlapping genes
have also been described in other degradative gene
clusters [16,19], and the absence of intergenic spaces
between these gene pairs may reflect translational coupling of these genes in CB3, cf. biphenyl dioxygenase
of LB400 [20]. The transcript containing carAd and

FIG. 2. Comparison of the car locus from Sphingomonas CB3
with published catabolic pathways. The corresponding operons include the bph loci from Pseudomonas sp. LB400 [28], Pseudomonas
pseudoalcaligenes KF707 [27] and Pseudomonas putida KF715 [22],
and the car locus is from Pseudomonas sp. strain CA10 [22].

carB may also be subjected to some translational control due to the presence of the less efficient GTG start
codons in these genes.
Sequence analysis of the CB3 car genes revealed that
at the molecular level the deduced amino acid sequences of CarAaAbAcAdBCD showed greatest sequence identity (31-53%) to their homologous counterparts from diverse biphenyl pathways. Homology also
extended to the arrangement of these genes which is
conserved between some bph loci and the CB3 car locus
(Figure 2). The only other reported car sequence shows
very low homology and divergent gene arrangement
[5,6]. For this reason the gene designations we have
adopted use the same nomenclature as that applied to
the biphenyl catabolic genes, namely that from carbazole through to anthranilic acid [2](cf. biphenyl through
to benzoate [23]) the genes should have the same letter
as the isofunctional bph genes [22,24,25,26,27], but
with a car prefix, i.e. carABCD. The cloned car locus
from CB3 therefore encodes, by analogy to previously
described bph genes, CarAaAbAcAdBCD. Gene organisation is conserved between the car locus of strain CB3
and bph loci of the type bphABCD seen in Pseudomonas

sp. KKS102 [21] and Pseudomonas putida KF715 [22],
where the bphC and bphD genes are closely spaced.
This is different to the bph locus of Pseudomonas strain
LB400 where the bphC and bphD genes are separated
by a 3500-bp region containing bphKHJI [28].
The properties and characteristics of predicted polypeptides of the CB3 car locus are summarised in Table
1. Homology of the predicted amino acid sequences
from CB3 to the CA10 car gene products is also shown
and are particularly low. Sequence analysis reveals
that the aromatic ring dioxygenase enzyme from CB3
is a class II type three-component enzyme similar to
biphenyl dioxygenase [27] and toluene dioxygenase
[17]. This is disparate to the carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase from CA10 [6] which is a three-component enzyme
belonging to the class III type similar to naphthalene
dioxygenase [29].
The terminal oxygenase component of the carbazole
dioxygenase from CB3 putatively encoded by carAaAb
consists of two subunits akin to those of biphenyl dioxygenase [27], naphthalene dioxygenase [29] and toluene
dioxygenase [17] which is also disparate to the single
subunit configuration of carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase
from CA10 [6]. We find, however, that the CarAaAb
amino acic sequences show low homology to comparable subunits. Since the specificity of the initial dioxygenases appears to be provided by the subunits of
two-component terminal oxygenase of aromatic dioxygenases [30] this may be a reflection of the narrow
specificity of the car encoded pathway of Sphingomonas
CB3. carAa encodes for a large (a) subunit of the iron
sulfur component of the initial dioxygenase. The predicted amino acid sequence contains a Rieske-type
[2Fe-2S] motif of conserved Cys75,95 and His77,98 residues which is a feature of these subunits. carAb encodes the small (b) subunit of the iron sulfur component
of the initial dioxygenase. CarAc shows homology to the
ferredoxin subunits of initial dioxygenases. In common
with ferredoxin subunits of this type, CarAc has a conserved binding motif for a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] centre
presented by Cys43,62 and His45,65. carAd encodes the
reductase subunit of the initial dioxygenase, the amino
acid sequence is predicted to be a membrane-associated
protein.
Unlike the car genes from CA10, CB3 has a gene
encoding a dihydrodiol dehydrogenase which we have
designated CarB. carC encodes for an extradiol dioxygenase enzyme. CarC contains the amino acid residues - His147, His 211 and Glu 262 - which are conserved
in extradiol dioxygenases where they are implicated in
iron coordination by the active enzyme [31,32]. carD
encodes for a hydrolase which shows most homology to
biphenyl pathway hydrolases.
A closer phylogenetic analysis of the individual CB3
car genes consistently places these sequences away
from the main groups which represent sequences derived from biphenyl degrading, as well as naphthalene/

phenanthrene-degrading strains. Two examples are
provided. The first (Figure 3) reveals that CarAa is
more closely related to, yet distinct from, the corresponding bph sequences than to CarAa from CA10
[5,6]. The second example (Figure 4) is provided by
CarC which is also divergent and placed in a position
intermediate to that of the corresponding genes from
biphenyl of naphthalene degrading strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the remaining CB3 car
genes all occupy similarly divergent positions.
Pathway Specificity and Induction of the car Genes
Transcriptional analysis has confirmed that this car
locus is expressed during growth of CB3 at the expense
of carbazole, and since no other aromatic hydrocarbon
can serve as a growth substrate we propose these are
unique car genes. By applying RT-PCR using the
primer pair C1036/C2495 we were able to amplify
carAa(partial)/carAb/carAc/carAd(partial) from mRNA
extracted from carbazole-grown cells (Figure 5). No RTPCR product was amplified from mRNA extracted from
acetate-grown CB3 cells.
Experiments using biphenyl and carbazole as independent inducers of acetate-grown cells of CB3 revealed that both carbazole and biphenyl were able to
act as inducers of the car locus (Figure 5). This is particularly interesting as biphenyl does not serve as a
growth substrate for CB3 and was not transformed by
cells of CB3 growing at the expense of carbazole. As
biphenyl is able to induce expression of the car operon
it would appear that the substrate specificity of the
terminal oxygenase component the initial dioxygenase

enzyme complex is narrow, and does not extend to biphenyl thus preventing its transformation. This would
appear different to the carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase
from CA10 has been shown to readily oxidise biphenyl
[6]. Interestingly resting cell assays have been used to
show that both naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase and biphenyl 2,3-dioxygenase enzymes are able to oxidise carbazole [33], however this oxidation does not occur in
an angular position as described for the car pathway
of CA10 [2,5,6].
The lower enzymes of the car locus would not constitute a metabolic block to biphenyl catabolism as these
are able to transform intermediates of the biphenyl
pathway. CarCD-expressing clones transform the arene diol 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl to the yellow metacleavage product 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4dienoate, which is further metabolised by the hydrolase
activity of CarD resulting in the disappearance of the
yellow meta-cleavage product (data not shown).
The gene sequences of the car locus show sufficient
homology to isofunctional genes involved in the degradation of other aromatic compounds for common ancestries to be shared [1]. We speculate that this car operon
is related to ancestral bph genes which share a common
evolutionary background evolving to degrade biphenyl
and its naturally occurring analogues. Evidence to support this supposition includes the following; (i) The
ability of biphenyl to act as a non-metabolisable inducer of the car genes may signal a recent divergence
which allowed the enzymes of this operon to utilise
carbazole instead of biphenyl as a growth substrate.
This may have occurred through a relaxing of the specificity of regulation, concomitant with a change in the

gene order of the car locus from CB3 show greater homology to characterised bph loci than to the previously
described car genes of CA10; (iv) The dihydrodiol dehydrogenase encoded by carB may not be required for
carbazole degradation. Previous studies have suggested that its product 2*-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol may
form spontaneously from the product of the initial dioxygenase [2,3,5,6], however these studies have yet to be
supported by resting-cell assays using a cloned carbazole dioxygenase.
Environmental Occurrence of the car Genes
As with all sequencing studies it is important to bear
in mind the significance of the characterised genes not
only from the prespective of the host wild type strain,
but also from an environmental or ecological perspective. Given that azaarenes such as carbazole have been
detected in ground water at industrial locations such
as town gas sites [34], coal gasification plants [35] and
creosote contaminated soils [36] we were interested in
determining whether car genes analagous to those

DNA extracts. Pristine soils and PAH contaminated
soils were collected from the site of a former town gas
site in Hamilton, New Zealand. Using a 25 cycle PCR
amplification we were able to detect by hybridisation
of a Southern blot the presence of carAa(partial)/carAb/
carAc/carAd(partial) in only the most contaminated
soil sample HHS, but not in less heavily contaminated
and uncontaminated soils (Figure 6). These results indicate that the car genes are indeed present as a component of the microbial population present in some contaminated soils. The development of additional strategies for environmental probing will ultimately benefit
from the continued characterisation of diverse catabolic
genes such as the car genes we have described in this
study. Further studies would be useful to determine
whether these car genes are enriched in environments
contaminated with azaarenes such as carbazole or are
broadly distributed.
