The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is the deepest and largest offshore spill in the
United State history and its impacts on marine ecosystems are largely unknown. Here, we showed
that the microbial community functional composition and structure were dramatically altered in a
deep-sea oil plume resulting from the spill. A variety of metabolic genes involved in both aerobic and
anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation were highly enriched in the plume compared with outside the
plume, indicating a great potential for intrinsic bioremediation or natural attenuation in the deep sea.
Various other microbial functional genes that are relevant to carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur
and iron cycling, metal resistance and bacteriophage replication were also enriched in the plume.
Together, these results suggest that the indigenous marine microbial communities could have a
significant role in biodegradation of oil spills in deep-sea environments.

Introduction
On 20 April 2010, a massive oil leak occurred in the
Gulf of Mexico’s Mississippi Canyon area at a depth
of 1544 m, releasing B4.9 million barrels of crude
oil into the deep ocean before the wellhead was
finally capped on 15 July 2010 (The Federal
Interagency Solutions Group, Oil Budget Calculator
Science and Engineering Team, November 2010).
Chemical dispersants, including COREXIT
EC9500A and COREXIT EC9527A, were used on
site at one of the highest rates in history to accelerate
oil dispersal. A deep-water oil plume was initially
detected at a depth of 1000–1200 m below the
surface (Camilli et al., 2010; Hazen et al., 2010;
Mascarelli, 2010a), but at last account (Mascarelli,
2010b) could no longer be detected, presumably as a
result of dispersion and microbial degradation
(OSAT, 2010). Significant environmental differences
in the deep sea of Gulf of Mexico from other historic
offshore oil spills present an urgent need to better
understand the fate and impacts of the oil on this
specific habitat (Kerr et al., 2010a,b).
In marine ecosystems, microorganisms are known
to have predominant roles in degradation of oil
contaminants (Head et al., 2003; Larter et al., 2003).
Therefore, it was expected that the indigenous
microbial communities would have a significant role
in degradation of the deep oil plume. This hypothesis
was supported by two recent studies that explored
the microbial and chemical properties of samples
collected from the deep oil plume (Camilli et al.,
2010; Hazen et al., 2010). Hazen et al. (2010) used a
combination of molecular, chemical and physiological
approaches to investigate the microbial and
chemical composition in the deep-sea plume compared
with uncontaminated water from the same
depth outside the plume. They demonstrated that the
oil depletion was due to a combination of mixing,
dispersion and biodegradation by microbes residing
in the deep sea (Hazen et al., 2010).
In this study, samples from the deep-sea plume,
oil-contaminated seawater (hereafter referred to as
‘oil plume’ in the following text) and non-plume
controls (seawater samples at same depth that were
not contaminated with oil) were analyzed with
a functional gene microarray, the GeoChip 4.0 Received 3 March 2011; revised 6 June 2011; accepted 6 June

(Hazen et al., 2010), to address the following
questions: (i) How did the oil contamination affect
the marine microbial community functional composition
and structure? (ii) How did different microbial
functional genes involved in key microbial processes
shift in response to the oil spill? (iii) Were
functional genes specific to hydrocarbon (HC)
degradation processes enriched in the oil plume?
Our results indicated that the oil spill dramatically
altered microbial community functional structure,
the marine microbial communities present were
metabolically diverse, and that these communities
were able to respond to the oil spill.
Materials and methods
The following is the summary of methods used in
this study. More detailed information is provided in
Supplementary Data A.
Sample description
Between 27 May and 2 June 2010, seawater samples
were collected from the Gulf of Mexico during two
monitoring cruises on the R/V Ocean Veritas and R/
V Brooks McCall (Supplementary Table S1) as
previously described (Hazen et al., 2010). Briefly,
two colored dissolved organic matter WETstar
fluorometers (WET Labs, Philomath, OR, USA) were
attached to a CTD sampling rosette (Sea-Bird
Electronics Inc., Bellevue, WA, USA) and used to
detect the presence of oil. The fluorometer results
were subsequently confirmed by laboratory HC
analysis. Niskin bottles attached to the CTD rosette
were used to capture water samples at various
depths with detected HCs. Eight samples (BM053,
BM054, BM057, BM058, BM064, OV201, OV401 and
OV501) from the MC252 dispersed oil plume, and
five samples (OV003, OV004, OV009, OV013 and
OV014) from non-plume at a depth of 1099–1219 m
were analyzed in this study.
To better define the geochemical properties of the
plume and non-plume samples, two sets of variables
were measured: (i) seawater variables (dissolved
oxygen, temperature, small particle counts, total
ammonia nitrogen, nitrite (NO2-N), total iron), orthophosphate
(PO4-P) and acridine orange direct count)
and (ii) oil composition variables (fluorometer
detection of oil, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
isopropylbenzene, n-propylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene,
tert-butylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene,
sec-butylbenzene, p-isopropyltoluene, n-butylbenzene,
naphthalene and o-xylene, m- and p-xylenes)
(Hazen et al., 2010).
DNA amplification and labeling
Approximately 100 ng of DNA that was previously
extracted from the samples (Hazen et al., 2010) was
amplified using a modification of the Templiphi
kit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The
amplified DNA (2 mg) was then labeled with Cy3
using random primers and the Klenow fragment of
DNA polymerase I (Wu et al., 2006) and then
purified and dried in a SpeedVac (45 1C, 45 min;
ThermoSavant, Milford, MA, USA) before hybridization.
GeoChip 4.0 hybridization and data pre-processing
The GeoChip 4.0, containing 83 992 50-mer oligonucleotide
probes targeting 152 414 genes in 410
gene categories for different microbial functional
and biogeochemical processes, was synthesized by
NimbleGen (Madison, WI, USA). All hybridizations
were carried out at 42 1C with 40% formamide for
16 h on a MAUI hybridization station (BioMicro,
Salt Lake City, UT, USA). After hybridization, the
arrays were scanned (NimbleGen MS200, Madison,
WI, USA) at a laser power of 100%. Signal
intensities were measured based on scanned images,
and spots with signal-to-noise ratios lower than 2
were removed before statistical analysis as described
previously (He et al., 2010).
Statistical analysis
Pre-processed GeoChip data were further analyzed
with different statistical methods: (i) microbial
diversity index, the two-tailed t-test and response
ratio (Luo et al., 2006); (ii) hierarchical clustering for
microbial community structure and composition
(de Hoon et al., 2004); (iii) analysis of similarity,
permutational multivariate analysis of variance
using distance matrices and multiresponse permutation
procedure analysis of differences of microbial
communities (Anderson, 2001); (iv) canonical correspondence
analysis (CCA) for linking microbial
communities to environmental variables (Ramette
and Tiedje, 2007; Zhou et al., 2008); and (v) partial
CCA for co-variation analysis of wellhead distance
and environmental variables (variation partitioning
analysis). Details for all methods are provided in the
Supplementary Information.
Results
Functional gene changes in response to oil spill
To assess the dynamic changes of microbial communities
in response to oil spill, microbial community
functional composition and structure were
analyzed using functional gene arrays (GeoChip
4.0). Significantly more functional genes (Po0.01)
were detected in the oil plume samples than in nonplume
control (Supplementary Table S2). The
overall microbial functional diversity was also
significantly (Po0.01) higher in the plume samples
based on Shannon–Weiner (H0
) and Simpson’s (1/D)
indices. Consistent with geochemical ordination
patterns, hierarchical clustering analysis showed
that all plume samples were clustered together and
well separated from non-plume samples (Figure 1

Z Lu et al
452

and Supplementary Figure S1), as also shown for the
microbial communities at a phylogenetic level
(Hazen et al., 2010). However, considerable variability
in functional gene distribution was observed
among different samples and some functional genes
were common to all samples, although others were
unique to oil plume samples (Figure 1). For
example, Group 6, with 1439 or 20.14% of all genes
detected, largely involved in organic remediation,
carbon degradation, denitrification, sulfate
reduction, metal resistance and stress response, was
generally detected in all samples. Groups 1, 2, 10
and 17, with 2.2%, 3.9%, 20.5% and 10.8% of all
genes detected, were mainly detected in the plume
samples (Figure 1). In addition, the microbial
community functional structure was significantly
(Po0.05) different between the plume and nonplume
samples as revealed by the three complementary
non-parametric multivariate statistical
tests (analysis of similarity, permutational

matrices and multiresponse permutation procedure)
(Table 1).
Oil as a predominant factor shaping microbial
community functional structure
CCA was performed to determine the most significant
environmental variables shaping microbial
community structure. On the basis of variance in
inflation factors, seven variables were selected:
dissolved oxygen, temperature, total volatile HC,
total extractable petroleum HC, fluorometer detection
of oil, phosphate and iron. The specified CCA
model was significant (P ¼ 0.026). Of these, the total
volatile HC, extractable petroleum HC, fluorometer
detection of oil and dissolved oxygen were the most
significantly correlated with plume samples
(Figure 2). To separate the effects of seawater
geochemical variables, geographic distance and oil
composition on microbial community structure, a
CCA-based variation partitioning analysis (Ramette
and Tiedje, 2007; Zhou et al., 2008) was performed.
Seawater geochemical variables, oil composition
and wellhead distance showed a significant correlation
(P ¼ 0.041) with the functional gene structure of
the community. Oil composition explained substantially
more variations (48.34%, P ¼ 0.03) than seawater
variables (21.76%, P ¼ 0.017), whereas
distance independently explained 9.1% (P ¼ 0.43)
of the observed variation (Figure 3). About 28% of
the community functional variation based on GeoChip
data remained unexplained by the above
selected variables, which is significantly lower than
those observed in other systems such as soils
(Ramette and Tiedje, 2007; Zhou et al., 2008). These
results indicate that oil contaminants could be a
dominant factor shaping microbial community
functional structure and potentially regulating
associated microbial functional processes.
Oil spill stimulated increase in functional genes for
HC degradation
A substantial number of genes involved in HC
degradation were detected in the oil plume samples
(Hazen et al., 2010), especially those involved in
degrading alkanes, alkynes and cycloalkanes, BTEX
and related aromatics, chlorinated aromatics,
heterocyclic aromatics, nitroaromatics, polycyclic
aromatics and aromatic carboxylic acids. For

example, gene alkB encoding alkane 1-monooxygenase,
a key enzyme responsible for the initial
oxidation of inactivated alkanes, showed a significantly
(Po0.05) higher abundance, with 19–26
genes detected in the oil contaminated samples and
11–15 detected in the non-oil contaminated samples.
The alkB genes derived from Rhodospirillum
centenum SW, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus HD100,
Prauserella rugosa, Roseobacter sp. CCS2, Mycobacterium
bovis AF2122/97, Bacillus sp. BTRH40,
Gordonia sp. Cg and Rhodococcus sp. RHA1
appeared to be dominant in all oil plume samples
(Supplementary Figure S2).
GeoChip analysis also detected many aerobic PAH
degradation genes from a variety of microorganisms
(Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S3). PAH
degradation genes were more abundant in the plume
samples, while some were unique to the plume
samples. Although oxygen was still present in the
plume samples (Camilli et al., 2010; Hazen et al.,
2010), the gene bbs (beta-oxidation of benzylsuccinate)
for anaerobic toluene degradation was also
enriched in plume samples. These bbs genes were
derived from putative E-phenylitaconyl-CoA
hydratase of Azoarcus sp. EbN1 and Thauera
aromatic, and benzylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase
of Azoarcus sp. EbN1 (Figure 5).
Shifts of the genes involved in key biogeochemical
cycling processes
Carbon. Among the carbon cycling genes detected,
798 genes involved in the degradation of complex
carbon compounds, such as starch, hemicellulose,
cellulose, chitin, lignin and aromatics, showed
positive hybridization signals. Most of these genes
(for example, pulA, xylA, xynA, lip, limEH and
vanA) showed significantly (Po0.05) higher
abundance in plume than in non-plume samples
(Supplementary Figure S4). These types of genes
could also be important in degradation of various oil
components and their intermediates.

In total, seven probes were designed for bbs genes in GeoChip 4.0
and three probes were detected in the samples.

pmoA genes for methane monooxygenase were
detected in the plume samples. Specifically, mcrA
genes from Methanococcus aeolicus Nankai-3,
Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1 and Methanocorpusculum
labreanum Z were detected in all of the oil
plume samples, but most of them were from
uncultured microorganisms. Significantly (Po0.05)
higher signal intensities were observed for mcrA in
the plume than in the non-plume samples (Supplementary
Figure S5). However, no significant differences
were found for pmoA and mmoX (particulate
methane monooxygenase) between plume and nonplume
samples.
Nitrogen. Petroleum generally contains about
0.1–2% nitrogen, and given the large quantities of
oil involved, it may act as an N pool in this
ecosystem. Interestingly, nasA (nitrate reductase)
and nir (nitrite reductase) for assimilatory N reduction,
and gdh (glutamate dehydrogenase) for ammonia
assimilation exhibited significantly (Po0.05 or
0.01) higher signal intensities in plume samples
(Figure 6). The observed stimulation of N assimilation
processes could be due to an increase of
microbial biomass (Hazen et al., 2010). However,
no significant differences were observed for other
N-cycling genes, for example, nitrification, denitrification
and N fixation (Figure 6).
Sulfur. Sulfite reduction genes were highly abundant
in the deep-sea plume: 81–102 dsrA/B genes for
dissimilatory sulfite reductase, and 8–12 AprA
genes for dissimilatory adenosine-50
-phosphosulfate
reductase were detected with significantly (Po0.05)
higher abundance in the plume than in non-plume
samples (Supplementary Figure S6). Microbial

were frequently detected in each sample, while most
of the genes detected were from uncultured microorganisms
(for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria)
from various environments. The results suggest that
sulfate reduction could be enhanced when coupled
with HC degradation.
Phosphorus and iron reduction. As phosphorus is
often a limiting factor for oil bioremediation, it is
essential to understand phosphorus cycling in
marine ecosystems. Genes encoding exopolyphosphatase
(ppx) for inorganic polyphosphate degradation
and phytase for phytate degradation were
detected with significantly (Po0.01 and Po0.05,
respectively) increased abundance in plume samples
(Supplementary Figure S7). These results
suggested that organic phosphorus release could be
stimulated by oil contamination. In addition, higher
(Po0.1) signal intensities for 61 detected cytochrome
c genes were observed in plume samples
(Supplementary Figure S8), suggesting that HC
degradation coupled with metal reduction could
occur in the deep water.
Metal resistance. A substantial number (917) of the
genes involved in resistance to various metals were
detected, many of which showed significantly
(Po0.05) increased abundance in plume samples
(Supplementary Figure S9). Genes encoding reductases

detected was normalized by all detected gene sequences using the

sum of signal intensity of all detected sequences of this gene
divided by the grand sum of signal intensity of the detected N
cycle genes, and weighted by the fold change of the signal
intensity of this gene in plume to that in non-plume. For each
functional gene, red indicates that this gene had a higher signal
intensity in plume than in non-plume and their significance was
indicated with two stars (**) at Po0.01, whereas blue indicates
that this gene had a lower signal intensity in oil-plume than in
non-plume. Grey-colored genes were not targeted by this

(terC, terD and terZ) were more (Po0.05 or 0.01) abundant in the plume samples.
Bacteriophages were also significantly stimulated In total, 52 bacterial phage genes associated with host recognition, lysis, replication and structure were observed in all samples. The signal intensities for many of the genes involved in replication were significantly (Po0.05) higher in the plume than in the non-plume samples (Figure 7), supporting the
suggestion by Head et al. (2006) that bacteriophages could be an important factor for intrinsic bioremediation of HCs.
Discussion
The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was one of the worst environmental disasters in the United State history. The impact of an oil spill of such an unprecedented magnitude and depth on marine ecosystems is largely unknown.
Using the GeoChip-based high-throughput microarray technology, we showed that diverse microbial
functional groups (a group of genes involved in
certain functional processes), including those
important to HC degradation, carbon metabolism,
methanogenesis, nitrogen assimilation, sulfate reduction,
phosphorus release, metal resistance and
bacteriophage replication, were more highly represented
in the oil plume samples than in non-plume
samples from the same depth. Also, the changes
in community functional structure were highly
correlated to the changes in geochemistry, with
oil being the predominant factor shaping the functional
composition and structure of the microbial
communities. Our results support the phylogenybased
study by Hazen et al. (2010) that the deepsea
marine microbial communities underwent a
dynamic change in response to the oil spill and
associated geochemical changes. Our results are also
consistent with previous studies of oil spill and
petroleum contamination (Harayama et al., 2004;
Head et al., 2006; Bordenave et al., 2007), which
showed that microorganisms able to utilize HCs
became dominant in oil-contaminated sites. Such
functional gene information is useful for assessing
the impacts of oil spills and should facilitate the
design of appropriate strategies and approaches to
deal with petroleum contamination.
The clean-up of the deep-sea oil plume will
primarily depend on the indigenous microbes
present in this environment, as current technology
does not allow removing the dispersed oil and gas at
such great depths. One of the critical environmental
questions is whether microorganisms for degrading
various HCs exist in the community and whether
they respond to oil spill. Our GeoChip results
indicated that many functional genes/populations
involved in both aerobic and anaerobic degradation
of various oil components are detected and/or
enriched in the oil plume, indicating that the
indigenous HC-degrading populations are capable
of responding to the oil spill. For example, alkB for
alkanes, Xamo for alkene, genes bco, ohbAB,
GCoADH and pimF for benzoate, genes mdlA, mdlB
and mdlC for mandelate, and genes Apc and catB for
BTEX metabolic pathway exhibited a significantly
(Po0.05) higher abundance in the oil plume than in the non-oil plume. The changes in relative abundance of these genes/populations were significantly correlated with the concentrations of various oil contaminants in the samples (Hazen et al., 2010).

Especially, several genes for PAH degradation were
enriched in the oil plume samples, which could be
important in determining the long-term effects of the
oil spill on the marine ecosystems. Also, consistent
with phylogenetic gene distribution obtained using
a phylogenetic microarray ‘PhyloChip’ (Hazen et al.,
2010), functional genes representative of the order
Oceanospirillales appeared to have significantly
higher (Po0.01) abundance in the plume samples
than in non-plume samples, although the dominance
of the Oceanospirillum population consuming
the oil in the plume was based on clone library
and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes (Hazen
et al., 2010). GeoChip was not originally designed to
link the detection of functional genes to the
existence of related microbial population and it
contains 567 functional genes derived from the
order Oceanospirillales, with 25 genes detected in
this study. In addition, a large number of metal
resistance genes were enriched in plume samples,
which are usually linked to organic degradation
genes, for example, on plasmids (Parales and
Haddock, 2004; Kunapuli et al., 2007). Our GeoChip
results demonstrated that there is a great potential
for intrinsic bioremediation of oil contamination in
the deep-sea environment.
Anaerobic HC degradation associated with sulfate
reduction, denitrification and methanogenesis has
long been considered the prevailing mechanism for
petroleum biodegradation in the deep subsurface
(Head et al., 2003; Aitken et al., 2004; Kniemeyer
et al., 2007; Jones et al., 2008). Recent investigations
have demonstrated that several classes of petroleum
HCs, including alkanes (So et al., 2003), mono- and
polycyclic aromatic compounds (Meckenstock et al.,
2000; Widdel and Rabus, 2001), and short-chain HCs
(Kniemeyer et al., 2007), can be degraded anaerobically
under nitrate-, iron- or sulfate-reducing conditions,
or under methanogenic conditions (Harayama
et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2008). Indeed, a substantial
number of dsrA/B genes for sulfate reduction, mcrA
genes for methanogenesis, narG, nirS, nirK and nosZ
responsible for denitrification and populations for
metal reduction were detected in this study. Also,
dsrA/B and mcrA genes showed significantly
(Po0.05 or 0.01) higher abundance in the plume
than in the non-plume samples. In addition, bbs
genes for the strict anaerobic toluene degradation
were detected and enriched in the plume samples. It
is possible that anaerobic HC degradation could
have most likely occured through microaggregate
formation as reported in Hazen et al. (2010).
Hydrocarbon degradation is generally limited by
nutrient availability, which can be improved by
nutrient recycling through phage-mediated biomass
turnover (Jiang et al., 1998; Head et al., 2006; Paul,
2008). As significant biomass increase was observed
(Hazen et al., 2010) in the plume samples, bacteriophages
could have critical roles in HC degradation.
Approximately 43% of marine bacterial
isolates have been found to contain prophages (Jiang
et al., 1998; Paul, 2008), which are induced by
various environmental contaminants, such as fuel
oil (Cochran et al., 1998). The oil spill may stimulate
the growth of pathogenic bacteria in marine environments
and many pathogens are capable of
efficiently degrading HCs (Rojo and Martı´nez,
2010). The research on phages has been heavily
slanted to those that affect human-related activities,
health/medical and industry. As no target genes for
Oceanospirillum phages were designed on GeoChip
4.0, the Oceanospirillum phages were not detected.
Genes for both iron uptake (iro) and adherence (pap
and pilin) were significantly (Po0.01 or 0.05)
enriched in the plume samples. The increase in
the abundance of microorganisms capable of producing
siderophores, highly specific iron-chelating
compounds, may facilitate microbial acquisition of
iron, a limiting nutrient in marine systems (Barbeau
et al., 2001a, b), thereby potentially increasing HC
degradation.
A substantial quantity of methane gas was
released together with the oil (The Federal Interagency
Solutions Group, Oil Budget Calculator
Science and Engineering Team, November 2010;
Kessler et al., 2011), which may result in more
methane in the oil plume ecosystem and have the
potential to greatly impact methane metabolism.
GeoChip targets three key genes/enzymes involved
in methane metabolism, with mcrA encoding
methyl coenzyme M reductase for methanogenesis
and two enzymes/genes (methane monooxygenase/
mmoX and particulate methane monooxygenase/
pmoA) for methanotrophy (He et al., 2010). In this
study, pmoA and mmoX genes for aerobic methane
oxidation did not show a statistically significant
change though their abundance was higher in plume
samples than in non-plume samples. There are two
possible explanations for this: one is that the aerobic
methane oxidation was inhibited owing to the
presence of easier to degrade alkanes in the deep
sea, and the other is that the methane gas was moved
up to the surface more directly and did not
accumulate in the deep oil plume. Also, unlike
propane, methane may form gas hydrates at the deep
plume temperature and pressure, making it unavailable
to microorganisms (Valentine et al., 2010).
However, significantly (Po0.05) higher signal intensities
were observed for mcrA in the plume than
non-plume samples, indicating that those enriched
mcrA genes derived from methanogens likely link to
HC degradation rather than plume methane release
(Harayama et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2008). Enzymes
or genes involved in anaerobic methane oxidation,
however, remain unclear; thus, we could not detect
this functional process.
In this study, many functional genes were
detected in the uncontaminated samples that were
not detected in the contaminated samples (Supplementary
Table S3 and Supplementary Figure S10).
These results suggest that oil spills can select
against those populations containing these genes,

or that specific members of the community have a
selective advantage if they are capable of HC
degradation and these grow to represent a greater
proportion of the functional gene repertoire.
In conclusion, our results indicate that a variety of
HC-degrading functional genes were enriched in
response to oil contamination and associated environmental
changes. Our results also imply that there
is a great potential for in situ bioremediation of oil
contaminants in the deep-seawater ecosystem, and
such oil-degrading populations and associated
microbial communities may have a significant role
in determining the ultimate fates and consequences
of the spilled oil. However, to further understand
and evaluate the potential impacts of this unprecedented
oil spill on the marine ecosystem structure
and function, it is essential to launch an integrated
and comprehensive monitoring program to track the
dynamics and adaptive responses of microbial
communities together with other physical and
chemical analysis of tracing oil contaminants and their products.
