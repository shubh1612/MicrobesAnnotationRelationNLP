Hydrocarbons and Microbial Activities In

Sediment Of An Arctic Lake One Year After
Contamination With Leaded Gasoline

AMIKAM HOROWITZ, ALAN SEXSTONE and RONALD M. ATLAS
ABSTRACT. Hydrocarbons were found to persist in the sediment of an Arctic lake
one year after the lake was accidentally contaminated with leaded gasoline. The
contaminating gasoline was continuing to spread from the original site of

contamination. High numbers of hydrocarbon utilizing microorganisms were found in
the contaminated sediment. Rates of nitrogen fixation did not appear to be affected by

hydrocarbon contamination, but potential denitrification activities appeared to be
altered by the gasoline. Fertilizer application resulted in a moderate decrease of

hydrocarbon concentrations in the sediment.

RÉSUMÉ. On a constate que des hydrocarbures persistaient dans les sédiments d'un
lac arctique, un an après que le lac était pollué accidentellement par de l'essence au
plomb (tétraéthyle). De l'essence polluante continuait à se répandre à partir du site

originel de pollution. Dans les sédiments contaminés, on trouvait des micro-organismes

utilisant toutes sortes d'hydrocarbure. La contamination par les hydrocarbures ne
paraissait pas affecter les taux de fixation de l'azote mais l'essence semblait altérer les
activités potentielles de denitrification. A un épendage d'engrais, résultait une

décroissance modérée de la concentration d'hydrocarbures dans le sédiment.

INTRODUCTION

Refined oil spillages, although often of lesser magnitude as the one desc
here, frequently occur around developing areas in the Arctic and are a s

source of hydrocarbon contamination that has not received suffic
scientific attention. In August, 1976, an accidental gasoline spillage
estimated 55,000 gallons of leaded MOGAS was detected near a fresh

lake at the Naval Arctic Research Laboratory (NARL) located at Barrow,
Alaska. The source of the spillage was a break in a pipeline buried in a gravel
pad at the permafrost level. The spilled gasoline moved through the gravel pad
over the permafrost and entered the nearby freshwater lake. We previously

reported on the immediate effects of the leaded gasoline on the bacterial
community and the ability of the microorganisms to degrade the gasoline
(Horowitz and Atlas, 1977). The present study extends the previous work by
examining the movement and persistence of the gasoline and the effects on
microorganisms in the gravel sediments of the lake one year after spillage. A
field assessment of fertilizer stimulated biodégradation of gasoline was also
made.

Movement of gasoline was determined by measuring hydrocarbon
concentrations in sediment along a transect from the site of contamination to a

site beyond where any hydrocarbons had been found during the previous
summer. Biodegradation of gasoline was assessed by measuring the
hydrocarbon biodégradation potentials of the indigenous microbial
populations and by chemically analysing the residual hydrocarbons. The
effects of gasoline on the indigenous microbial community was examined by

determining levels of selected microbial populations. Since microbiological
nitrogen cycling is an essential process in maintaining ecologie balance and
supporting hydrocarbon degradation in Arctic ecosystems we measured

potential rates of nitrogen fixation and denitrification in sediment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample Sites

heavy gasoline contamination (shallow pools, sites A-D) and al

northwest shore of the lake. Gasoline had been detected only as far as
during the previous summer when the spillage occurred. Four areas (si
B, K, L) were selected for studying the effects of fertilizer application

(American Green 10-6-4, Free Flow Fertilizers Co., Maumee, Ohio) at an
application rate of 38 g/m2. Sediment gravel samples were collected weekly
for eight weeks starting on June 10, 1977. Samples were collected in sterile
glass containers and immediately returned to the laboratory for processing.
Hydrocarbon Analysis

Portions of the sediment samples were transferred to sterile whirlpak bags,
poisoned with 3% w/v KCN, and frozen for later analysis. One hundred gram

samples (dry weight basis) were thawed and extracted with 250 ml diethyl
ether using a Soxhlet extractor with an extraction time of 2 hours. Samples
were concentrated (10 or 100 fold) at 25 °C under a dry hydrocarbon-free air

stream to a fixed volume but were not brought to dry ness. Samples were
analysed by gas liquid chromatography using a Hewlett Packard model 5830
reporting gas Chromatograph operated with dual 2 m x 0.3 cm stainless steel
columns packed with 3% OV 1 on 80/100 Supelcoport, nitrogen carrier flow =
22 ml/min and temperature = 80 °C isothermal (2 min), program to 250 °C (8
°C/min), 250 °C isothermal (20 min). Duplicate samples were analysed in each
case. Area response was corrected using the solvent peak as internal standard
to adjust for size variations of automatic injections. Total integrated area units
were converted to weight units using a standard curve derived from gas
Chromatographie area response to known amounts of gasoline.
Enumeration of Microorganisms

Viable heterotrophs were enumerated by plating samples on a medium
designated TGA (0.75% trypticase peptone, 0.25% phytone peptone, 0.25%
NaCl, 0.1% unleaded gasoline, 1.5% agar). Gasoline hydrocarbon utilizing
microorganisms were enumerated on medium BA-G (Bushnell Haas agar
exposed to volatile gasoline hydrocarbons; Horowitz and Atlas 1977).
Gasoline utilizing and tolerant microorganisms were enumerated on medium

GA (Bushnell Haas agar with 0.5% emulsified leaded MOGAS; Horowitz and
Atlas 1977). Incubation was at 15 °C for one week. Presumptive
heterotrophic denitrifiers were enumerated on Difco nitrate agar incubated at
15 °C for one week under an atmosphere of helium. All plate counts were
performed in duplicate.
Hydrocarbon Biodegradation Potential Activity

Hydrocarbon biodégradation potential activities were measured using
unleaded gasoline spiked with either l-14C-toluene (sp. act. 0.013 /¿Ci/ml),
l-14C-n-decane (sp. act. 0.01 ju,Ci/ml) or l-14C-napthalene (sp. act. 0.013
/¿Ci/ml). Sediment samples (10 ml of a 1:10 dilution) were placed in 60 ml
serum bottles containing 10 ml sterile nutrient solution (10 mM NH4NO3, 0.5
mM Na2HPO4). The bottles were sealed with rubber serum stoppers and 50 ¿d
of gasoline injected into each vial. Fifty fii 1-14C sodium acetate (sp. act. 10

/LtCi/ml) was injected into separate vials. Acetate was used because it is an
intermediate metabolite in hydrocarbon and lipid metabolism. Replicate
samples were incubated in the dark at 15 °C for 48 hours. Incubation was

Samples were acidified with 0.5 ml concentrated H2SO4

Chloroform (1 ml) was added to each sample to remove lab
from the atmosphere which could give false positive co

volatile hydrocarbons. 14CO2 was recovered by purging the

air and trapping the CO2 in 1 ml hyamine hydroxide
1974). Both the trapped 14CO2 and the chloroform extr
counted using Omnifluor (New England Nuclear) and a

100 counter. Counts of 14CO2 were corrected for backgro
counts obtained from the poisoned controls. Counts of
that were utilized were determined by subtracting th
chloroform extracts of active samples from the count
extracts of the poisoned controls. 14CO2 production (

available substrates.

Denitrification and Nitrogen Fixation Potential Activities

Denitrification in the gravel sediments was examined using the acetylene
blockage of N2O reduction technique (Balderson et al. 1976; Yoshinari et al.
1976). Nitrogen fixation was estimated by the acetylene reduction method
(Hardy et al. 1973). A 5 ml portion of a 1:10 diluted sediment sample was
added to a 20 ml glass vial containing 5 ml of either H2O, 0.05% KNO3, 0.25%

glucose, 0.05% KNO3 plus 0.25% glucose, or 0.05% KNO3 plus 0.25% Bacto
peptone plus 0.15% Bacto beef extract. Vials were sealed with rubber serum
stoppers and flushed with helium. Vials were injected with C2H2 generated
from CaC2 (Alpha Lux Company) to give a final concentration of 0.02 atm.
Vials were incubated in the dark at 15 °C for one week. Gas samples were
removed from the sample vials with 5 ml Vacutainer evacuated glass tubes
(Becton Dickinson) for later analysis. For gas analysis, 250 fx' of gas from the
vacutainer sub-samples were injected with a gas tight syringe (Glenco
Scientific) into a Hewlett Packard 5830 reporting gas Chromatograph equipped
with both a thermal conductivity detector for N2O and N2 analysis, and a dual
flame ionization detector for C2H2 and C2H4 analysis. Separation of gases was
achieved on a stainless steel column (6 m x 0.3 cm) packed with 50/80 mesh
Poropak Q (Waters Associates, Inc.). Operation was at 30 °C with a carrier
gas flow of 35 ml He/min. Integrated area response units were converted to /¿I

units by comparison with the area response of known concentrations of
standard gases.

Statistical Analysis

Analyses of variance were performed using the SPSS ANOVA procedure
(Nie et al. 1975). The Duncan's multiple range test option with an alpha value

of 0.05 was used in these analyses. Wherever the term "significant

differences" is used in this paper it refers to differences shown in these tests
to be significant at the 0.05 probability level.

RESULTS

Hydrocarbons in Sediment Samples

Gasoline hydrocarbons were found at all sampling sites. Hydrocarb

concentrations were not significantly different during the sampling per
sites C-L (Table 1). Hydrocarbon concentrations were significantly higher
site B than other sites. Gas Chromatographie analysis showed the presenc
compounds that co-chromatographed with the following standard compo
n-nonane, n-decane, m-xylene, naphthalene and 1 -methyl-naphthalene.
Concentrations of hydrocarbons increased during the sampling period at sites

K and L (Table 2). There was apparent movement of gasoline into this
previously uncontaminated area during this study. The application of fertilizer
did not affect the concentration of hydrocarbons in this newly contaminated
area. Fertilizer application did result in significantly lower concentrations of

hydrocarbons at site A compared to the unfertilized reference site B.
Hydrocarbon concentrations were significantly lower after the fourth

sampling time at sites A and B. During the sixth to ninth sampling time period
hydrocarbon concentrations were significantly lower at site A with fertilizers

than at reference site B. Sites A and B had been contaminated with higher
concentrations of gasoline for a much longer period of time than sites K and
L, allowing for adaptation of microbial populations.
Microbial Populations

The mean colony forming units showed that microbial populations were
higher at the highly contaminated sites A and B than at sites D, H and J
(Table 3). Populations were not significantly different in the fertilizer treated
site A and the reference site B. The ratios of gasoline utilizing and MOGAS

tolerant organisms (enumerated on media GA and BA-G) to viable
heterotrophs (enumerated on medium TGA) indicated that hydrocarbon
degrading bacterial populations had developed at sites A-J in response to the
presence of gasoline hydrocarbons (Table 4). All ratios were greater than 0.3.
Ratios for uncontaminated regions of this lake have been found previously to

be less than 0.002 (Horowitz and Atlas 1977). The presumptive counts of
denitrifiers showed no differences between any sites. The mean probable
number of denitrifiers was 3 x 106 CFU/g dry wt sediment.

Biodegradation Potential Activity Measurements

The hydrocarbon biodégradation potential activity measurements showed
that only small amounts of the labelled hydrocarbons were completely
mineralized to 14CO2 (Table 5). No significant utilization of toluene could be

measured. Decane and naphthalene utilization was greater at sites A and B
than at sites D, H and J. Fertilizer application to site A did not have any
significant effect on the hydrocarbon biodégradation potentials. Acetate was
more readily mineralized than any of the hydrocarbon substrates.

hydrocarbons have spread from t
in the sediment of the lake. Hyd

occassionally shown the presence of excessive concentrations of
hydrocarbons (G. Laursen, personal communication). An activated charcoal
filter has been installed to remove hydrocarbons from the drinking water.

The spread of hydrocarbons was directly measureable by gas

Chromatographie analyses and indirectly by monitoring microbial populations
in the sediment. Sites K and L were contaminated starting only one year after

the original spillage. These sites were originally selected as uncontaminated
controls. However, gasoline spread into this area during the study period. We

do not know whether sediment in any part of the lake remains
uncontaminated. We have not established yet whether transport of gasoline
across the lake is directly through the sediment or whether gasoline in low

concentrations moves across the water surface and is concentrated in the

shoreline sediment by adsorption.
The presence of gasoline resulted in changes in microbial populations and
metabolic activities. Numbers of hydrocarbon utilizing microorganisms were
high in sediment one year after spillage. Ratios of hydrocarbon utilizers to

viable heterotrophs showed the dominance of hydrocarbon utilizers in the
gasoline contaminated sediment. The relative occurrence of hydrocarbon
utilizers in the microbial community can be used to monitor the presence of
hydrocarbons in the environment.
Productivity of many Arctic ecosystems are nitrogen limited. Alterations in

microbial cycling of nitrogen can greatly change the ecologie balance.
Nitrogen fixation did not appear to be affected by the presence of gasoline
hydrocarbons or fertilizers. The assay system used, however, probably did
not measure nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria. It is difficult to determine
whether gasoline or fertilizers altered the rates of denitrification.
Denitrification could only be estimated as potential activities when NO3- and
carbon sources were added. Denitrification activity, measured with NO3alone added, could be interpreted as showing that prolonged exposure to
hydrocarbons results in increased rates of denitrification activity. Results with

A and B may have adapted to the presence of gasoline. Results in the
presence of glucose could be interpreted as showing that fertilizer application

enhances denitrification potential activity. It is likely that the presence of

nitrogen in peptones but not in glucose is the reason that different results were
obtained with the two carbon sources. Measurement of denitrification

potential activities in the presence of NO3- and added carbon is a valid model

of what occurs in a localized natural environmental niche when allochthonous
or autochthonous material enters the sediment. Factors that influence

environmental conditions, such as 02 tension, can greatly alter rates of
nitrogen cycling. Hydrocarbon contamination can result in greatly reduced
oxygen tension. Our interpretation of the measured denitrification activities is

that both gasoline contamination and fertilizer application altered potential

rates of denitrification under different conditions.

The hydrocarbon biodégradation potential activity measurements showed
differences in degradability of several hydrocarbons found in gasoline.
Toluene resisted biodégradation whereas decane and naphthalene were
degraded, although not extensively converted to CO2. Sites with the greatest
exposure to gasoline showed the greatest hydrocarbon biodégradation
activities. The biodégradation potential activities did not show any effect of
fertilizer apli cation. The biodégradation potential measurements were
performed in the presence of added nutrients, so that nitrogen and
phosphorous were not limiting during the assay period.

Fertilizer application did appear to increase in situ degradation of gasoline

hydrocarbons. Five weeks after fertilizer application hydrocarbon

concentrations in the fertilizer treated area were 10% of the concentrations in

the reference site. Further degradation may have been limited by oxygen
concentrations. Hydrocarbon concentrations decreased during the summer at
both sites A and B. Horizontal movement was restricted at these sites, but

vertical movement was not restricted. Fertilizer application and physical
collection from the heavily contaminated region should decrease further
movement of gasoline across the lake toward the drinking water inlet. The
hydrocarbon biodégradation potentials, which measure relative potential rates

of hydrocarbon degradation, failed to predict the differences in extent of
hydrocarbon degradation between fertilized and reference sites. Extent of
degradation may have been controlled by abiotic factors which were not
modelled in the hydrocarbon biodégradation potential measurements.
The problem of persistence from refined oil spillages in the Arctic remains.

Toxic light aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and naphthalene do not

evaporate when sorbed onto sediment particles. Even light fuels which would
rapidly evaporate in temperate regions can persist for long periods of time in

Arctic ecosystems. Microbial degradation of hydrocarbons is an active
process in Arctic ecosystems and can be stimulated by nutrient addition.
