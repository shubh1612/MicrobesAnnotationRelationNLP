Metagenomics has been successfully applied to isolate novel biocatalysts from diverse environments and
functional screening has been used as the primary technique to identify clones carrying the desired traits.
This work aimed at the construction and screening of a metagenomic library as a source of potential
hydrocarbon biodegraders. A library of 31000 clones was obtained from aerobic and anaerobic enrichments generated using a biodegraded petroleum sample collected at the Potiguar Basin in Brazil as an
inoculum. A total of 5000 clones were randomly selected for high throughput screening of hexadecane
biodegradation, revealing 72 positive hits. These were further evaluated using gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS), outstanding hexadecane biodegradation ability (>70%) being detected in ﬁve
clones.

1. Introduction
In the last few decades, the use of molecular biology methods
has drastically changed our perspective on microbial diversity in
nature, revealing that only a small fraction of microorganisms,
from 0.001% to 15% depending on the complexity of the environment under study, can be recovered using cultivation techniques
(Amann et al., 1995; Torsvik and vreås, 2002). In this context,
although diverse bacteria capable of degrading petroleum hydrocarbons have been isolated and characterized, the vast majority
of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, including anaerobes, probably
remain undiscovered (Harayama et al., 2004).
The major motivation of all researchers who study biodegradation is undoubtedly the search for versatile microorganisms capable of efﬁciently degrading a wide variety of pollutants at low
operational cost. It has been demonstrated, however, that some
hydrocarbon-derived compounds are unusually recalcitrant,
meaning that they are not metabolized by microorganisms or are
transformed into metabolites that can accumulate in the environment or are as toxic as the parent compound (Esteve-Nunez et al.,
2001). Furthermore, the degradation pathways of many pollutants
remain unknown or are poorly characterized due to re-isolation of

the same species when traditional cultivation methods are used to
recover pollutant-degrading microorganisms.
The study and exploration of genomes of the ‘‘uncultured
majority” has become possible through metagenomics, a cultureindependent molecular biology-based method that allows one to
explore the metabolic potential of uncultivated species by cloning
large DNA fragments isolated directly from the environment (Galvão et al., 2005; Suenaga et al., 2007).
Considering that the biocatalytic potential of only 1–2% of the
microorganisms in the world has been evaluated (Gomes and Steiner, 2004), metagenomic studies may offer a valuable tool for the
exploration of untapped microbial diversity. Recent studies conducted by screening metagenomic libraries from diverse environmental samples have already shown the huge biocatalytic
potential of diverse prokaryotes (Ferrer et al., 2005; Solbak et al.,
2005).
The use of metagenomics to gain access to the poorly
understood petroleum reservoir environment is innovative and may
reveal new enzymes (biocatalysts) of interest for biotechnological
processes such as bioremediation and microbial enhancement oil
recovery (MEOR).
Consequently, the present study was aimed at the construction
and screening of a metagenomic fosmid library from petroleum
microbial enrichments to identify efﬁcient hydrocarbon biodegraders.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sampling and geological settings
Oil samples were obtained in July 2008 from one production
well at the onshore Potiguar Basin (Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil)
with logistic support from CENPES/Petrobras. The sample,
GMR75, used as an inoculum for the microbial enrichments, was
classiﬁed as moderately biodegraded, with a biodegradation rank
of 4–5 according to the Peters and Moldowan (1993) scale
(Fig. 1). It was collected from a reservoir with an in situ temperature of 42.2 °C and at a depth of 535.5–540.5 m. The loss of hydrocarbons in natural reservoirs as a result of biodegradation is highly
variable in the Potiguar Basin; however, a recent study suggested
that the GMR oil has already lost more than 50% of its light hydrocarbons (Behar et al., 2006). The Potiguar Basin is located at the
Brazilian equatorial margin, covering an area of about
119,295 km2, with 33,200 km2 (27.8%) classiﬁed as onshore and
86,095 km2 as offshore at a water depth up to 3000 m. The basin
produces an average of 77,000 barrels of petroleum per day and
constitutes the third largest Brazilian petroleum producer (Lopes
et al., 1999 and references therein).
2.2. Microbial enrichments

2.3. DNA extraction
Community DNA was obtained from the aerobic and anaerobic
microbial enrichments using the protocols described by Grobkopf
et al. (1998) and Neria-Gonzáles et al. (2006) with modiﬁcations
reported by Silva et al. (2010).
2.4. Diversity analysis
The bacterial diversity of the aerobic and anaerobic enrichments was evaluated using 16S rRNA gene libraries. PCR ampliﬁcation of 16S rRNA genes was performed from total community DNA
by using the bacterial primer set 27f and 1100r (Lane, 1991).
Reaction mixtures (50 ll) contained 50–100 ng of total DNA, 2 U

Sample GMR75 was ﬁrst homogenized in a water bath at 50 °C.
For anaerobic enrichments, the cultures were grown in Schott bottles (1 l) containing 500 ml Widdel B mineral medium (Widdel
et al., 2006) supplemented with n-hexadecane or a non-biodegraded
oil sample, named P1, as carbon source. P1 oil was described
previously as a non-biodegraded sample from the Campos Basin
(Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Vasconcellos et al., 2009). Prior to inoculation in Widdel B mineral medium, P1 was autoclaved (30 min at
121 °C and 1 atm) and the n-hexadecane was sterilized by ﬁltration
through a 0.22 lm membrane (Millipore). Milled and autoclaved
shale (10 g) was added to the culture medium (250 ml in Schott
bottles) as a physical support for the improvement of microbial
growth, in an attempt to simulate the conditions in the petroleum
reservoirs. Trace elements (Widdel et al., 2006) were also added to
the medium and the whole system was purged by N2 ﬂow and

autoclaved for 20 min at 1 atm. Subsequently, the N2 atmosphere
was exchanged for N2/CO2 (70:30) and Na2CO3 (5 m, 10%) and vitamin solution (5 ml) were added (Zinder et al., 1984). Finally, a cysteine–HCl solution (2 mM) was added (1%, v/v) as a ﬁnal electron
acceptor. Hexadecane or non-biodegraded oil (P1) was applied as
a substrate (5 ml) for the recovery of microbiota in the biodegraded
oil (GMR75) used as an inoculum (50 ml). The anaerobic enrichments were developed in four replicates, incubated at 55 °C for
120 days and monitored for cell density with turbidimetric analysis (MacFarland scale) and for sulfate reduction according to
Kolmert et al. (2000). This standard turbidimetric method is based
on the precipitation of sulfate ions in the medium with BaCl2,
affording BaSO4.
Bushnell Haas (BH) mineral medium (Eriksson et al., 2000; Sette
et al., 2007) was used for the aerobic enrichments. The pH of the
medium was adjusted to 7.0 and 200 ml aliquots were distributed
into Schott bottles (1 l). Shale was added (10 g) and the bottles
were autoclaved at 1 atm for 20 min. After sterilization, vitamin
solution (Zinder et al., 1984) and 1 ml of hexadecane (0.5% v/v)
were added to the medium, followed by inoculation with 10 ml
of GMR75 oil (5% v/v) diluted in Tween 80 (1:1; Sette et al.,
2007). The enrichments were developed in ﬁve replicates and incubated on an orbital shaker (100 rpm) for 30 days. Microbial growth
was monitored for cell density via turbidimetric analysis (MacFarland scale).

Taq DNA polymerase (InvitrogenÒ), 1X Taq buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
0.2 mM dNTP mix (GE Healthcare) and 0.4 lM each primer. The
PCR ampliﬁcation was done using an initial denaturation step at
95 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at
55 °C and 3 min at 72 °C and a ﬁnal extension step at 72 °C for
3 min using an Eppendorf thermal cycler. Two libraries were
constructed, one for each enrichment. Ampliﬁed ribossomal DNA
restriction analysis (ARDRA) and phylogenetic afﬁliations were
performed as described by Sette et al. (2007). The 16S rDNA partial
sequences determined were deposited at the GenBank database
under the accession numbers HM059724 to HM059788.
2.5. Construction of metagenomic clone library
2.5.1. DNA preparation
DNA samples representing aerobic and anaerobic enrichments
were pooled and submitted to electrophoresis (400 ll) in a low
melting point agarose gel (1%) for size selection (35–45 kb). After
pulsed ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (BIORAD CHEF DRIIÒ) at
200 V (6 V cm 1) for 4 h at 14 °C, with an initial switch time of
5 s and a ﬁnal switch time of 15 s, a strip from each side of the
gel was cut off and stained to localize the DNA. A high molecular
weight marker (Low Range PFG Marker, New England BiolabsÒ)
(0.5 ll), a fosmid DNA control (EpicentreÒ) (1 ll) and an aliquot
of the pooled DNA (4 ll) were used as references to select the region of interest. DNA-containing regions were cut from the rest
of the gel (unstained), transferred to microtubes containing 0.5%
TAE (tris–acetate–EDTA) and treated with gelase (1 U/ll of DNA).
2.5.2. Library construction
The fosmid clone library was constructed using the CloningReady Copy Control pCC2FOS kit (EpicentreÒ) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. After the end-repair reaction
of the insert ends, ca. 40 lg of the DNA mixture (aerobic and anaerobic) was ligated, packed and transfected into Escherichia coli
EPI300 cells. Clones were replicated in 96-well microtiter plates
with LB medium containing 20% glycerol and stored at 80 °C.
For validation of the metagenomic library, six clones were randomly selected and grown under appropriate conditions, and fosmid DNA was extracted using a FosmidMax DNA Puriﬁcation kit
(EpicentreÒ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The fosmids were digested with the enzyme NotI (PromegaÒ), and their
restriction proﬁles were checked on a 1% agarose gel using pulsed
ﬁeld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (CHEF-DR II, BIORADÒ) at 6 V cm 1
for 6 h, with a switch of 5–15.
2.6. Rapid screening for detection of microbial growth on hexadecane
The screening assays were developed according to methodology
described by Johnsen et al. (2002) with some modiﬁcations. Hexadecane was chosen as a model compound to evaluate the ability of
the fosmid clones to grow using it as sole carbon source. Clones
were pre-cultured in microplates (96 wells) containing 150 ll LB
broth added of chloramphenicol (12.5 ll/ml) and incubated at
37 °C on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) for 24 h. After growth, aliquots
(15 ll) of the clone cultures were transferred to another microplate
ﬁlled with 150 ll BH medium containing chloramphenicol
(12.5 lg/ml) and hexadecane (1.5 ll), which was pre-sterilized
by ﬁltration through a 0.22 lM Millipore membrane. E. coli EPI
300 and Micrococcus sp. (CBMAI 636; Vasconcellos et al., 2009)
were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. After
48 h incubation at 37 °C on a rotary shaker (150 rpm), 30 ll MTT
[3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2 H-tetrazolium bromide] (MerckÒ) solution (1 mg/ml) was added to each well to evaluate microbial respiration and consequent hexadecane
consumption. The microplates were incubated again at 37 °C for

677

1 h. The generation of a purple color was considered to be a positive hit, while a yellow color was indicative of the absence of cellular activity (Bicalho et al., 2003).
2.7. GC–MS analysis of hexadecane biodegradation
Clones with positive growth using hexadecane as sole carbon
source were evaluated for their biodegradation ability using chromatographic analysis. Clones were pre-cultured in pools (nine
clones per pool), and 1 ml aliquots were inoculated in Erlenmeyer
ﬂasks containing 500 ml of LB added of chloramphenicol (12.5 ll/
ml), followed by incubation on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at
37 °C for 24 h. The cells were centrifuged (5000 rpm, 20 min,
4 °C) and the pellet was washed twice with distilled water. The
pools were suspended in ultrapure water at 108 CFU/m. Erlenmeyer
ﬂasks (125 ml) containing 40 ml BH mineral medium with
chloramphenicol (12.5 ll/ml) were inoculated with 400 ll hexadecane, 40 ll vitamin solution (Zinder et al., 1984) and 4 ml of
the cellular suspension (each pool of nine clones). The assays were
run with ﬁve replicates and monitored for 28 days using GC–MS.
Doubly distilled hexane was used as extraction solvent for the
organic phase in the chromatographic analysis. Phenanthrene
solution (0.5 mg/ml) was applied as internal standard. GC–MS
conditions are described by Vasconcellos et al. (2009). The clones
in pools showing signiﬁcant hydrocarbon degradation were evaluated individually using the same protocols as described above.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Microbial enrichments
Slices of shale were used in the microbial enrichments in an attempt to simulate the physical conditions existing in petroleum
reservoirs and improve the growth of the microorganisms in the
petroleum samples. The technique of microbial cell immobilization
is widely used to increase biomass in anaerobic reactors (Silva
et al., 2006), although the choice of an ideal support is a limiting
factor in the selection of microbial populations. In this study, the
microbial enrichments were developed using hexadecane or a
non-biodegraded petroleum sample (P1) as carbon source, with
the goal of recovering microorganisms that might be involved in
hydrocarbon biodegradation. Shale was not chosen randomly as a
support for microbial growth and increased DNA recovery. Previous enrichment assays using different matrices have shown that
the use of shale afforded the highest level of DNA recovery (data
not shown). After 120 days monitoring, intense biomass generation was observed. with a cellular density higher >108 CFU/ml for
both substrates (hexadecane and P1). The same microbial enrichments showed up to 69% sulfate reduction, suggesting the presence
of sulfate-reducing bacteria in both enrichments.
3.2. DNA extraction
Total DNA extraction was successful for both aerobic and
anaerobic enrichments, affording high molecular weight DNA
(up to 40 kb) at P50 ng/ll for the aerobic enrichment and
P100 ng/ll for the anaerobic enrichment (Fig. 2).
The use of hexadecane as a substrate in the anaerobic enrichment was more efﬁcient for the recovery of hydrocarbon-biodegrading bacteria than the enrichment using P1 oil and resulted in
a larger amount of DNA recovered (Fig. 2). In contrast, no difference
in DNA yield was observed in the aerobic enrichment using hexadecane or P1 oil. DNA samples obtained using both carbon sources
were pooled and used for diversity analysis. For the construction of
the metagenomic library, DNA samples from both the aerobic and
anaerobic enrichments were pooled and treated as a single sample.

3.3. Diversity analysis
The bacterial diversity of the aerobic (AER) and anaerobic (ANA)
enrichments was evaluated by analysis of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. A total of 96 clones from the AER library and 91 from the
ANA library were screened by ARDRA to select different ribotypes
for subsequent sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Combined
data from ARDRA and sequencing revealed that the bacterial members represented in the 16S rDNA library from the aerobic enrichment were afﬁliated (78%) with the genera Petrobacter (Phylum
Proteobacteria, Class Betaproteobacteria) and (22%) Micromonospora/Verrucosispora (Phylum Actinobacteria) (Table 1, Fig. 3).
The anaerobic microbiota represented in the 16S rDNA library
from the biodegraded petroleum sample were more diverse, and
the bacterial members were related to the genera Flexistipes
(24%) (Phylum Deferribacteres), Thermodesulfovibrio (20%) (Phylum
Nitrospirae), Petrotoga (15.4%) (Phylum Thermotogae), Anaerobaculum (2.2%) (Phylum Synergistetes) and Rahnella (38.4%) (Phylum
Proteobacteria, Class Gammaproteobacteria) (Table 1, Fig. 3).
Most of bacterial genera found in the aerobic and anaerobic
enrichments had been described in the literature as inhabitants
of petroleum-associated environments (Nazina et al., 2006; Miranda-Tello et al., 2007). A bacterium of the genus Petrobacter, the
most abundant in the aerobic enrichment (Table 1; Fig. 3), was recently isolated from a non-water ﬂooded Australian terrestrial oil
reservoir and described as a novel nitrate-reducing bacterium
and moderately thermophilic (Salinas et al., 2004). The reservoir

characteristics described by Salinas and collaborators (2004) are
actually very similar to those of the reservoir sampled in this study.
The genera Micromonospora and Verrucosispora, also recovered
from the aerobic enrichment, belong to the Order Actinomycetales
and are phylogenetically closely related (Rheims et al., 1998). Ara
and Kudo (2007) described Micromonospora spp. as being widely
distributed in marine environments, sediments, soils and extreme
sites such as Antarctica. These bacteria were also described as
being capable of using hydrocarbons as sole carbon source (Vidal
et al., 1999), corroborating the ﬁndings of the present work.
Flexistipes and Petrotoga-related clones recovered in the anaerobic enrichments (Table 1; Fig. 3) have also been reported as commonly occurring groups in petroleum reservoirs. Flexistipes is a
metal-reducing microorganism that reduces a variety of metals
in metabolic processes coupled to the oxidation of organic compounds in petroleum accumulations (Yacob, 2000). The genus Petrotoga, together with the genera Geotoga and Thermotoga, belong to
the order Thermotogales and are described as thermophilic microorganisms occurring exclusively in petroleum reservoirs (MirandaTello et al., 2007). Thermodesulfovibrio spp. were described by Nazina and co-workers (2006) as an indigenous sulfate reducing group
in the microbiota of the Dagang Oilﬁeld (China). In this sense, the
recovery of these bacteria in the anaerobic enrichment may suggest that they are native members of the microbial community in
the Potiguar Basin reservoirs. The genus Anaerobaculum was ﬁrst
isolated from a petroleum reservoir and characterized as being
comprised of Gram-negative, anaerobic, thermophilic, fermentative bacteria involved in organic acid degradation processes (Rees
et al., 1997). The data are consistent with the recovery of Anaerobaculum spp. in the anaerobic enrichment cultivated under thermophilic conditions and inoculated with crude oil derived from
the Potiguar Basin reservoirs, which are known for their high organic acid content (Lopes et al., 1999). Finally, community analysis
also showed the recovery of Rahnella-related species in the anaerobic enrichment. Although not commonly described in petroleum
environments, these bacteria are reported as being involved in
hydrocarbon biodegradation in Antarctic soil contaminated with
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; Ma et al., 2006).

3.4. Construction and screening of metagenomic clone library
A fosmid metagenomic library was constructed using a mixture
of the total DNA recovered from the aerobic and anaerobic enrichments, affording 31000 clones representing the bacterial diversity

different band proﬁles, conﬁrming the presence of different
insertion events and the potential for the fosmid library to be
representative of the bacterial diversity found in the enrichments.

Based on strategies in the literature, a rapid colorimetric
screening test was established for the detection of bacterial
growth in hexadecane as sole carbon source (Johnsen et al.,
2002; Bicalho et al., 2003). In this sense, 5000 clones were randomly chosen and screened using high throughput assays. Results
revealed 72 positive hits detected by way of the development of a
violet color resulting from the oxidation of MTT (Bicalho et al.,
2003). The potential of these clones to use hexadecane as a sole
carbon source was considered to be indicative of their degradation ability.
3.5. GC–MS analysis for detection of hexadecane biodegradation
The biodegradation activity of the 72 clones considered to be
positive hits from the high throughput screening was evaluated
using GC–MS. These clones were ﬁrst investigated in pools, and
hexadecane was again used as the model compound. It is present
in the aliphatic fraction of crude oil and is one of the major
components of diesel (Chénier et al., 2003). As an n-alkane, it has
been used as a model compound to study aliphatic hydrocarbon
biodegradation by many authors (Berthe-Corti and Fetzner, 2002;
Schoefs et al., 2004; Widdel et al., 2006).
Among the eight pools evaluated (nine clones per pool), only
one (CO8) showed biodegradation levels >50%. Three other pools
did not show any biodegradation ability and the remaining four

pools showed hexadecane biodegradation levels up to 28%. The
CO8 pool was selected for biodegradation assays using GC–MS,
and the clones were evaluated individually. GC–MS showed that
ﬁve of the nine clones were able to degrade hexadecane by >70%
after 21 days monitoring (Table 2; Fig. 4). It is important to note
that the results refer to clones, which constitute a heterologous
expression system in E. coli cells. In this sense, the extent of
biodegradation observed can be considered excellent when compared to data in the literature on the biodegradation abilities of
bacterial strains. Whyte et al. (1998) reported a Rhodococcus strain
that showed a hexadecane biodegradation level of 6.1% after
102 days incubation. In another study, Ripley et al. (2000)
developed systems for the immobilization of Pseudomonas and
Acinetobacter cells and observed hexadecane biodegradation levels
between 33% and 51%. An evaluation of the hexadecane
biodegradation and emulsiﬁcation abilities of a Pseudomonas
aeruginosa strain under different experimental conditions revealed
a biodegradation level of 11% after 3 days monitoring (Noordman
et al., 2002). Furthermore, Vasconcellos et al. (2009) recently
evaluated the biodegradation of different classes of petroleum
biomarkers using aerobic strains isolated from the Campos Basin
reservoir and found biodegradation levels <70% when only hydrocarbons were added as a carbon source. All these data conﬁrm the
signiﬁcant results obtained in the present work using fosmid
clones bearing catabolic genes from a petroleum reservoir, which
were shown to successfully express hexadecane biodegradation
ability in E. coli host cells.
Investigation of the biodegradation ability of the ﬁve clones
is being extended and other biomarkers (e.g. phenanthrene,
naphthalene, dodecane and tetradecane), complex mixtures of
hydrocarbons and crude petroleum are being tested as substrates.
Additionally, sub-cloning assays are being conducted to identify
which catabolic pathways responsible for hydrocarbon degradation
are present in the petroleum reservoirs of the Potiguar Basin.

4. Conclusions
This is the ﬁrst report of the construction of a metagenomic
clone library from a Brazilian petroleum reservoir sample. The
clones that showed excellent hexadecane biodegradation ability
(>70%) are undergoing genomic and proteomic investigations to
unravel the biodegradation routes that occur in petroleum-associated environments. The results of the present work demonstrate
the potential of a metagenomic approach for prospecting the
microbial diversity in hostile environments such as petroleum reservoirs in the search for biocatalysts for use in biotechnological and
industrial processes.
