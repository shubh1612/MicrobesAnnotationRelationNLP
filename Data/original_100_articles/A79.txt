Soils contaminated with mineral oil hydrocarbons are often cleaned in off-site bioremediation
systems. In order to find out which bacteria are active during the degradation phase in such
systems, the diversity of the active microflora in a degrading soil remediation system was
investigated by small-subunit (SSU) rRNA analysis. Two sequential RNA extracts from one soil
sample were generated by a procedure incorporating bead beating. Both extracts were analysed
separately by generating individual SSU rDNA clone libraries from cDNA of the two extracts. The
sequencing results showed moderate diversity. The two clone libraries were dominated by
Gammaproteobacteria, especially Pseudomonas spp. Alphaproteobacteria and
Betaproteobacteria were two other large groups in the clone libraries. Actinobacteria, Firmicutes,
Bacteroidetes and Epsilonproteobacteria were detected in lower numbers. The obtained
sequences were predominantly related to genera for which cultivated representatives have been
described, but were often clustered together in the phylogenetic tree, and the sequences that
were most similar were originally obtained from soils and not from pure cultures. Most of the
dominant genera in the clone libraries, e.g. Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas,
Acidovorax and Thiobacillus, had already been detected in (mineral oil hydrocarbon) contaminated
environmental samples. The occurrence of the genera Zymomonas and Rhodoferax was novel in
mineral oil hydrocarbon-contaminated soil.

INTRODUCTION
The contamination of soils with mineral oil hydrocarbons is
a widespread environmental problem. Strictly speaking,
mineral oil hydrocarbons are not xenobiotic, but their largescale use and various applications lead in many cases to
environmental contamination (Gallego et al., 2001). Such
contamination may be a consequence of petroleum
transport, storage and refining, or accidents (Juteau et al.,
2003). Soil is an environmental compartment which is
renewable only within long time periods, or even not
renewable at all. Therefore, it is important to protect soil
from such contamination or to clean contaminated soils.
After treatment, the soil should be usable, at least for

applications with a low purity requirement, such as road
construction or the recultivation of industrial areas.
One possibility for cleaning such soils is bioremediation
(Juteau et al., 2003), which aims at the biological
mineralization of organic compounds to CO2 and water,
or at least at transformation to less-toxic or innocuous
forms (Plaza et al., 2003). The success of biodegradation
depends on the predominant environmental conditions, on
the chemical structure of the pollutants, on the bioavailability of the contaminating compounds, and thus on the
interaction between pollutant, soil matrix and microorganisms (Del’Arco & de França, 2001; Volkering et al.,
1998). Another problem of contaminated sites is the wide
variety of mineral oil hydrocarbons (Li et al., 2004).
There are many known consortia of micro-organisms
which are able to degrade mineral oil hydrocarbons under
laboratory or field conditions (Ratajczak et al., 1998;
Wikström et al., 1996). However, a single bacterium usually
has only a relatively small degradation range, and thus not all
fractions of the mineral oil hydrocarbon can be degraded by
a single species (Mishra et al., 2001). Consequently, the use
of a laboratory strain to clean a contaminated soil is usually

not successful. In addition to the restricted substrate range,
such a strain is not necessarily adapted to the particular
environmental conditions, such as temperature, and the
availability of water, O2 and nutrients.
Rarely, contamination occurs suddenly (e.g. by tanker
accidents or explosions), but more often creeping contamination occurs. A pipeline, or a storage tank at a petrol
station, may leak for many years and contaminate the
surrounding soil, and thus a degrading indigenous microflora can develop and adapt to the use of the pollutants as a
carbon and energy source. For this reason, the naturally
occurring microflora is often used for the degradation of
mineral oil hydrocarbons (Watanabe, 2001).
In practice, a variety of methods is used for the
bioremediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, with
off-site remediation being the most important remediation
strategy. Often the soil is ventilated, and a mineral fertilizer
may be added at the beginning of or during the treatment.
During the bioremediation process in such systems, the
temperature of the soil may increase (Condé & Hagedorn,
1997), which reflects the activity of the indigenous
microflora using the mineral oil hydrocarbons as a carbon
and energy source.
For better control of such a bioremediation system, it may
be helpful to know which micro-organisms actually bring
about the biodegradation. Various methods have been used
to analyse the microbial diversity in mineral oil hydrocarbon-contaminated soils. One method is the cultivation of
bacteria (Chao & Hsu, 2004; Greene et al., 2000; La Rosa
et al., 2006; Plaza et al., 2003; Radwan et al., 1995; Saul et al.,
2005), but it has been estimated that only ~1 % of soil
micro-organisms can be cultivated by conventional methods (Torsvik et al., 1990). The established cultivation
methods favour the isolation of fast-growing microorganisms, and those that accept high nutrient concentrations (Felske et al., 1999). Thus, for diversity analyses,
cultivation-independent methods are more reliable. Earlier
studies have described the mineral oil hydrocarbondegrading community at the small subunit (SSU) rDNA
level in soils (Juck et al., 2000; Saul et al., 2005), in a
biodegradation system (Kaplan & Kitts, 2004), in coastal
material (Macnaughton et al., 1999) or in soils treated in
bioreactors (Mills et al., 2003). SSU rDNA reflects both
active and inactive micro-organisms, and thus the genetic
potential rather than the active portion of a microbial
community (Lüdemann et al., 2000). The active community
in a bioremediation system may be characterized by
investigation of SSU rRNA, because the latter is directly
involved in active protein synthesis (Morgan et al., 2002). In
addition, after release from lysed bacterial cells into the soil,
chemical degradation of rRNA is relatively fast, and thus
rRNA does not remain intact in the soil, while SSU rDNA is
more stable (Trevors, 1996). An investigation has been
reported of the metabolically active members of a bacterial
community in a polychlorinated biphenyl-polluted soil with
no degrading activity (Nogales et al., 1999). But, to our
3292

knowledge, SSU rRNA analyses of mineral oil hydrocarbondegrading communities have so far not been described in the
literature. Degrading micro-organisms should be particularly active in phases of temperature increase in the system.
Thus, in the present study, a sample from the ‘hot’ stage of
a bioremediation system was investigated by SSU rRNA
analysis to show which micro-organisms were active in this
degradation stage.

METHODS
Soil samples. Soil samples were obtained from a bioremediation

system for material from a contaminated site at Rositz, a village in
Thuringia, Germany, where a tar factory was processing brown coal
tar between 1917 and 1990. The factory was destroyed in World
War II, and the destruction of the factory accounts for much of the
contamination of the soil in this area. The contamination consisted
of alkanes, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX), polyaromatic compounds, as well as phenols (Verwaltungs- und
Verwertungsgesellschaft Industriegelände Rositz, 1998), which had
remained on-site for more than 60 years.
The soil had a silty and partially loamy structure, and the pH was
almost neutral. There were only marginal amounts of organic matter,
as the excavated material contained only minor portions of the upper
soil horizons. The bioremediation heap Rositz 3 was composed of 700 t
mineral oil-contaminated soil material (8000 milligrams mineral oil
per kilogram soil dry weight), with an area of 60 m2 and a height of
3?5 m. Mineral fertilizer (nitrogen : phosphate : potassium, 15 : 15 : 15)
had initially been added at 0?5 t per 1000 t soil. The bioremediation
heap Rositz 3 was permanently ventilated by extracting soil air from the
heap through a system of suction tubes and thereby providing fresh air
from the environment (Condé & Hagedorn, 1997).
At the time point at which according to chemical analyses the
concentration of mineral oil hydrocarbons had dropped to less than
6000 milligrams per kilogram soil dry weight, and at which the
temperature inside the heap had increased from 12 to 21 uC within
43 days, the heap was considered to contain an actively degrading
microflora, and a sample was taken for the analysis of bacterial
diversity. The sampling of bioremediation system Rositz 3 took place
on 24 April 2002. The temperature inside the heap (21 uC) was 10 uC
above the ambient air temperature on that day. The sample was
collected at a central point with a special drill for manual soil sampling
from a height of 1?5 m and 0?75 m into the system. The soil material
was put into a 50 ml reaction tube and frozen at 280 uC.
Nucleic acid extraction. For the simultaneous extraction of RNA

and DNA from the soil sample, the method of Görres (2001) was
used in a modified form. This nucleic acid extraction method allows
the separation of the nucleic acid extract into sequential fractions,
and thus provides the possibility of performing a differential analysis. The first extract may contain the nucleic acids of micro-organisms which are easy to lyse or located outside soil particles. The
subsequent extracts may contain nucleic acids of the less-accessible
organisms.
Soil (0?5–1 g) was transferred into a 2 ml reaction tube with 0?5 g glass
beads of 0?1–0?25 mm diameter (Roth). Then, 750 ml 120 mM sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 8) and 500 ml phenol/chloroform : isoamyl
alcohol (25 : 24 : 1 by volume) were added. The tubes were placed
into a bead beater (MM200; Retsch) for 2 min at 26?6 rounds s21. To
separate the aqueous and organic phases, the tubes were centrifuged at
12 000 g for 5 min. The aqueous layers were transferred to a fresh 2 ml
reaction tube and stored on ice. This tube contained the first nucleic
acid extract. The brown phenol/chloroform layer was removed from

the tube with the soil/bead mixture and discarded. Five hundred
microlitres of the sodium phosphate buffer and 500 ml fresh phenol/
chloroform : isoamyl alcohol were added to the soil/bead mixture, and
the bead-beating procedure was repeated. The aqueous phases were
transferred into a fresh 2 ml reaction tube and stored on ice (second
extract). The extraction step was repeated once again, and the aqueous
phase from this step was combined with the aqueous phase from the
second extraction. Further treatment of this second/third extract was
separate from that of the first nucleic acid extract.
The preparations were extracted three times with 1 ml phenol/
chloroform : isoamyl alcohol. Nucleic acids were precipitated by
adding solutions of 5 M NaCl and 30 % (w/v) PEG 6000 at a ratio
of sample : salt : PEG 6000 of 9 : 1 : 10 (by volume). The mixtures were
left at room temperature for 2 h. To pellet the nucleic acids, the tubes
were centrifuged at 12 000 g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatants
were discarded. The nucleic acid pellets were washed with 500 ml 80 %
(v/v) ethanol, centrifuged at 12 000 g for 5 min, and the ethanol was
removed. This step was repeated once. The pellets were dried at room
temperature for about 30 min, and the nucleic acids were resuspended
in 50 ml deionized water and stored at 220 uC.
The nucleic acids were visualized by a urea denaturing 4?5 %
polyacrylamide gel and ethidium bromide staining. Bands of DNA,
as well as SSU rRNA and large subunit (LSU) rRNA, were visible when
2?5 ml of the extract was loaded onto the gel. Quantification of several
extracts of the same material showed that there was about twice as
much RNA in the first extract as in the second/third extract.

The RT-PCR products were visualized by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Bands of RT-PCR products
were excised from the agarose gels and DNA was isolated with an
EasyPure DNA Purification kit (Biozym).
Cloning and screening of RT-PCR products. RT-PCR products

were ligated into a T-vector (Marchuk et al., 1991), which was prepared from EcoRV-digested pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene). The
transformation into competent Escherichia coli DH5a (Gibco-BRL)
was performed by electroporation using an EquiBio device (peqlab
Biotechnologie) and the standard protocol for transformation of E.
coli described in the EquiBio optimization guide. The cell suspensions were plated onto Luria–Bertani (LB) medium (1 % tryptone,
0?5 % yeast extract, 1 % NaCl, 1?5 % agar) with 50 mg ampicillin
ml21, and the clones were screened by blue–white detection
(Sambrook & Russell, 2001).
White clones were screened for inserts by large-scale colony screening
(Campbell & Choy, 2001). Extraction of the plasmid DNA from liquid
cultures was performed using the FlexiPrep kit (Amersham
Biosciences), and the bound plasmid DNA was eluted with deionized
water and stored at 220 uC. Clones from the first bead treatment were
named Rositz1 Roxx and clones from the second/third bead treatment
were named Rositz23 Rosxx, where xx indicates the clone number in
the respective library.
The final test for inserts of expected size was by PvuII digestion of the
plasmid DNA.

Separation of RNA and DNA. Separation of RNA and DNA was

DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Sequencing was

performed with the nucleic-acid-binding silica spin-columns of an
Invisorb TwinSpin Cell Mini kit (Invitek), using the buffers supplied
by the manufacturer. The manufacturer’s protocol was modified at
some points: Lysis Solution T, which is meant to lyse cells, was
added to the nucleic acid extracts from soil to obtain the optimal
reaction conditions for the spin columns. At the end of the procedure, the elutions of RNA and DNA from the respective binding
spin filters were carried out twice. The DNA extracts were stored at
4 uC for later use in another study.

done on a LI-COR 4200 IR sequencer using the CycleReader Auto
DNA Sequencing kit (MBI Fermentas) with labelled primer T3 (59CGCGCAATTAACCCTCACTAAAG-39; Stratagene). The following
programme was employed: initial denaturation for 2 min at 92 uC,
followed by 25 cycles (30 s at 92 uC, 30 s at 55 uC and 1 min at
72 uC).

To further purify the RNA extracts, traces of DNA were digested with
60 U RNase-free DNase I (Roche) in the enzyme-specific buffer
(10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7?5, 2?5 mM MgCl2, 0?1 mM CaCl2; Ambion)
at 37 uC for 2 h. DNase I was removed by phenol extraction and
ethanol precipitation (Moore, 1987). The RNA extracts were stored at
220 uC. The success of the DNase I digestion was checked by SSU
rDNA PCR, from which no PCR product could be visualized by 1 %
agarose gel electrophoresis.
Amplification of SSU rRNA by RT-PCR. The SSU rRNA was

used as template for amplification of the corresponding cDNA by
RT-PCR using a TGradient Thermocycler (Whatman Biometra).
The primers 27F, 59-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-39, and 519R,
59-G(TA)ATTACCGCGGC(GT)GCTG-39 (obtained from MWG
Biotech), target most bacterial SSU rRNAs (Lane, 1991). The RTPCR reactions were prepared following the instructions of the
GeneAmp EZ rTth RNA PCR kit (Perkin Elmer-Applied
Biosystems). The 50 ml reaction mixture contained the kit components and final concentrations of 0?25 mM each primer, 0?1 mg BSA
ml21 (MBI Fermentas) and 1 ml RNA extract. Negative controls were
prepared without RNA extract. The rTth DNA polymerase, which is
able to perform both the reverse transcription step and the amplification step (PCR), was added to the reactions after 1 min at 60 uC.
The following PCR programme was used: 30 min at 60 uC (reverse
transcription), initial denaturation for 2 min at 94 uC, 40 cycles
(1 min at 94 uC, 30 s at 55 uC, 45 s at 72 uC), terminal elongation
for 7 min at 72 uC, indefinitely at 15 uC (modified from the instructions of the GeneAmp EZ rTth RNA PCR kit).

Sequence analysis was performed using the programs e-Seq (LI-COR)
and EditSeq (DNASTAR; Lasergene). The most similar SSU rRNA
sequences were identified using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990). Using the
Chimera Check tool of the Ribosomal Database Project II, the obtained
sequences were tested for potential chimeric sequences (Cole et al.,
2003). The ARB software was applied for the phylogenetic analysis of
sequences (Ludwig et al., 2004). Initial alignment was done by the ARB
fast aligner, and then manual verifications and corrections were
necessary. At first, a main tree including reference sequences of the
taxonomic group of interest was calculated with the maximumlikelihood method and the respective taxonomic filter, which included
only positions that are conserved among at least 50 % of the sequences
in the respective taxonomic group. After this, the Rositz sequences were
added to the tree with the parsimony method without changing the tree
topology and applying the respective filter. Finally, an outgroup was
defined and added to the tree with the parsimony method by applying
the universal bacterial filter. In some cases, many sequences were
very similar to each other, and were therefore grouped together. Such a
group was named with the representative species name, and the
numbers of corresponding Rositz sequences were specified in
parentheses.
Representative sequences obtained in this study were submitted to the
EMBL database and can be retrieved under accession numbers
AM237215–AM237284, AM279418, AM279419, and AM237445–
AM237448 (partial sequences from chimeras).
Estimated phylotype diversity and comparison of clone

for a P test (Martin, 2002) of the two libraries. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined based on a 3 % distance cut-off,

and clone groups were calculated by DOTUR (Schloss & Handelsman,
2005). To avoid misassignments due to small overlaps of partial
sequences in conserved regions, the sequence parts from chimeras
were manually assigned to OTUs. The resulting OTU indices were
transformed into abundance tables for FST-based comparison
(Slatkin, 1991) in Arlequin 3.0 (Excoffier et al., 2005), and for calculation of richness estimators and assemblage comparison in SPADE
(Chao & Shen, 2003).

RESULTS
Construction of SSU rRNA library
The aim of this study was the characterization of the active
bacterial community in the bioremediation system Rositz 3
degrading mineral oil hydrocarbons. Therefore, a sample
was taken during the active period of the heap and was
subjected to rRNA-based sequencing analysis. The amplification of about 480 nucleotide fragments of bacterial SSU
rRNA was performed for the extract of the first bead
treatment and separately for the extract of the second/third
bead treatment to investigate the effect of the sequential
extraction. In total, 221 clones were analysed, 110 from the
first and 111 from the second/third bead treatments,
respectively. All clones were sequenced over their full
lengths.
Eight sequences were assumed to be chimeras according to
the results of the Chimera Check program (Cole et al., 2003).
These sequences were split into two parts at the specified
position, and the two parts were handled separately for the
next steps of the analysis. In most cases, full-length
sequences of at least one of the two sequences were available
in other clones. Only those short sequences for which no
full-length counterpart was available in the clone libraries
were submitted to the databases. For example, the
Alcaligenes sequence Rositz1 Ro44a (AM237448) formed a
chimera with part of a Methylobacterium sequence in the
full-length sequence Rositz1 Ro74. Furthermore, the
Hydrocarboniphaga-related Rositz1 Ro78a (AM237447)
formed a chimera with a portion of Betaproteobacterium
Rositz1 Ro35 (AM237265). A total of 112 sequences from

library Rositz1 and 110 sequences from Rositz23 were
included in the analyses.
Statistics
Richness estimation resulted in an ACE (abundance-based
coverage estimator) of 236 OTUs in the Rositz1 library and
160 OTUs in the Rositz23 library. The numbers of observed
OTUs (cut-off 3 % distance) within the clone libraries were
67 in Rositz1 and 59 in Rositz23. Shannon–Weaver indices
of the two libraries were calculated as 3?925 and 3?782,
respectively. Sample coverage was 0?563 for Rositz1 and
0?636 for Rositz23.
A P test (Martin, 2002) was done using a parsimonycalculated dendrogram of all Rositz sequences. The
parsimony dendrogram had a score of 59, at which the
cumulative frequency of the random trees was 0?031
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Analysis of differentiation,
which was based on abundance data of OTUs at the 3 %
cut-off, was also significant, although the FST was quite
low (FST=0?00505, P<0?00001). Abundance-based
Jaccard (Ĵabd) and Sorensen (Ŝabd) estimates (Chao et al.,
2005) were 0?7382 (variance 0?1900) and 0?8494 (0?1341),
respectively.
Phylogenetic distribution of clones at the
phylum and subphylum level: predominance of
Gammaproteobacteria
For a first phylogenetic assignment, sequences were
compared to the database with the BLAST program,
which showed the following phylogenetic distribution
(Table 1). Proteobacteria dominated in both clone libraries.
Gammaproteobacteria represented the main group. Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria occurred with
about the same frequency in the clone libraries, but made
up only one third of the numbers of Gammaproteobacteria.
Epsilonproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and
Firmicutes were detected at lower levels. Such lesscommon sequences occurred at somewhat higher levels in
the extract from the second/third bead treatment.

Microbial diversity in a bioremediation system

The dominating group among the Gammaproteobacteria was
the genus Pseudomonas (Fig. 1a, b), but there was no clear
association to one Pseudomonas species. The Rositz
sequences were distributed rather evenly within the genus.
One of the largest groups was the Pseudomonas anguilliseptica group within the P. aeruginosa lineage. Many of the
other Rositz sequences clustered in the Pseudomonas
syringae, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida
lineages. The Rositz sequences within the P. anguilliseptica
group originated from the extract after the first bead
treatment, while members of the P. syringae and P. fluorescens
lineages were more typical of the second/third bead
treatment (see origin of the sequences in legend of
Fig. 1b). An isolate similar to the Rositz sequences of the
P. putida group was obtained in an earlier study of the
microflora in biomass-recycle reactors (Morgan et al., 2002).
Another larger group of Rositz sequences within the
Gammaproteobacteria showed high similarity to Acinetobacter spp. (Fig. 1a). It could be discerned on the basis
of the phylogenetic distribution that the Rositz sequences
formed two clusters within the Moraxellaceae. A cluster of
seven Rositz sequences of the Acinetobacter group contained
mostly sequences from the extract from the second/third bead
treatment, and most of the other Moraxellaceae-like Rositz
sequences were from the first extract.
Eight of the 11 Rositz sequences which belonged to the clone
TRS13 group were obtained in the first bead treatment
(Fig. 1a). Clone TRS13 was the closest relative of Rositz
sequences and was originally found in an investigation of the
phylogenetic diversity of bacterial communities in rhizosphere soil of Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens (Marilley
& Aragno, 1999). Some individual sequences of the Rositz
sample affiliated with the Xanthomonadaceae (Fig. 1a).
Diversity beyond Gammaproteobacteria
Alphaproteobacteria. Most clones related to Alphaproteobacteria were similar to Sphingomonas spp.
(Fig. 2), and most of these sequences were obtained from
the first bead treatment. The phylogenetic distribution
demonstrated two main groups within the Sphingomonadaceae. One of the clusters affiliated to the
Sphingobium lineage and the second to Zymomonas mobilis
subsp. mobilis. The Sphingobium lineage also harbours the
strain Sphingomonas sp. DhA-95, which was originally isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated Arctic soil and has
the ability to degrade alkanes and jet fuel (Yu et al., 2000).
Six of the eight Rositz sequences which belonged to the
Zymomonas group originated from the second/third bead
treatment.
Betaproteobacteria. The Rositz clones showed a wide dis-

tribution in the phylogenetic tree of Betaproteobacteria
(Fig. 3). However, three larger groups with eight to 12
sequences each were recognizable. The sequences of interest
affiliated to the genera Rhodoferax, Acidovorax and
http://mic.sgmjournals.org

Thiobacillus, respectively. The three larger sequence groups
demonstrated an even distribution between the first and
second/third bead treatments.
The sequences of the Rositz Rhodoferax group were related
to sequences obtained from an aquatic system (clone GKS277; Glöckner et al., 2000) and from flooded paddy soil cores
(clone oxSCC-37; Lüdemann et al., 2000). A similar
sequence to the Rositz Thiobacillus group (clone RB7C6)
was found in monochlorobenzene-contaminated groundwater (Alfreider et al., 2002). Some more sequences could be
affiliated to an uncultured bacterium (clone 36-9) which
dominated the clone library from an aquifer contaminated
with coal tar waste (Bakermans & Madsen, 2002). This
cluster consisted exclusively of Rositz sequences from the
first bead treatment.
Epsilonproteobacteria. The four Rositz sequences from

the Epsilonproteobacteria (Supplementary Fig. S2) were
related to sequences from oil or chlorobenzene-contaminated groundwater (Alfreider et al., 2002; Kodama &
Watanabe, 2003; Watanabe et al., 2000, 2002). The closest
cultured relative Sulfuricurvum kujiense [ATCC BAA-921
(T)] was isolated from oil-contaminated groundwater. It
was reported to oxidize sulfur compounds in crude oil and
to use the oxidation as an energy source under microaerobic or anaerobic conditions (Kodama & Watanabe, 2003).
Clones of Actinobacteria. The Actinobacteria-related
Rositz sequences were phylogenetically very diverse
(Fig. 4). Rositz1 Ro106 had a similar sequence to that of
clone LTUGr00156 from a soil with aged hydrocarbon
contamination (Iida et al., 2002; Kaplan & Kitts, 2004).
However, others, such as Rositz23 Ros27 representatives,
were similar to Propionibacterium acnes, which has also
been found at the brine–sea water interface (clone library
KT-2K; Eder et al., 2001). Rositz23 Ros6 representatives
were most similar to the sequence of Atopobium rimae
(ATTC 49626) from the human oral cavity (Dewhirst
et al., 2001; Paster et al., 2001).

Bacteroidetes were affiliated to Flavobacterium spp.
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The phylogenetic distribution
obtained two branches for these Rositz sequences, which
were related to different Flavobacterium species, i.e.
Flavobacterium aquatile and Flavobacterium gondwanense.
Firmicutes. The only sequence related to Firmicutes,

Rositz23 Ros53, was most similar to clone HuCB5 from
human colonic samples (Holda et al., 2002; Fig. 4).

DISCUSSION
The Shannon diversity indices of 3?93 (library Rositz1) and
3?78 (library Rositz23) of the investigated sample seem low
compared to those of other studies, which report Shannon
diversity indices between 4 and 5 for soils (Schloss &

Handelsman, 2005). One aspect might be that the Rositz
material came from an industrial area and that significant
portions of the material were from lower soil horizons, while
most other studies deal with soil from the A and B horizons
of biologically active areas. Furthermore, Shannon indices of
3?76 for surface material and 3?70 for subsurface material
(1–7 cm) were determined in a study of stony, gravely sand
sampled in Antarctica, and the diversities were significantly
lower (2?76 and 2?93, respectively) for hydrocarboncontaminated soil from the same area (Saul et al., 2005).
The soil with aged petroleum contamination which was
studied by Kaplan & Kitts (2004) showed a Shannon
diversity index of 1?45, which increased to 1?6 during the
first 3 months of treatment. The latter values were
calculated based on terminal restriction fragment length
3298

polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis and are therefore not
directly comparable to sequence-based calculations, but
there is an obvious trend towards lower Shannon indices in
soils with aged hydrocarbon contamination. The detected
sequence diversities in the two extracts of this study were
similar.
FST regards only species (here, OTUs) which are common to
both samples (here, libraries). Therefore the low FST is due
to the overlap between the two OTU collections. Such an
overlap has to be expected when a fractionated analysis of
the extracts of one sample is done. However, calculation of
FST does not regard abundance of individual OTUs in the
two samples. The results of the P and FST tests do not
support the null hypothesis that samples Rositz1 and

Rositz23 originate from the same community. Based on the
existing dataset, the two clone libraries were considered to
differ significantly. To further compare the two datasets,
abundance-based Jaccard (Ĵabd) and Sorensen (Ŝabd)
estimates were calculated, in which unseen shared species
were also considered (Chao et al., 2005). The two estimators
[Ĵabd=0?7382 (variance 0?1900) and Ŝabd=0?8494 (0?1341)]
demonstrate that, if sample sizes were very large, one would
expect most sequences in the two libraries to belong to
OTUs which are shared between both libraries. As a
transition between the fractionated extracts suggests itself,
this result would be no surprise. The only difference which is
expected to be preserved is the different abundance variation
of certain OTUs in the individual libraries.
Predominance of Gammaproteobacteria
SSU rRNA sequencing reflected considerable diversity of the
microflora, in which, however, Gammaproteobacteria clearly
dominated. A similar phenomenon is known from cultivation-based analyses of environmental samples and has been
termed ‘c-shift’. It occurs under conditions of nutrient
oversupply (Amann et al., 1995). Given that in pristine soils
Bacillus spp. (Hugenholtz et al., 1998), Bacteroidetes, Grampositives with low GC content (Borneman et al., 1996),
Acidobacteria (Saul et al., 2005) and Alphaproteobacteria
(McCaig et al., 1999) are abundant, the dominance of
Gammaproteobacteria may result from the degradation of
high levels of contaminants. The ratio between
Proteobacteria and the Acidobacterium division might also
increase with the trophic level of soils (Smit et al., 2001), a
tendency which is also visible when bacterial communities
of hydrocarbon-contaminated and corresponding uncontaminated soils are compared (Saul et al., 2005). A c-shift
http://mic.sgmjournals.org

has also been reported to occur upon contamination of soil
(Chao & Hsu, 2004) and Arctic sea ice (Gerdes et al., 2005).
In the present case (Rositz), the contamination with 8000
milligrams mineral oil hydrocarbons per kilogram soil
dry weight provided a high nutrient supply for degraders.
This might have caused a c-shift, although the
ability to degrade mineral oil hydrocarbons is not limited
to Gammaproteobacteria (Mills et al., 2003; Radwan et al.,
1995; Vomberg & Klinner, 2000).
As a consequence of work with laboratory strains, the
pseudomonads, which dominate in this study, are often
considered as model organisms for pollutant degradation.
In fact, several studies of contaminated environments have
reported a dominance of pseudomonads. They are prevalent
in mineral oil hydrocarbon-contaminated soil under
bioremediation (Evans et al., 2004; Mills et al., 2003), but
also in pristine rhizosphere soils (Kuske et al., 1999; Marilley
& Aragno, 1999), which are commonly considered to be
nutrient-rich habitats. Pseudomonas isolates from pinyonjuniper woodland soils have been found to affiliate with the
P. syringae and P. fluorescens lineages (Kuske et al., 1999),
although, in contrast to our study, no members of the P.
aeruginosa and P. putida lineages were obtained in that
study.
Pseudomonas spp. increased transiently in the early phase of
a bioremediation test on soil with mineral oil contamination
(Kaplan & Kitts, 2004). This implies that pseudomonads
degrade mainly those pollutants which are fully bioavailable
(Heiss-Blanquet et al., 2005). At the end of this process,
when most of the contamination was gone, other microorganisms were most prevalent (Kaplan & Kitts, 2004).
Preliminary quantitative data on Rositz 3 provide a similar

impression, with the prevalence of pseudomonads decreasing over the time-course of treatment (data not shown).
The Moraxellaceae contributed another significant portion of
the clone libraries (Fig. 1a). A high prevalence of
Acinetobacter has been reported mostly in connection with
diesel contamination. Thus, the Acinetobacter concentration
was reported to increase in soil within a few days of
contamination with diesel (Chao & Hsu, 2004).
Acinetobacter were also the most abundant diesel-degrading
isolates during a bioremediation test with diesel-contaminated sandy soil (Gallego et al., 2001), which was
biostimulated with nutrients and periodically tilled for
aeration. Alkanindiges illinoisensis is able to degrade linear
alkane hydrocarbons with a chain length below C16 (Bogan
et al., 2003).
Four Rositz sequence types affiliated with the Xanthomonadaceae (Fig. 1a). The genus Xanthomonas has
been detected in petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated
soils (Juck et al., 2000). It has also been reported that soil
isolates related to Xanthomonas spp. and Stenotrophomonas
spp. are able to utilize alkanes (Tesar et al., 2002).

group have also been obtained from an oil-enriched
microcosm (Yakimov et al., 2005), and the genus
Methylobacterium has been detected in petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soils (Juck et al., 2000).
The Rositz sequences of Betaproteobacteria showed a striking
relationship to sequences or strains from contaminated or
pristine aquatic ecosystems, in which members of this class
dominate. Rhodoferax and Acidovorax-related Rositz
sequences were quite common among the Rositz clones.
However, no degradation potential for mineral oil hydrocarbons has been described for the phototrophic Rhodoferax.
The genus Acidovorax predominated in enrichments from
northern soils with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as
carbon source (Eriksson et al., 2003). However, similar
sequences to the Rositz clones have been found in an aquatic
habitat (Huber et al., 2003). Another cluster of sequences was
similar to those of Thiobacillus, a genus which is known for
autotrophic oxidation of sulfur compounds, although some
species can also grow heterotrophically (Kelly et al., 2005). A
sequence similar to Thiobacillus (clone RB7C6) has also been
found in monochlorobenzene-contaminated groundwater
(Alfreider et al., 2002).

Another two Rositz sequences affiliated with the alkane
degrader Hydrocarboniphaga effusa, a novel member of the
Gammaproteobacteria from soil contaminated with fuel oil
(Palleroni et al., 2004).

An uncultured bacterium (clone 36-9) dominated the clone
library from an aquifer contaminated with coal tar waste
(Bakermans & Madsen, 2002), a contamination similar to
that of Rositz. Significant numbers of this kind of sequence
were also found in the clone libraries of this study.

Diversity beyond Gammaproteobacteria: known
degraders and unexpected genera

Actinobacteria are dominant in pristine soils and sediments
(Macnaughton et al., 1999; Saul et al., 2005), and they
grow slowly, in contrast to Pseudomonas spp. (Bouchez
et al., 1997; Vildanova-Martsishin et al., 2002). Some
Actinobacteria have been described as able to degrade
mineral oil hydrocarbons or related substrates (Greene et al.,
2000). Rositz1 Ro106 had a similar sequence to that of clone
LTUGr00156 from soil with aged hydrocarbon contamination (Iida et al., 2002; Kaplan & Kitts, 2004). However, the
closest relatives of all other Actinobacteria sequences in this
study did not appear to be of importance with respect to
mineral oil hydrocarbon contamination.

The detected Alphaproteobacteria were mostly sphingomonads, which are characteristic of a variety of subsurface
environments, and which are known for their broad
degradation potential (Thiel et al., 2005; Vomberg &
Klinner, 2000). Consequently, such micro-organisms
might have played a significant role in the bioremediation
of the investigated soil. Similar to the present analysis,
sphingomonads represented a dominant group besides the
pseudomonads in a bioreactor treating petroleum-contaminated soil (Mills et al., 2003). However, Sphingomonas
prevalence has been low in other bioremediation systems
investigated with culture-independent methods (Kaplan &
Kitts, 2004), or sphingomonads have not been included in
corresponding hybridization analyses (Chao & Hsu, 2004).
The other main Rositz lineage of Alphaproteobacteria
consisted of Zymomonas members, which are typically
isolated from ethanol-fermenting samples (Dien et al.,
2003), and not in degrading soil samples. Rositz sequences
showed greater similarities to members of aquatic microflora, such as Sphingomonas sp. B18 (O’Sullivan et al., 2002;
Urbach et al., 2001; Wolf et al., 2003) than to the typical
ethanol-producing Zymomonas. The other Rositz sequences
of this class showed a high similarity to the methylotrophic
Methylobacterium spp. and to Rhodobacter sphaeroides, a
facultative photoheterotrophic bacterium (Dryden &
Kaplan, 1990). Sequences related to the Rhodobacteriaceae
3300

Flavobacteria are chemo-organotrophic, and are isolated
from soil and aquatic samples, but also from diseased fish.
Members of the genus Flavobacterium have previously been
reported to increase in the mid phase of a bioremediation
process on petroleum-contaminated soil (Kaplan & Kitts,
2004). Sequences similar to the Rositz sequences have been
obtained from a well-ventilated agricultural soil (clone S026;
Furlong et al., 2002), but also from groundwater with aged
chlorophenol contamination (Männistö et al., 1999) and
groundwater biofilms (Ross et al., 2001).

hydrocarbon (Evans et al., 2004; Kaplan & Kitts, 2004; Plaza
et al., 2003; Radwan et al., 1995). On the one hand, it is
difficult to draw general conclusions on the microflora in
hydrocarbon-contaminated soil from a small number of
individual analyses, considering the broad spectrum of
possible pollutants and the varying conditions with respect
to age of the contamination, humidity of the soil, land use,
etc. On the other hand, rules regarding the occurrence
of micro-organisms appear to exist; for example, Sphingomonas species have been detected in all investigated soils
with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contamination,
independently of the geological and chemical properties
of the soils and their geographic origin (Leys et al., 2004).
The analyses of microbial diversity in mineral oil hydrocarbon-contaminated soils at the SSU rDNA level have
shown some differences to the SSU rRNA analysis of the
Rositz heap in this study. Juck et al. (2000) found
Actinobacteria to be dominant in a cold-adapted bacterial
community in petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated
soils with no degradation activity. Also Proteobacteria
were abundant, in particular Gammaproteobacteria and
Alphaproteobacteria. A number of sphingomonads were
detected, but no pseudomonads, which were the dominant
genus in the active stage of bioremediation of heap Rositz 3.
The bioreactor samples investigated by Mills et al. (2003)
were originally amended with inorganic nutrients (nitrogen : phosphate, 16 : 1) and had a similar phylogenetic
distribution to that of the Rositz sample. Pseudomonads
and sphingomonads were most abundant. In contrast,
Acinetobacter spp., which also have a known degradation
potential for mineral oil hydrocarbons, Acidovorax spp. and
Rhodoferax spp. were not detected. Kaplan & Kitts (2004)
investigated a treatment unit for petroleum-contaminated
land, in which the soil heap had been contaminated with
2440 milligrams petroleum hydrocarbon per kilogram soil,
i.e. one-third of the Rositz contamination. The authors
analysed clone libraries from samples taken at day 14 (initial
fast-degradation phase) and at day 56 (slow-degradation
phase). The clone library of day 14 was dominated by
Flavobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Azoarcus spp.,
and it showed some differences to the Rositz analysis.
Interestingly the analysis of the clone library of day 56
contained the same genera as found in Rositz soil, although
the latter, because of its higher contamination level, might
still have been in an earlier degradation phase, perhaps one
comparable with day 14 of the petroleum-contaminated
land treatment.
Considering the differences in contamination, soil types and
treatment procedures, it is interesting overall to note that the
rRNA-based analysis in this study revealed several genera,
e.g. Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Acinetobacter, Acidovorax
and Flavobacterium, as probably important that have
previously been reported to be relevant in rDNA-based
studies.
Overall, sequences obtained from the bioremediation
system Rositz 3 had a wide phylogenetic distribution.
http://mic.sgmjournals.org

Similar clones or strains have been found in a variety of
habitats, some of which were contaminated with mineral oil
hydrocarbons and others of which were pristine. According
to the literature, representatives of nearly all related genera
can degrade such contamination. Some genera, however,
such as Zymomonas and Rhodoferax, have so far not been
found in soils with mineral oil hydrocarbon contamination.
Effects of sequential nucleic acid extraction
The initial hypothesis was that a greater number of
sequences from bacteria which are hard to lyse would be
found in extracts after more than one bead treatment.
Because of their cell wall structure, Gram-positive bacteria
are harder to lyse than Gram-negative bacteria (Bürgmann
et al., 2001). However, sequences from Gram-positive
bacteria were as infrequent in the extract after three bead
treatments of the soil sample as in the extract after the first
bead treatment. Furthermore, the sequences from the two
sequential extractions showed no significant difference in
phylogenetic distribution at the phylum or subphylum level
(Table 1).
A more detailed analysis, however, demonstrated that
certain sequences were specific to one of the sequential
extractions. Some genera were only detected in one of the
two sequential extracts. For example, Sphingomonas
sequences were detectable predominantly in the first extract,
and Zymomonas in the second/third extract (Fig. 2).
Sequences of genera which were detected in both extracts
often formed separate sequence clusters for the first bead
treatment and the second/third treatment. For example, P.
anguilliseptica was typical for the first, and P. syringae was
typical for the second/third extract (Fig. 1b). Acidovoraxrelated sequences also formed two clusters, in which the
extracts were represented to different extents (Fig. 3).
Different frequencies of sequences in the sequential extracts
do not necessarily result from differences in cell wall
stability. An alternative assumption is that most of the
nucleic acids extracted by the second bead treatment
originated from micro-organisms located inside soil
particles, and that nucleic acids from the first bead treatment
were obtained mostly from micro-organisms located at the
outside of the soil particles. Then, the extraction of nucleic
acids by sequential bead beating would have resulted in the
lysis of micro-organisms from different soil niches, i.e.
inside or outside soil particles (Bürgmann et al., 2001;
Ranjard & Richaume, 2001). Different degraders will coexist
in contaminated soil, and selection might be based, among
other factors, on the bioavailability of the contaminant
(Friedrich et al., 2000; Grosser et al., 2000). Microorganisms inside soil particles might be adapted to degrade
mineral oil hydrocarbons, which are adsorbed to natural
organic matter and consequently available to fewer microorganisms than the free compounds. In addition, changes of
redox potential have been reported to be the factor with the
strongest effect on soil microflora subsequent to contamination (Fahy et al., 2005). The partial pressure of oxygen

inside soil particles will always be lower than that in the
outer layers of the particles, even in aerated soil systems such
as the one investigated here, and therefore related bacteria
with different frequencies in the sequential extracts might
also differ in their response to oxygen (e.g. preferring
microaerobic to aerobic conditions).
Abundant sequences in the clone libraries of the present
study probably included those micro-organisms which were
the main degraders of mineral oil hydrocarbons at this stage
of bioremediation, because only the active micro-organisms
were detected.
There are many different niches available in soil, providing
optimal conditions for many microbial consortia involved
in degradation. Not all members of a microbial community
will be active in degradation at every time point. A
succession of different members of the community has
been observed in other systems, even at the DNA level
(Kaplan & Kitts, 2004). At a later point in the bioremediation process, other bacteria would probably have been
detectable in the soil heap Rositz 3.
Further investigation of bioremediation system Rositz 3 at
other time points of the process should verify the presence of
the micro-organisms detected so far. The analysis of SSU
rRNA clarified the identity of the micro-organisms, but
provided no direct evidence of their function in the soil or
their metabolic potential. Determination of marker genes
for degradation of mineral oil hydrocarbons will be
necessary to address this aspect.
